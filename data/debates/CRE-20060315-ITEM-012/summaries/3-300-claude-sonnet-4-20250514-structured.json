{"speaker": "Edward McMillan-Scott,", "english": "Edward McMillan-Scott, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . \u2013 Mr President, it is a great pleasure to see you in the Chair at the beginning of this debate on the Euromed Parliamentary Assembly, which you do so much to elevate and enhance. Of colleagues here in the Chamber, the pioneers of the Euro-Mediterranean policy are very numerous on the left, but not so numerous on the centre-right, with the distinguished exceptions of Mr\u00a0Busuttil, Mr Kasoulides and Mrs Sa\u00effi, but more may come.\nAs was mentioned earlier today, Veronique De Keyser and I had the honour to meet the President of Palestine last night. We profoundly regret the circumstances in which he had to return home. I believe it is ironic and tragic that the two countries who talk most about encouraging democracy in the Middle East \u2013 the United Kingdom and the United States \u2013 should be the very countries who left their posts in Jericho yesterday. The governments of both those countries should have reinforced and not withdrawn their garrisons.\nIt would be appropriate at the Euromed Parliamentary Assembly that we should hear, particularly from the Council, where the responsibility lay for the decisions, who took them, when and why they were taken. I hope that, if possible, we will get a statement from the Council at that meeting, with the assistance of the Commission.\nThe work of the Euromed is based largely on its committees. We are deeply grateful for the work that takes place there and for the opportunity that the Assembly provides, uniquely in the world, for Palestine and Israel to work together. It is an unusual meeting, taking place on the eve of an Israeli election, and following the election in Palestine on 25\u00a0January. It may be that representatives from those two countries are not present, but that does not mean they have gone out of our minds. They are very much at the forefront of our concerns. I believe that this meeting \u2013 the last under your chairmanship under the Presidency of the European Parliament \u2013 will be a great opportunity for the Commission, the Council and Parliament to underline our commitment to giving the parliamentary dimension of the Mediterranean real substance.\nI hope that the work I am doing on my subcommittee may give the European Parliament the opportunity to become the operational and organisational heart of the Euromed Assembly in the future. That is my intention.\n(Applause)", "lang": "EN", "original": "Edward McMillan-Scott, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . \u2013 Mr President, it is a great pleasure to see you in the Chair at the beginning of this debate on the Euromed Parliamentary Assembly, which you do so much to elevate and enhance.
