{"speaker": "V\u00e9ronique De Keyser (PSE).", "english": "V\u00e9ronique De Keyser (PSE). \u2013 (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, there was nothing random about the events in Jericho, which have deprived us of a meeting with Mahmoud\u00a0Abbas; they are politically significant. The first person to be affected was certainly Mahmoud\u00a0Abbas; hardly had he left his country than the Israeli forces launched their assault on the prison.\nHe is not the only one to be affected, though. It has not been mentioned that Ahmed Sa\u2019adat was a member of the newly-elected Palestinian legislative council. Nor has anyone pointed out that Hamas, which had made tentative steps towards recognising the State of Israel within its 1967 borders, could not proceed any further towards such recognition, after the humiliating images of half-naked, bound and blindfolded prisoners.\nWe Europeans have also been snubbed. We were expecting Mahmoud Abbas but he did not come. What is at stake is our entire policy towards Palestine. Today, with our offices ransacked and our nationals taken hostage, there are some Members of this Chamber saying to me that we, the main donors, must not continue to finance Palestine, after the ingratitude shown. That has been the effect of Jericho.\nI should like to say to those MEPs hesitating about supporting Palestine that there is not one Palestinian today who would not swap the money we are giving to Palestine for a firm EU stance on current events. Can we, after all, turn a blind eye to the fact that Israel has chosen a unilateral path, focused on law and order, which no longer has anything to do with the roadmap? The Olmert plan is a unilateral one, as were the Gaza disengagement - warmly applauded as it was - the annexing of the West Bank and the capture of East Jerusalem. The reality of Palestine is an interminable occupation and a wall which was condemned by the Hague but which is still standing. All the money that we give to Palestine to help it survive does not enable it to escape this reality. In other words, the peace process is dragging its feet.\nTo conclude, Commissioner, if there is to be a Plan\u00a0B to help Palestine, Europe must take a clear and courageous stance. How otherwise can the Palestinians be expected to have hope and to believe us when we talk about the road map?", "lang": "FR", "original": "V\u00e9ronique De Keyser (PSE). - Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, Madame la Commissaire, les \u00e9v\u00e9nements de J\u00e9richo, qui nous ont priv\u00e9s de la rencontre avec Mahmoud\u00a0Abbas, ne sont pas un simple fait divers. Ils ont une signification politique. Le premier vis\u00e9 est certainement Mahmoud\u00a0Abbas, car \u00e0 peine avait-il quitt\u00e9 son pays que l\u2019assaut contre la prison \u00e9tait lanc\u00e9 par les forces isra\u00e9liennes.\nMais il n\u2019est pas le seul. On n\u2019a pas dit qu\u2019Ahmed Saadate \u00e9tait un membre du Conseil l\u00e9gislatif palestinien nouvellement \u00e9lu. On n\u2019a pas dit et on n\u2019a pas soulign\u00e9 que le Hamas, qui avait fait quelques pas timides vers la reconnaissance de l\u2019\u00c9tat d\u2019Isra\u00ebl en ses fronti\u00e8res de 1967, ne pouvait pas, apr\u00e8s les images humiliantes de ces prisonniers \u00e0 moiti\u00e9 nus, attach\u00e9s, les yeux band\u00e9s, avancer encore dans la reconnaissance d\u2019Isra\u00ebl.\nLe camouflet a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 pour nous, Europ\u00e9ens. Nous attendions Mahmoud Abbas: il n\u2019est pas venu. C\u2019est toute notre politique vis-\u00e0-vis de la Palestine qui est en jeu. Et aujourd\u2019hui, face \u00e0 nos bureaux saccag\u00e9s et au kidnapping de nos ressortissants, des d\u00e9put\u00e9s dans cette enceinte me disent: on ne va pas, nous, les principaux donateurs, continuer \u00e0 financer la Palestine! Quels ingrats! C\u2019est cela l\u2019effet de J\u00e9richo.\nJe voudrais dire aux coll\u00e8gues qui h\u00e9sitent \u00e0 soutenir la Palestine qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas un Palestinien aujourd\u2019hui qui ne troquerait l\u2019argent que nous donnons \u00e0 la Palestine contre une position politique claire de l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne sur les \u00e9v\u00e9nements actuels. Car pouvons-nous taire aujourd\u2019hui qu\u2019Isra\u00ebl a choisi une voie unilat\u00e9rale et s\u00e9curitaire, qui n\u2019a plus rien \u00e0 voir avec la feuille de route. Le plan Olmert est unilat\u00e9ral, comme l\u2019\u00e9tait le d\u00e9sengagement -\u00a0applaudi d\u2019ailleurs\u00a0- de Gaza, comme l\u2019est l\u2019annexion de la rive du Jourdain et la mainmise sur J\u00e9rusalem-Est. Telle est la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 de la Palestine: une interminable occupation, un mur condamn\u00e9 par La Haye, mais qui est toujours debout. Et tout l\u2019argent que nous donnons \u00e0 la Palestine pour l\u2019aider \u00e0 survivre ne lui permet pas d\u2019\u00e9chapper \u00e0 cette r\u00e9alit\u00e9. En d\u2019autres termes, la paix marche aujourd\u2019hui \u00e0 reculons.\nEn conclusion, Madame la Commissaire, s\u2019il faut un plan\u00a0B pour aider la Palestine, il faut aussi et surtout que l\u2019Europe prenne une position politique courageuse et claire. Comment voulez-vous, sinon, que les Palestiniens aient encore de l\u2019espoir et qu\u2019ils nous croient, quand nous parlons de la feuille de route?", "agenda_item": "Euro-Mediterranean policy/preparation for the next meeting of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060315-ITEM-012", "intervention_id": "3-309", "summary_english": "{\n  \"headline\": \"EU Must Take Firm Stance on Palestine-Israel Conflict Beyond Financial Aid to Restore Peace Process\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"The speaker addresses the failure of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to attend the Euro-Mediterranean meeting due to Israeli military action in Jericho, the impact on the Palestinian peace process, and the effectiveness of EU policy toward Palestine.
