This institution is already experiencing a number of structural difficulties. Some partner states have yet to structure their national networks, and there have been serious delays in disbursing contributions. There is the greatest uncertainty as to whether funding will continue after 2008.\nThis is why these difficulties must be addressed forthwith: the continued financing of the Anna Lindh Foundation must be guaranteed; the measures undertaken by the foundation and the priorities thereof must be accorded higher visibility; European rules on the funding of projects must be relaxed; a European television station in Arabic must be set up; and the structure\u2019s three working languages must be put on an equal footing in communications.\nTo conclude, the EMPA, along with the Council and the Commission, must put the necessary effort into examining this question.", "lang": "FR", "original": "B\u00e9atrice Patrie (PSE). - Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, Madame la Commissaire, Monsieur le Ministre, chers coll\u00e8gues, en tant que pr\u00e9sidente de la d\u00e9l\u00e9gation parlementaire europ\u00e9enne pour les relations avec les pays du Machrek, je m\u2019associe, bien entendu, \u00e0 ce qui vient d\u2019\u00eatre dit sur les r\u00e9cents \u00e9v\u00e9nements en Palestine et, en particulier, \u00e0 la condamnation de l\u2019action contre la prison de J\u00e9richo, qui ne va certainement pas dans le sens de la paix et de la d\u00e9mocratie.\nJe voudrais \u00e9voquer, justement, une question qui contribue au dialogue entre les civilisations et qui a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un groupe de travail de l\u2019Assembl\u00e9e parlementaire eurom\u00e9diterran\u00e9enne, \u00e0 savoir la question de la Fondation Anna Lindh.
