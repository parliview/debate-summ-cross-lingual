{"speaker": "Benita Ferrero-Waldner,", "english": "Benita Ferrero-Waldner, Member of the Commission . Mr President, I entirely agree on the importance of the next Euromed Parliamentary Assembly meeting. It is highly important and I can already confirm my personal presence. This time it is possible and I certainly will want to come.\nYour motion for a resolution is an excellent one. All the important topics are there: freedom of expression and respect for religious beliefs, the outlook for a real partnership. That is what we want. That means that not only do we have to deliver, but our partners also have to deliver. Together we have to find the right mix in order for them to develop more and more. There are some specific issues that we also have to highlight, one of which is very dear to my heart and is also in our communication: education. I have always felt that with education we can promote the next generation. We can do our utmost to make things happen.\nI also totally agree with Mr Carnero Gonz\u00e1lez. I believe Barcelona was a success. However, is not right to say that it was not a complete success because only Heads of State were there. The content was good. Now we have to see to it that it can all be implemented in our five-year programme. I am in favour of liberalisation, but I agree it must also take account of social cohesion and social stability, social rights, questions of energy, and of course education.\nLet me quickly say that some studies that have been undertaken; the Manchester study is rather negative, but there are others that are much more positive. As I said, what we wanted to create with the Euromed Partnership is exactly that: a partnership, which means both sides will have to do their utmost to get things moving and quite a lot of reforms are still necessary.\nWhat we would like to achieve, with more trade, is also the creation of more jobs \u2013 that means more jobs for more young people \u2013 as also, of course, trying to provide the right prospects for the labour market, and sustainable development that takes account of social and environmental imperatives. The Neighbourhood Policy is the policy that tries to complement this Euromed Partnership. While also focusing very clearly on human rights, it tries to promote all the other factors that will assure these countries a better life in the future.\nFinally, unfortunately all of that is being overshadowed by the Israeli/Palestinian conflict, and unfortunately, this is not the best moment; we are at a very critical, crucial moment. Hopefully we can make the future, even at this critical stage, a better one.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Benita Ferrero-Waldner, Member of the Commission .
