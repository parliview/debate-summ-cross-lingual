{"speaker": "Simon Busuttil (PPE-DE).", "english": "Simon Busuttil (PPE-DE). \u2013 (MT) It is a pity that no sooner than we take a step forward in the Barcelona Process, than something happens in the Middle East which sets back the development we would have made. However I wish to remain focused on our theme and I wish to talk as a member of the Economic Commission of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly. I wish that both the Commission as well as the Council analyse a study which was done by the University of Manchester entitled \u2018Sustainable Impact Assessment Study of the Euromed Free-Trade Area\u2019. We started to discuss this study in the Economic Commission of the Assembly and it gives a worrying picture of the impact of the European Union\u2019s policy on the setting up of a free trade area in the Mediterranean. It forecasts a rather negative effect on our partner countries in the Mediterranean who are supposed to benefit and not lose by the Barcelona Process. Among the negative effects it mentions the possibility that in these countries there could be an increase in unemployment, a decrease in the level of wages, as well as a great impact on resources such as water and biodiversity and other environmental impacts. Naturally the report is not telling us to halt or to dismantle the plan for the setting up of a free-trade area, but it is saying that we should take these negative effects seriously and we should take preventive measures now, before it is too late. Therefore I wish to ask both the Commission as well as the Council to tell us what is their opinion about this study and what measures they intend to take to address any negative impact which could be brought about by the setting up of a free trade area in the Mediterranean. For example there is the need, no doubt, that the European Union policy towards these countries should balance the commercial aspect with a more intensive cooperation in the financial, social and educational sector as well as in the environmental sector. I conclude by appealing to both the Commission as well as to the Council to take a more active part in the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly and also to reply to the questions put by the Members of Parliament.", "lang": "MT", "original": "Simon Busuttil (PPE-DE). \u2013 Hija \u0127asra li hekk kif nag\u0127mlu pass 'il quddiem fil-Pro\u010bess ta' Bar\u010bellona, ji\u0121i xi \u0127a\u0121a fil-Lvant Nofsani li ter\u0121a' tibg\u0127atna lura mill-i\u017cvilupp li nkunu g\u0127amilna.
