{"speaker": "Jamila Madeira (PSE).", "english": "Jamila Madeira (PSE). \u2013 (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following the recent tragic events, the abundantly clear conclusions of our last meeting in November have taken on particular relevance. Economic prosperity and social progress are not within everyone\u2019s reach, which means that issues of violence are very visible.\nWe already know that those denied healthcare and the right to acquire qualitative and quantitative knowledge tend to be our partners in the southern Mediterranean and in particular the least privileged sections of society, that is, women and the poor.\nThe future scenario concerns us. This is particularly the case if we assess the impact on sustainability of the Euro-Mediterranean free trade zone, which we want to see up and running by 2010, as the Commissioner pointed out. In this case, the data shows that in terms of reducing poverty, the immediate gains are considerably lower, although other benefits may accrue from the far-reaching changes taking place in the economies of our Mediterranean partners. In the areas of health and education, there is little chance of any short-term gains. Accordingly, with nothing to hold back this effect, it is likely that we will see health and education being adversely affected.\nAs regards human rights, it is vital that we look into the near-total absence of a guiding concept in the EU and the Euro-Mediterranean institutions on the issue of economic and social rights and the part that this plays in the Barcelona process.\nI feel that in the current framework in particular \u2013 albeit, in reality, across the board \u2013 this is a vitally important question, which should be given due prominence in the MEDA programme.\nOur most pressing priorities in this partnership should be to step up social dialogue, the fight against child labour, cooperation in combating discrimination in the field of social security, dialogue on social reforms and promoting equal opportunities between men and women.\nIn the context of today's reality, this issue should be brought to the fore in the Barcelona process.", "lang": "PT", "original": "Jamila Madeira (PSE). \u2013 Senhor Presidente, Senhores Deputados, no seguimento dos \u00faltimos e tr\u00e1gicos acontecimentos, as conclus\u00f5es da nossa \u00faltima reuni\u00e3o em Novembro, que foram bem claras, tornam-se de sobremaneira pertinentes.
