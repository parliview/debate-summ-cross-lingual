{"speaker": "Luisa Morgantini,", "english": "Luisa Morgantini, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group . \u2013 (IT) Mr\u00a0President, ladies and gentlemen, at the Karni crossing checkpoint in Gaza, a man called Ayman told me he wished us and our money to the devil, not because he did not actually accept our help, and was ungrateful for it, but to say that he and his people had had enough, that they needed freedom and dignity and not just humanitarian aid. At the same time we ourselves cannot have an easy conscience just because we continue to help; what we really need to do is continue to help the Palestinians.\nYesterday\u2019s action, like so many others, was illegal, cynical and inhumane. Illegal because it was illegal, but cynical because it was done with a thought to the elections. It was actually an example of vengeance and brutal colonialism. I think it is time Israel understood that its very existence, its very love for democracy, can only exist if it respects other peoples. Yet Israel is not doing this, and we certainly cannot be a party to this, and we are not.\nThe Commission and the Council stated this very openly this morning. Our Parliamentary Assembly is extremely important, but we ought to face up to a problem: the involvement of Palestinian representatives in the Parliamentary Assembly. We must accept absolutely the presence of whoever is recommended by the Palestinian Legislative Council.\nIt is a shame that this is happening the day before the Israeli elections because it means that an essential component of the Assembly will not be present. We must, however, make sure that the Assembly works, that it functions, not least because if we do not solve the Palestinian question our Assembly will constantly have as the focus of its discussions the subject of Palestine and Israel. Nor will we be able to confront the problems that the Commission and the Council have very clearly set forth, namely how to succeed in establishing a Mediterranean that is truly cooperative.", "lang": "IT", "original": "Luisa Morgantini, a nome del gruppo GUE/NGL . \u2013 Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, \u201cal diavolo voi e i vostri i soldi\u201d, cos\u00ec mi ha detto Ayman al Karni crossing checkpoint di Gaza, non perch\u00e9 in realt\u00e0 non accettasse i nostri aiuti e ne fosse ben felice, ma per dire \u201cbasta, abbiamo bisogno di libert\u00e0 e di dignit\u00e0, non soltanto di aiuti umanitari\u201d.
