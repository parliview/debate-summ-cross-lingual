We must therefore look to the future with greater determination and achieve results now.\nIn view of recent events, the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly is the ideal place to reinforce our partnership, on the basis of dialogue, exchange and mutual understanding. More than ever, the action of the EMPA needs to be reinforced and supported. More than ever, the objectives of establishing peace and guaranteeing security should be the focus of our decisions and accompanied by concrete action.\nUrgent action is needed in order to deal with a difficult local situation and an increasingly uncertain regional context. I believe that the European Union has a heavy responsibility today, and I am saying that as chairwoman of the political committee of the EMPA which, flanked by a Palestinian vice-president and an Israeli vice-president, wishes to place the resolution of the Middle East conflict at the heart of our work. The Union must speak with one voice and condemn the perversity of actions that increase the escalation of violence and undermine an already fragile peace process.\nIt is regrettable that the Palestinian President, Mahmoud Abbas, has not been able to speak to our Parliament following the events in Jericho, and I would like, in this Chamber, to express my concern about this situation.\nCommissioner, we have listened to you. We have noted your conviction and your will. In the EMPA and together with President Borrell, we are determined to move forward. I believe that it is time to stop disappointing the people.", "lang": "FR", "original": "Tokia Sa\u00effi (PPE-DE). - Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, Monsieur le Ministre, Madame le Commissaire, force est de constater que les travaux du Sommet de Barcelone n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 la hauteur des attentes face aux \u00e9normes enjeux.
