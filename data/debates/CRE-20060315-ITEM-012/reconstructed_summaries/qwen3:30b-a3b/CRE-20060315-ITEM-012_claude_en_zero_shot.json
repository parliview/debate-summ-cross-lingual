This cooperation is of the utmost importance, not only with regard to the Middle East issue, but also in other contexts. I do not wish to reiterate at this point what I have already said today on behalf of the Council about the events in the Middle East. In the meantime, the Presidency, too, has issued a statement on this. I should now like to turn to the Euromed process itself.\nThe Austrian Presidency follows on the heels of last November\u2019s Summit in Barcelona on the tenth anniversary of the first Barcelona Summit, which adopted a five-year work programme for the Partnership, oriented towards political and economic reforms, and also a Code of Conduct on Countering Terrorism. I believe that these documents and agreements are of the utmost importance.\nWe and our Mediterranean partners have also agreed to increase investment in education and to tackle together all aspects of legal and illegal immigration. That is another very important issue.\nIt is now up to the Austrian Presidency to work towards implementing all of these projects. This we shall do willingly, vigorously and with conviction. I should also like to take this opportunity to announce that a meeting of Trade Ministers is to be held in Marrakech on 24\u00a0March, and there will be a meeting of Euromed Finance Ministers in Tunis on 25\u00a0and 26\u00a0June.\nWe shall also be giving particular support to the Commission in prioritising the media, because we are convinced that the media plays a particularly important role in intercultural understanding. In this connection, the Euromed Seminar on Xenophobia and Racism in the Media that has been planned for a long time is now scheduled to be held in May, during the Austrian Presidency.\nAs the House has already heard from the Austrian Minister for Foreign Affairs, President of the General Affairs and External Relations Council, the Council has been intensely preoccupied with the issue of the caricatures in recent weeks, including at the informal meeting of Ministers for Foreign Affairs in Salzburg. This issue is another about which I have already had the opportunity to speak to you here. This problem, in particular, has made clear to us that we have to specifically take the route of forward-looking dialogue between the EU and the Islamic world and with Muslim communities in Europe. The Euro-Mediterranean Partnership offers an ideal, particularly important forum for the dialogue with Mediterranean countries in this regard. I consider this dialogue to be particularly important at all levels, particularly the direct contact between young people, and I believe that the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership can, and must, indeed play a key role. It was with this aim in view that the Anna Lindh Foundation for the Dialogue between Cultures was established last year. This Foundation has a key role to play, particularly at this time.\nThe Conclusions of the EU General Affairs and External Relations Council of 27\u00a0February\u00a02006 expressly mention the Barcelona process and the Anna Lindh Foundation, along with other multilateral organisations playing a role in this field, a fact that we consider most welcome.\nIt is now important to take all the available instruments of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership and use them to defuse tensions, such as those seen recently. A meeting of leading Euro-Mediterranean officials has already taken place, on 22\u00a0February: this enabled a very open exchange of views on the events and gave all the participants the opportunity to propose specific measures.\nIn essence, there is agreement on the fact that the structures required to tackle this problem are already in place; I do not believe that we should create new ones. The challenge for us now is to make use of all the appropriate opportunities for dialogue to successfully continue the long-standing efforts towards bringing the peoples on both sides of the Mediterranean closer together.\nThe Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly brings together representatives of the peoples on both sides of the Mediterranean. We expect it to make a particularly important contribution to further calming this situation and to better understanding.\nThe Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly has given the Barcelona process an urgently needed new dimension and, in particular, increased its legitimacy. Relevant working committees were put to work even at the stage of preparing for the Barcelona Summit in November\u00a02005.\nThe Committee on Political Affairs, Security and Human Rights of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly debated the problem of the caricatures calmly and in detail at its meeting on the sixth of this month and it, too, pointed to the necessity of increasing dialogue. I am convinced that the plenary session to be held on 26 and 27\u00a0March will also be able to provide an appropriate response to the questions that have arisen. The Austrian Presidency is following and supporting the diverse initiatives that are being taken in this regard.\nJust today, at the meeting of the Senior Officials Committee for the Barcelona process, the Euromed Committee, the title of a seminar to be held in Vienna was changed at the request of our Mediterranean partners, to take account of their request for religious feelings to be respected.\nIt is my conviction that there is scope for further improvement in communication between the traditional Euromed committees and the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly. I hope that, with a little imagination, we are able to achieve further progress on this issue under the Austrian Presidency, to the benefit of all of the Euromed committees and the Partnership as a whole.\nFurthermore, particularly in the light of current events, enhanced cooperation could be initiated, for example with the OSCE or even with the \u2018alliance of civilisations\u2019 \u2013 which, as we know, is a Spanish\u2013Turkish initiative under the auspices of the United Nations. Austria would like to continue its involvement in this wider context, and has already invited the High Level Group on the alliance of civilisations to hold its third meeting in Vienna at the end of May.", "lang": "DE", "original": "Hans Winkler, amtierender Ratspr\u00e4sident . Herr Pr\u00e4sident, Frau Kommissarin, meine sehr verehrten Damen und Herren! Wir haben im Zuge der heute aus aktuellem Anlass abgehaltenen kurzen Debatte \u00fcber den Nahen Osten zu Recht auch die euromediterrane Zusammenarbeit angesprochen. Dieser Zusammenarbeit kommt im Zusammenhang mit der Nahostproblematik, aber auch in anderen Zusammenh\u00e4ngen, eine gro\u00dfe Bedeutung zu. Ich m\u00f6chte an dieser Stelle nicht noch einmal wiederholen, was ich heute schon im Namen des Rates zu den Ereignissen im Nahen Osten gesagt habe. In der Zwischenzeit hat auch die Pr\u00e4sidentschaft eine Erkl\u00e4rung dazu abgegeben. Ich m\u00f6chte mich jetzt dem Euromed-Prozess selbst zuwenden.\nDer \u00f6sterreichische Vorsitz folgt auf den Gipfel in Barcelona im November des Vorjahres zum zehnten Jahrestag des ersten Gipfels von Barcelona, auf dem eine auf politische und wirtschaftliche Reformen ausgerichtete F\u00fcnfjahresagenda f\u00fcr die Partnerschaft sowie ein Verhaltenskodex zur Bek\u00e4mpfung des Terrorismus angenommen wurden. Ich glaube, dass diese Dokumente und \u00dcbereink\u00fcnfte von gr\u00f6\u00dfter Bedeutung sind.\nZudem haben wir auch mit unseren Partnern im Mittelmeerraum vereinbart, verst\u00e4rkt in Bildung zu investieren und gemeinsam alle Aspekte der legalen und illegalen Einwanderung anzugehen. Das ist ein weiteres sehr wichtiges Thema.\nEs ist nun an der \u00f6sterreichischen Pr\u00e4sidentschaft, sich f\u00fcr die Umsetzung all dieser Vorhaben einzusetzen. Wir werden das gerne und mit Nachdruck und \u00dcberzeugung tun. Ich m\u00f6chte an dieser Stelle auch ank\u00fcndigen, dass am 24.\u00a0M\u00e4rz in Marrakesch ein Treffen der f\u00fcr Handel zust\u00e4ndigen Minister sowie am 25. und 26. Juni in Tunis ein Treffen der Euromed-Finanzminister stattfinden werden.\nWir werden insbesondere auch die Kommission in ihrem Medienschwerpunkt unterst\u00fctzen, weil wir davon \u00fcberzeugt sind, dass gerade Medien eine bedeutende Rolle bei der Verst\u00e4ndigung der Kulturen spielen. In diesem Zusammenhang werden wir das seit langem geplante Euromed-Seminar \u00fcber Fremdenfeindlichkeit und Rassismus in den Medien nunmehr w\u00e4hrend der \u00f6sterreichischen Pr\u00e4sidentschaft im Mai abhalten.\nDas Thema der Karikaturen, zu dem ich an dieser Stelle auch schon Gelegenheit hatte, zu Ihnen zu sprechen, hat den Rat in den letzten Wochen \u2013 auch beim informellen Au\u00dfenministertreffen in Salzburg \u2013 sehr intensiv besch\u00e4ftigt. Sie haben das von der Vorsitzenden, der \u00f6sterreichischen Au\u00dfenministerin geh\u00f6rt. Gerade dieses Problem hat uns deutlich gemacht, dass wir gezielt den Weg eines zukunftsorientierten Dialogs der Europ\u00e4ischen Union mit der islamischen Welt und mit muslimischen Gemeinden in Europa gehen m\u00fcssen. Gerade die Europa-Mittelmeer-Partnerschaft bietet hier ein wichtiges, ideales Forum f\u00fcr den Dialog der L\u00e4nder im Mittelmeerraum. Ich halte diesen Dialog auf allen Ebenen, insbesondere auch den direkten Kontakt zwischen den jungen Menschen, f\u00fcr besonders wichtig, und ich glaube, dass die Europa-Mittelmeer-Partnerschaft in der Tat eine sehr wesentliche Rolle spielen kann und muss. Im vergangenen Jahr wurde zu diesem Zweck die Anna-Lindh-Stiftung f\u00fcr den Dialog zwischen den Kulturen gegr\u00fcndet. Diese Stiftung spielt gerade jetzt eine wesentliche Rolle.\nIn den Schlussfolgerungen des Rats der Au\u00dfenminister vom 27. Februar 2006 wurden der Barcelona-Prozess und die Anna-Lindh-Stiftung neben anderen multilateralen Organisationen, die in diesem Bereich eine Rolle spielen, ausdr\u00fccklich erw\u00e4hnt. Wir begr\u00fc\u00dfen das sehr.\nEs ist nun wichtig, dass wir alle vorhandenen Instrumente der Europa-Mittelmeer-Partnerschaft einsetzen und zur \u00dcberwindung von Spannungen \u2013 wie in der j\u00fcngsten Vergangenheit \u2013 heranziehen. Am 22. Februar hat bereits ein Treffen der leitenden Euromed-Beamten stattgefunden, das einen sehr offenen Gedankenaustausch \u00fcber die Geschehnisse erm\u00f6glicht und allen Teilnehmern die Gelegenheit geboten hat, konkrete Ma\u00dfnahmen vorzuschlagen.\nGrunds\u00e4tzlich besteht Einvernehmen dar\u00fcber, dass die f\u00fcr die Bew\u00e4ltigung dieses Problems erforderlichen Strukturen bereits bestehen. Ich glaube nicht, dass wir neue Strukturen schaffen sollten. Jetzt sind wir gefordert, alle sinnvollen M\u00f6glichkeiten f\u00fcr den Dialog zu nutzen, um die langj\u00e4hrigen Bem\u00fchungen um eine Ann\u00e4herung der V\u00f6lker auf beiden Seiten des Mittelmeers erfolgreich weiterzuf\u00fchren.\nDie Parlamentarische Versammlung der Europa-Mittelmeer-Partnerschaft vereinigt die Vertreter der V\u00f6lker auf beiden Seiten des Mittelmeers. Von ihnen erwarten wir in dieser Situation einen besonders wichtigen Beitrag zur weiteren Beruhigung der Lage und zum besseren Verst\u00e4ndnis.\nDie Parlamentarische Versammlung der Europa-Mittelmeer-Partnerschaft hat dem Barcelona-Prozess eine dringend erforderliche neue Dimension verliehen und insbesondere seine Legitimit\u00e4t erh\u00f6ht. Schon bei der Vorbereitung des Gipfels von Barcelona im November 2005 wurden entsprechende Arbeitsaussch\u00fcsse eingesetzt.\nDas politische Komitee der Parlamentarischen Versammlung hat in der Sitzung am sechsten des Monats das Karikaturenproblem in sachlicher Atmosph\u00e4re ausf\u00fchrlich debattiert und ebenfalls auf die Notwendigkeit eines verst\u00e4rkten Dialogs hingewiesen. Ich bin \u00fcberzeugt, dass auch die Vollversammlung am 26. und 27. M\u00e4rz eine ad\u00e4quate Antwort auf die aufgeworfenen Fragen geben k\u00f6nnen wird. Die \u00f6sterreichische Pr\u00e4sidentschaft verfolgt und unterst\u00fctzt die vielf\u00e4ltigen Initiativen, die in dieser Hinsicht gesetzt werden.\nGerade heute hat das h\u00f6chste Gremium auf Beamtenebene des Barcelona-Prozesses, das Euromed-Komitee, in seiner Sitzung den Titel eines Seminars, das in Wien stattfinden wird, auf Wunsch der mediterranen Partner ge\u00e4ndert, um deren Anliegen, religi\u00f6se Gef\u00fchle zu respektieren, Rechnung zu tragen.\nIch bin der \u00dcberzeugung, dass die Kommunikation zwischen den traditionellen Euromed-Gremien und der Parlamentarischen Versammlung der Europa-Mittelmeer-Partnerschaft noch verbessert werden kann. Ich hoffe, dass wir unter \u00f6sterreichischem Vorsitz mit etwas Phantasie zum Nutzen aller Euromed-Gremien und der Partnerschaft insgesamt weitere Fortschritte in dieser Frage erzielen k\u00f6nnen.\nAu\u00dferdem k\u00f6nnte gerade vor dem aktuellen Hintergrund eine verst\u00e4rkte Zusammenarbeit, etwa mit der OSZE oder auch mit der Allianz der Zivilisationen, bekanntlich eine spanisch-t\u00fcrkische Initiative unter UNO-Schirmherrschaft, angeregt werden. \u00d6sterreich m\u00f6chte sich weiterhin in diesem weiter gefassten Kontext engagieren und hat bereits zur Abhaltung des 3.

Mr President, we are here to discuss the Barcelona Process and the preparations for the next meeting of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly.\nLet me just say a few words about the recent events in the Palestinian territories, because today the time was so short during the speeches on the Gymnich and there were only two Commissioners. I ceded my place to Commissioner Rehn for the Western Balkans debate and now, if you permit me, I shall say a few words on yesterday's events. It is not only topical but also goes to the heart of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership, to our shared objective for a region of peace, stability, prosperity and opportunity. I fail to see how any of the actions yesterday in any way contributed to those objectives.\nThe Israeli attack on the prison in Jericho and the Israelis' public treatment of prison guards and inmates is unacceptable and should be condemned. I also deplore the violence, the kidnappings and the attacks on the Commission offices and other offices of the Member States in Gaza and the West Bank.\nThe first victims of this breakdown of law and order are the Palestinian people themselves. In the current circumstances, with key political deadlines ahead in both Israel and the Palestinian territories, it is more important than ever that both parties show restraint and responsibility. Attacks, such as the ones that took place yesterday, and provocative statements do nothing to improve prospects, and the Palestinian Authority must put an end to violence and insecurity. Yesterday evening, I had a good discussion \u2013 as you, Mr President, no doubt did \u2013 with President Abbas before he returned to deal with the mounting violence and confrontation. He is doing one of the most difficult jobs in the world just now, which was not made any easier by yesterday's events. How he manages to compose a new Palestinian Authority Government will affect the prospects for peace in the Middle East and will also have repercussions for us all.\nThe European Union is a reliable partner of the Palestinian people. No donor has done more to help them. I told President Abbas once again that we want to continue our support for a better, peaceful and prosperous future, but that we stand firm on our principles, leaving the door open to positive developments. All future assistance to a new Palestinian Authority Government will be reviewed in relation to its position on the key principles of an end to violence, recognition of Israel and compliance with the existing agreements, including the Roadmap. Those with whom President Abbas negotiates must know and understand that their decisions on their issues will have important repercussions.\nLet me now say a few words about the Euro-Med Partnership. The Barcelona Summit last November achieved notable results for the future. The five-year work programme agreed at the summit and the Code of Conduct on counter-terrorism constitute a very ambitious agenda which will render the partnership more tangible, more politically relevant and more operational.\nTo follow up on the summit, we must now ensure constructive and effective contributions by all partners to attain the commonly agreed objectives on political and economic reform, growth and job creation, human rights and gender issues, education and management of migration, regional stability and the fight against terrorism.\nThe Commission has already launched work on the implementation of that five-year programme. Initiatives have been taken with the current and the incoming Council Presidencies, as well as with Mediterranean partners, to ensure the success of this common endeavour. We have reserved appropriate funding for assistance and support, provided through MEDA and the future European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument, including a substantial facility to encourage progress on governance reform that we call a 'governance facility'.\nAs of this year, several new and innovative activities will be launched. Preparations are well under way to organise the first Euro-Med ministerial meeting on gender issues at the end of the year.\nTwo sub-regional conferences, one in the Maghreb and one in the Mashreq, will pave the way for government and civil society representatives to examine the importance of gender equality for economic and social development and propose practical measures to improve women\u2019s access to jobs and public life.\nAt the Barcelona Summit, Euro-Med partners highlighted the importance of migration, social integration, justice and security as issues of common interest in the partnership, which should be addressed through a balanced and comprehensive approach. Work has begun on preparing a ministerial meeting to tackle all issues from illegal migration to trafficking in human beings and people smuggling.\nThis regional initiative is complemented by our bilateral programmes aimed at strengthening institutional capacities, managing legal migration, improving border controls, fighting illegal immigration and people trafficking.\nMr Winkler has already mentioned the Trade Ministerial Meeting, which will be attended by Commissioner Mandelson and will advance the objective of a European free trade area.\nWe also hope to see similar progress on South-South trade \u2013 the 'Agadir process'. The so-called cartoon crisis has highlighted the dangers of leaving prejudice, misinformation and misunderstanding to fester.

Together, we want to realise the objectives of security, stability and prosperity.\n(Applause)", "lang": "EN", "original": "Benita Ferrero-Waldner, Member of the Commission . Mr President, we are here to discuss the Barcelona Process and the preparations for the next meeting of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly.\nLet me just say a few words about the recent events in the Palestinian territories, because today the time was so short during the speeches on the Gymnich and there were only two Commissioners. I ceded my place to Commissioner Rehn for the Western Balkans debate and now, if you permit me, I shall say a few words on yesterday's events. It is not only topical but also goes to the heart of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership, to our shared objective for a region of peace, stability, prosperity and opportunity. I fail to see how any of the actions yesterday in any way contributed to those objectives.\nThe Israeli attack on the prison in Jericho and the Israelis' public treatment of prison guards and inmates is unacceptable and should be condemned. I also deplore the violence, the kidnappings and the attacks on the Commission offices and other offices of the Member States in Gaza and the West Bank.\nThe first victims of this breakdown of law and order are the Palestinian people themselves. In the current circumstances, with key political deadlines ahead in both Israel and the Palestinian territories, it is more important than ever that both parties show restraint and responsibility. Attacks, such as the ones that took place yesterday, and provocative statements do nothing to improve prospects, and the Palestinian Authority must put an end to violence and insecurity. Yesterday evening, I had a good discussion \u2013 as you, Mr President, no doubt did \u2013 with President Abbas before he returned to deal with the mounting violence and confrontation. He is doing one of the most difficult jobs in the world just now, which was not made any easier by yesterday's events. How he manages to compose a new Palestinian Authority Government will affect the prospects for peace in the Middle East and will also have repercussions for us all.\nThe European Union is a reliable partner of the Palestinian people. No donor has done more to help them. I told President Abbas once again that we want to continue our support for a better, peaceful and prosperous future, but that we stand firm on our principles, leaving the door open to positive developments. All future assistance to a new Palestinian Authority Government will be reviewed in relation to its position on the key principles of an end to violence, recognition of Israel and compliance with the existing agreements, including the Roadmap. Those with whom President Abbas negotiates must know and understand that their decisions on their issues will have important repercussions.\nLet me now say a few words about the Euro-Med Partnership. The Barcelona Summit last November achieved notable results for the future. The five-year work programme agreed at the summit and the Code of Conduct on counter-terrorism constitute a very ambitious agenda which will render the partnership more tangible, more politically relevant and more operational.\nTo follow up on the summit, we must now ensure constructive and effective contributions by all partners to attain the commonly agreed objectives on political and economic reform, growth and job creation, human rights and gender issues, education and management of migration, regional stability and the fight against terrorism.\nThe Commission has already launched work on the implementation of that five-year programme. Initiatives have been taken with the current and the incoming Council Presidencies, as well as with Mediterranean partners, to ensure the success of this common endeavour. We have reserved appropriate funding for assistance and support, provided through MEDA and the future European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument, including a substantial facility to encourage progress on governance reform that we call a 'governance facility'.\nAs of this year, several new and innovative activities will be launched. Preparations are well under way to organise the first Euro-Med ministerial meeting on gender issues at the end of the year.\nTwo sub-regional conferences, one in the Maghreb and one in the Mashreq, will pave the way for government and civil society representatives to examine the importance of gender equality for economic and social development and propose practical measures to improve women\u2019s access to jobs and public life.\nAt the Barcelona Summit, Euro-Med partners highlighted the importance of migration, social integration, justice and security as issues of common interest in the partnership, which should be addressed through a balanced and comprehensive approach. Work has begun on preparing a ministerial meeting to tackle all issues from illegal migration to trafficking in human beings and people smuggling.\nThis regional initiative is complemented by our bilateral programmes aimed at strengthening institutional capacities, managing legal migration, improving border controls, fighting illegal immigration and people trafficking.\nMr Winkler has already mentioned the Trade Ministerial Meeting, which will be attended by Commissioner Mandelson and will advance the objective of a European free trade area.\nWe also hope to see similar progress on South-South trade \u2013 the 'Agadir process'. The so-called cartoon crisis has highlighted the dangers of leaving prejudice, misinformation and misunderstanding to fester. We regret the offence caused by those cartoons to Muslims across the world, but we also strongly condemned all violent acts and threats against individuals and property of the European Union and other countries. Support for intercultural dialogue at all levels is important. I am glad that in Salzburg this has been very strongly recommended.

The summary mentions several speakers and their contributions. The user specifically asked about Benita Ferrero-Waldner. \n\nLooking at the \"Institutional Leadership Positions\" section, there's a mention of Benita Ferrero-Waldner (European Commission). The key quote attributed to her is: \"All future assistance to a new Palestinian Authority Government will be reviewed in relation to its position on the key principles of an end to violence, recognition of Israel and compliance with the existing agreements, including the Roadmap\" [Ferrero-Waldner, 2006-03-15]. \n\nAdditionally, the summary states that she \"condemned recent violence in Jericho while reaffirming EU support for Palestinians contingent on non-violence principles.\" So her main points are about conditioning EU aid to the Palestinian Authority on their adherence to non-violence, recognition of Israel, and existing agreements like the Roadmap. \n\nI need to make sure I don't include other speakers' points. The user specified that only arguments from Benita Ferrero-Waldner should be included. The other parts of the summary mention other people, but I should focus only on her contributions. \n\nSo the main points are: \n1. Condemnation of violence in Jericho.\n2. EU support for Palestinians is conditional on non-violence, recognition of Israel, and compliance with existing agreements (Roadmap).\n\nI should present these as the key arguments made by her. There's no other information about her in the summary, so that's all I need to include.\n</think>\n\nBenita Ferrero-Waldner condemned recent violence in Jericho and emphasized that EU support for the Palestinian Authority would be contingent on adherence to key principles, including an end to violence, recognition of Israel, and compliance with existing agreements such as the Roadmap.

Let me look through the summary provided.\n\nThe user mentioned that the debate was about Euro-Mediterranean policy and preparations for the Parliamentary Assembly. The executive summary has several sections, including Institutional Leadership Positions, Parliamentary Group Perspectives, etc. \n\nLooking at the Parliamentary Group Perspectives section, there's a mention of Edward McMillan-Scott (PPE-DE) criticizing the UK and US withdrawal from Jericho. The quote is: \"It is ironic and tragic that the two countries who talk most about encouraging democracy in the Middle East \u2013 the United Kingdom and the United States \u2013 should be the very countries who left their posts in Jericho.\" \n\nSo his main argument here is that the UK and US are being hypocritical by leaving Jericho, given their usual stance on promoting democracy. The user wants only the points attributed to him, so I need to make sure not to include others. \n\nAre there any other mentions of him in the summary? Let me check the rest. The other sections talk about other speakers like Ferrero-Waldner, Napoletano, Flautre, etc. But under Parliamentary Group Perspectives, only McMillan-Scott's comment is listed. \n\nSo the only point is his criticism of the UK and US withdrawal from Jericho, pointing out the irony and tragedy. There's no other contribution from him mentioned. Therefore, the answer should be that one point.\n</think>\n\nEdward McMillan-Scott criticized the UK and US withdrawal from Jericho, stating: \"It is ironic and tragic that the two countries who talk most about encouraging democracy in the Middle East \u2013 the United Kingdom and the United States \u2013 should be the very countries who left their posts in Jericho.\"", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Pasqualina Napoletano,", "english": "Pasqualina Napoletano, on behalf of the PSE Group . \u2013 (IT) Mr\u00a0President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the dramatic events of the last few hours in Palestine force us to reach a view and, as you said, Commissioner, go right to the heart of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership.\nI would like to say to the Israeli authorities that an electoral campaign, however important, cannot permit the distortion of existing legal frameworks. One of these frameworks, the main one, is the role of President\u00a0Abu\u00a0Mazen, damaged and deprived of authority by the irresponsible attack on the prison in Jericho and by the capture of prisoners whose detention was the competence of the Palestinian authority. I would also like to hear a view from the Council on the conduct of the United Kingdom and United States forces present in the area.\nAll our moral and political support goes to the President of the Palestinian Authority, who should have been among us here today. We are aware of his very difficult position, particularly after the result of the legislative elections in Palestine. As you said, Commissioner, Europe must remind the Israeli authorities of the need to respect the law and their legitimate partners, just as we demand of Hamas itself. Defying the legal framework means opening the door to the sort of retaliation and violence that is already going on and that we need to try and stem. We are relieved in this matter by news of the freeing of the hostages.\nAs for the crisis in Iran, another sorry chapter, I welcomed the words of Mr\u00a0Straw, which I hope he will hold to completely. He stated that no military option exists.

One of these frameworks, the main one, is the role of President\u00a0Abu\u00a0Mazen, damaged and deprived of authority by the irresponsible attack on the prison in Jericho and by the capture of prisoners whose detention was the competence of the Palestinian authority. I would also like to hear a view from the Council on the conduct of the United Kingdom and United States forces present in the area.\nAll our moral and political support goes to the President of the Palestinian Authority, who should have been among us here today. We are aware of his very difficult position, particularly after the result of the legislative elections in Palestine. As you said, Commissioner, Europe must remind the Israeli authorities of the need to respect the law and their legitimate partners, just as we demand of Hamas itself. Defying the legal framework means opening the door to the sort of retaliation and violence that is already going on and that we need to try and stem. We are relieved in this matter by news of the freeing of the hostages.\nAs for the crisis in Iran, another sorry chapter, I welcomed the words of Mr\u00a0Straw, which I hope he will hold to completely.

The figure of Mohammed is what we might call the point of communion for an Islam that is more fragile and diverse, and even more divided, than we might think. Targeting that figure means targeting its heart. There is no way we could not have known that, just as there is no way we could not have considered the consequences of what was being done, namely inflaming the conflict between civilisations. Who exactly do these cartoons serve: who has an interest in stirring up these conflicts? I would like to put that question. Certainly not us, the Europeans, surely not France anyway, which is the main Mediterranean coastal power and whose influence depends on a fine balance between its European continental policy, on the one hand, and its Mediterranean and African policy, on the other.\nAdmittedly, there comes with this statement a dual concern: on the one hand, the EMPA and Euromed are still like frail barques cast out to sea. Frail not just in terms of resources, but above all in terms of their intellectual inspiration, since it seems to me that they are still clinging to a very Eurocentric view of democracy and human rights \u2212 we have just seen yet another illustration of this \u2212 which not only smells of colonialism, but which furthermore prevents us \u2212 we saw this in December in Barcelona as well \u2212 from dealing with what is really important, that is to say, economic, financial and commercial cooperation and the management of migratory flows. Contrary to what the Commission has just said, I personally would talk about cooperation, rather than a free-trade area, which I believe to be a very dangerous formula.\nThe second concern is that the issue of civilisations has been an obvious one for a very long time, which we have known about since Charles Martel: we have not had to wait for American thinkers to point it out to us. One would have to be foolishly immersed in the delusions of globalisation to be all of a sudden amazed to discover that civilisations are not interchangeable and men even less so, and that coexistence between different peoples is not automatic. This kind of Huntington approach is clearly intended to send a different message, namely that we are all destined to be part of a \u2018West\u2019 \u2212 in emphatic inverted commas \u2212 the capital of which would have to be Washington, with the Europeans simply having to follow the warlike ventures of the United States. This very idea of the West is, as we know, an ideological sham.

However I wish to remain focused on our theme and I wish to talk as a member of the Economic Commission of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly. I wish that both the Commission as well as the Council analyse a study which was done by the University of Manchester entitled \u2018Sustainable Impact Assessment Study of the Euromed Free-Trade Area\u2019. We started to discuss this study in the Economic Commission of the Assembly and it gives a worrying picture of the impact of the European Union\u2019s policy on the setting up of a free trade area in the Mediterranean. It forecasts a rather negative effect on our partner countries in the Mediterranean who are supposed to benefit and not lose by the Barcelona Process. Among the negative effects it mentions the possibility that in these countries there could be an increase in unemployment, a decrease in the level of wages, as well as a great impact on resources such as water and biodiversity and other environmental impacts. Naturally the report is not telling us to halt or to dismantle the plan for the setting up of a free-trade area, but it is saying that we should take these negative effects seriously and we should take preventive measures now, before it is too late. Therefore I wish to ask both the Commission as well as the Council to tell us what is their opinion about this study and what measures they intend to take to address any negative impact which could be brought about by the setting up of a free trade area in the Mediterranean. For example there is the need, no doubt, that the European Union policy towards these countries should balance the commercial aspect with a more intensive cooperation in the financial, social and educational sector as well as in the environmental sector.

However I wish to remain focused on our theme and I wish to talk as a member of the Economic Commission of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly. I wish that both the Commission as well as the Council analyse a study which was done by the University of Manchester entitled \u2018Sustainable Impact Assessment Study of the Euromed Free-Trade Area\u2019. We started to discuss this study in the Economic Commission of the Assembly and it gives a worrying picture of the impact of the European Union\u2019s policy on the setting up of a free trade area in the Mediterranean. It forecasts a rather negative effect on our partner countries in the Mediterranean who are supposed to benefit and not lose by the Barcelona Process. Among the negative effects it mentions the possibility that in these countries there could be an increase in unemployment, a decrease in the level of wages, as well as a great impact on resources such as water and biodiversity and other environmental impacts. Naturally the report is not telling us to halt or to dismantle the plan for the setting up of a free-trade area, but it is saying that we should take these negative effects seriously and we should take preventive measures now, before it is too late. Therefore I wish to ask both the Commission as well as the Council to tell us what is their opinion about this study and what measures they intend to take to address any negative impact which could be brought about by the setting up of a free trade area in the Mediterranean. For example there is the need, no doubt, that the European Union policy towards these countries should balance the commercial aspect with a more intensive cooperation in the financial, social and educational sector as well as in the environmental sector. I conclude by appealing to both the Commission as well as to the Council to take a more active part in the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly and also to reply to the questions put by the Members of Parliament.", "reconstructed_position": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to outline the main points or arguments made by Simon Busuttil based on the provided debate summary. First, I need to locate any mentions of Simon Busuttil in the summary.\n\nLooking through the sections, there's a part under \"Specific Policy Concerns\" that mentions Simon Busuttil. The summary states: \"Simon Busuttil raised concerns about the University of Manchester study showing negative impacts of the proposed free trade area, warning that 'It forecasts a rather negative effect on our partner countries in the Mediterranean who are supposed to benefit and not lose by the Barcelona Process' [Busuttil, 2006-03-15].\"\n\nSo, the key point here is that Simon Busuttil is concerned about the negative effects of the free trade area on Mediterranean partner countries. He references a study from the University of Manchester that predicts these negative impacts. His argument is that the Barcelona Process, which aims to benefit these countries, might actually harm them instead. \n\nI need to make sure there are no other mentions of Busuttil elsewhere in the summary. Scanning through the other sections like \"Institutional Leadership Positions,\" \"Parliamentary Group Perspectives,\" etc., I don't see any other contributions from him. The rest of the summary talks about other speakers like Hans Winkler, Benita Ferrero-Waldner, Edward McMillan-Scott, etc., but not Busuttil. \n\nTherefore, the only argument attributed to Simon Busuttil is his concern about the University of Manchester study's findings regarding the free trade area's negative impacts on Mediterranean countries. There's no other information about his other potential arguments in this summary. The user's instruction is to only include points from the specified speaker, so I shouldn't add anything else. \n\nI should present this as the single main point.

I believe that, with a view to the meeting on the 26th and the 27th, we need to do four things: speed up decision making, refocus the debates around rapporteurs by committee, ensure that the Commission and Council attend and participate, as President Borrell demanded this morning at the beginning of our sitting, as events require, and finally to involve civil society.\nIn that way, we will be moving in the right direction.", "lang": "ES", "original": "Carlos Carnero Gonz\u00e1lez (PSE). \u2013 (ES) Se\u00f1or Presidente, perm\u00edtame, en primer lugar, que agradezca su presencia aqu\u00ed y, sobre todo, que le felicite por haber llevado con buen tino los trabajos de la Asamblea Parlamentaria Euromediterr\u00e1nea durante doce meses, el tiempo en el que a esta Casa le ha correspondido encabezar sus labores.\nDebemos ser capaces de reconocer lo que hacemos bien y tambi\u00e9n lo que hacemos mal.

Economic prosperity and social progress are not within everyone\u2019s reach, which means that issues of violence are very visible.\nWe already know that those denied healthcare and the right to acquire qualitative and quantitative knowledge tend to be our partners in the southern Mediterranean and in particular the least privileged sections of society, that is, women and the poor.\nThe future scenario concerns us. This is particularly the case if we assess the impact on sustainability of the Euro-Mediterranean free trade zone, which we want to see up and running by 2010, as the Commissioner pointed out. In this case, the data shows that in terms of reducing poverty, the immediate gains are considerably lower, although other benefits may accrue from the far-reaching changes taking place in the economies of our Mediterranean partners. In the areas of health and education, there is little chance of any short-term gains. Accordingly, with nothing to hold back this effect, it is likely that we will see health and education being adversely affected.\nAs regards human rights, it is vital that we look into the near-total absence of a guiding concept in the EU and the Euro-Mediterranean institutions on the issue of economic and social rights and the part that this plays in the Barcelona process.\nI feel that in the current framework in particular \u2013 albeit, in reality, across the board \u2013 this is a vitally important question, which should be given due prominence in the MEDA programme.\nOur most pressing priorities in this partnership should be to step up social dialogue, the fight against child labour, cooperation in combating discrimination in the field of social security, dialogue on social reforms and promoting equal opportunities between men and women.\nIn the context of today's reality, this issue should be brought to the fore in the Barcelona process.", "reconstructed_position": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out the main points that Jamila Madeira (PSE) made in the debate.

The summary has a section titled \"Specific Policy Concerns\" where it mentions her. Let me check that part.\n\nUnder \"Specific Policy Concerns,\" there's a mention of Jamila Madeira: \"Jamila Madeira emphasized social dimensions, arguing that 'Economic prosperity and social progress are not within everyone's reach, which means that issues of violence are very visible' [Madeira, 2006-03-15].\" \n\nSo her main argument here is about the social dimensions of the Euro-Mediterranean policy. She's pointing out that even if there's economic growth, not everyone benefits equally. This lack of equal access leads to visible issues like violence. \n\nI need to make sure there are no other mentions of her in other sections. Let me scan through the rest of the summary. \n\nLooking at the \"Institutional Leadership Positions,\" \"Parliamentary Group Perspectives,\" \"Dialogue and Cultural Issues,\" \"Palestinian Representation and Assembly Function,\" and \"Institutional Strengthening\" sections, I don't see any other quotes or references to Jamila Madeira. \n\nTherefore, the only point attributed to her is the one about social dimensions and the link between economic prosperity not being accessible to all leading to violence. The user wants the main points or arguments made by her, and since there's only one, that's the one to include. \n\nI should present it clearly, using her exact quote and explaining the argument.

We would be deceiving ourselves if we were to believe that this Partnership alone would be sufficient to enable us to make changes in a short space of time, but we must work at it, and, as the Commissioner said, the instruments to do so are available.\nThe human rights issue has been mentioned many times.
