Respect for the religious values and identity of others, such as Muslim fellow European citizens, is a European value and only stupidity cannot understand it, but in Europe we are obliged to defend even the right of stupidity to express itself freely, and our Arab partners must understand it.\nOn the issue of migration, the new initiatives by the Commission and the recent decisions by the Council to manage migratory flows instead of talking only about illegal immigration are commendable. Policies such as the well-anticipated and organised legal reception of migrants needed in the domestic markets, the establishment of brain circulation as opposed to a brain drain, facilitation of remittances, civic integration of migrants, the single asylum policy and so forth will be more appealing to our Mediterranean partners.\nIt is true that some of these countries have changed from countries of origin or transit to terminals. That is why we need to work together, by sharing technical means, expertise and responsibility, to fight the trafficking of human beings and illegal immigration.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Ioannis Kasoulides (PPE-DE). \u2013 Mr President, the Jericho events have been long debated by colleagues, this morning and later, but in the Committee on Quality of Life, Exchanges between Civil Societies and Culture the issue of the cartoons will certainly come up.\nWe must be unequivocal in condemning the content of the cartoons.
