Nowadays in Iran we are seeing the worst phase of the theocratic regime: executions are continuing, human rights are at their worst in Iranian history; the mixture of religion and politics is heavier than in any other part of the world and the government is mobilising its own people and other peoples in the Middle East against democracy.\nI think everybody accepts that developing nuclear power and nuclear weapons in Iran would be dangerous for the whole region. For that reason, I agree that we must act carefully when we speak about nuclear power in the region, because we could give the Iranian regime the ideal excuse to continue with its nuclear programme. Iranian leaders could be tempted to say that if Israel does not stop its nuclear programme, then Iran has the right to develop its own.\nWe have to be aware of the fact that when we are taking about the Iranian regime we are also talking about Syria and Lebanon, the future of the peace process in Israel and Palestine, theocracy and democracy, human rights and universal values.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Bernat Joan i Mar\u00ed (Verts/ALE). \u2013 Mr President, it appears that our strategy against the Iranian regime has largely failed.
