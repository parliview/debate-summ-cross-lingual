Dealing with Iran has been made all the harder by the Iraq war, which was not just a disaster but could turn out to be an act of geopolitical folly. The Iranian regime cannot be allowed to develop nuclear weapons. It is a religious fundamentalist, barbaric, pro-terrorist and anti-Semitic regime.\nThe world became used to the nuclear stand-off between the democratic west and the communist east during the Cold War, but in that confrontation, disaster was avoided because ultimately both sides were rational. The religious fundamentalists of Iran are not rational. An Iranian nuclear device could turn out to be the biggest suicide bomb the world has ever seen. In this situation all the options are dangerous but the most dangerous option is doing nothing at all.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Gerard Batten (IND/DEM). \u2013 Mr President, it is estimated that Iran could have nuclear weapons within three to ten years, although the point of no return in stopping that development could be reached much sooner.
