{"speaker": "Franco Frattini,", "english": "Franco Frattini, Vice-President of the Commission . (IT) Mr\u00a0President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that a crucial point is that, in the international community, and obviously in our Europe, there cannot and must not be any divisions where tackling relations with Iran is concerned.\nIran has exceeded many limits with regard to its uranium enrichment activities, its systematic violations of the dignity of women, men and, above all, children, and its support for what we rightly define as terrorist organisations. Nevertheless, there is still an opportunity for dialogue and for a diplomatic solution.\nAs many Members have said \u2013 and I recall Mr\u00a0Schulz\u2019s remarks \u2013 Iran and Islam are not the same thing. What is needed, therefore, is a regional dialogue aimed at securing stability and peace, one that primarily involves Iran, but also all the other actors in the region that are interested in a serious dialogue with the international community.\nIran and President Ahmadinejad are not the same, either. Many Members have said so, the last of whom being Mrs\u00a0B\u011bnov\u00e1. It is clear that Europe can carry out political action through dialogue with civil society and the moderate forces in Iran that are fighting for freedom, that want to think for themselves and be free to choose their own destiny, and that do not trust the remarks of their President, which are designed to incite hatred and violence.\nWhat are the options for the future? I believe that the Security Council must now show evidence of its credibility and authority. Those in this Chamber who questioned the role played by the Security Council are indirectly questioning the role that we all assign to it. The Security Council represents the home of international legitimacy. No one should be afraid that the Security Council will hold an extensive and in-depth debate on the Iranian crisis, since it is precisely the forum to which such a matter must be brought. We have appealed to the Security Council on many occasions. The time has now come to give the Security Council the opportunity to really play its due role.\nMr\u00a0President, Europe is faced with the choice between, on the one hand, working to achieve peace and regional stability \u2013 as I believe is our duty \u2013 and, on the other, pretending that nothing is going on, with the danger of an aggressive nuclear power arising in the region.\nEurope has a great opportunity to exercise diplomacy and to show determination. Before we talk even only vaguely about any non-peaceful option, I believe that it is better that we emphasise democracy, determination and diplomacy as instruments for resolving the conflicts and the potential violence that we must do everything possible to avoid.\nIt is not a conflict that is under way, but a different approach to rights, values and democracy. If we surround Iran with democracy and diplomacy, then we will be able to avert catastrophic consequences.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Franco Frattini, Vice-President of the Commission .
