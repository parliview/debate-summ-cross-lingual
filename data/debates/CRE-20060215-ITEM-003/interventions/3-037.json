{"speaker": "Lilli Gruber (PSE). \u2013", "english": "Lilli Gruber (PSE). \u2013 Mr President, I would like to remind Members of certain fundamental mistakes made by many people during the Iraq affair when assessing the intentions of Saddam\u2019s regime regarding weapons of mass destruction. Intelligence, then and today, is largely inconclusive, if not misleading. It is based largely on inferences and is often lacking in hard data. The best intelligence agencies today do not have a single reliable source in Iran capable of providing information on Tehran\u2019s intentions and capabilities.\nWhile it may not be perfect, the IAEA is the only means of monitoring any nuclear programme in Iran. Between 1991 and 1998, and despite Saddam\u2019s best efforts from 1992 onwards, the IAEA could not declare Iraq free of weapons of mass destruction. So let us avoid making further costly mistakes based on confusing mistrust with well-founded suspicion. This is what warmongering politicians are trying to instil in our minds, and it is simply illogical.\nOne of the lessons we should learn from the Iraq nuclear case is very simple: it was the bombing of the Osirak reactor in 1981 that led Saddam to decide to have a serious nuclear programme. I can easily imagine what disasters could result from a so-called \u2018surgical strike\u2019 of this kind today.\nWe have the time to negotiate, we have solid political and legal grounds to request that Iran comply fully with the NPT and there is a political and social opposition in Iran that is far from toothless, but, if we want to create the conditions for security and stability in the Middle East, we, as Europeans, must make it clear to all sides that international rights and obligations are the same for everyone.\nThis also means that our American friends must change the political paradigm with Iran, acknowledging that their past approaches have been ineffective and that they need to adopt a more collaborative policy in order to safeguard everybody\u2019s interests in this crucial part of the world.\n(Applause)", "lang": "EN", "original": "Lilli Gruber (PSE). \u2013 Mr President, I would like to remind Members of certain fundamental mistakes made by many people during the Iraq affair when assessing the intentions of Saddam\u2019s regime regarding weapons of mass destruction.
