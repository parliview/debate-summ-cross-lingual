Over recent years, the EU has spared no effort to find a solution by negotiation and to urge Iran to adopt confidence-building measures with regard to its nuclear programme. Iran has been moving in the wrong direction recently by taking unilateral action, most recently resuming uranium-enrichment activities at Natanz and suspending application of the IAEA Additional Protocol.\nThe adoption by the IAEA Board of Governors of its resolution of 4\u00a0February bringing the matter to the attention of the Security Council of the United Nations gave a clear signal to Iran. The large majority by which the resolution was adopted demonstrates that Europe\u2019s deep concern about Iran\u2019s nuclear programme is shared by the international community as a whole.\nThe EU is by no means calling into question Iran\u2019s right to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. The cause of this conflict lies in Iran\u2019s failure to take sufficient action to date to build the necessary confidence in the peaceful nature of its nuclear programme. On the contrary, over the last 18\u00a0years, Iran has failed to declare a substantial part of its very extensive nuclear programme to the IAEA, and is still refusing to provide it with important information concerning, in particular, the extent of development of its uranium-enrichment technology and the field of \u2018weaponisation\u2019 \u2013 that is, the militarisation of its nuclear programme.\nThe EU\u2019s objective is still to achieve a solution to the matter by negotiation. Yet this requires that Iran show sufficient willingness to be cooperative and open, in particular towards the IAEA, and to take urgently needed confidence-building measures such as suspending sensitive nuclear activities. The Russian proposal to build a Russian-Iranian uranium-enrichment facility on Russian soil as an alternative to enrichment in Iran is an important contribution and has the full support of the EU.\nLet me reiterate quite clearly that the EU remains committed to a diplomatic solution to the Iranian nuclear issue, in which the IAEA must play a key role. Involving the Security Council is not tantamount to diminishing the role of the IAEA, but rather is intended to strengthen the IAEA\u2019s authority and make it possible to implement the measures required by the resolutions of its Board of Governors.\nOn the subject of relations between the EU and Iran, the EU still regards the human-rights situation in Iran with great concern. The situation is worsening, and the Iranian authorities are not taking any tangible action to reform legislation or official practices. Despite repeated requests by the EU, Iran has failed to make any further commitment to resuming the stalled human-rights dialogue. The EU will continue to voice its human-rights concerns, both directly to the Iranian Government and in public statements and international forums.\nThe statements made by the Iranian President on Israel have been unambiguously and strongly condemned by the EU and the international community as a whole. Iran\u2019s position on the Middle East gives grounds for grave concern. It still supports Palestinian groups that the EU classifies as terrorist organisations. We note with concern that the Iranian President recently met some of the leaders of such groups in Syria, and we call on Iran to end such contacts. In addition, we call for it to join the international consensus on the necessity of a two-state solution to the Middle East conflict.\nThe repeated attempts by the Iranian President to deny the crimes of the Holocaust, and his calls for the state of Israel to be \u2018wiped off the map\u2019, are to be firmly rejected. Statements such as this are completely unacceptable and, furthermore, are totally at odds with the efforts of the numerous political and religious leaders who are specifically working on all sides to promote a dialogue between the cultures that is characterised by mutual respect, particularly following the events of recent days.\nThe EU\u2019s relations with Iran will depend on progress made on all of the issues of concern: the nuclear issue and other concerns in connection with weapons of mass destruction, human rights, the fight against terrorism and the country\u2019s position on the Middle East. The options for action by the EU will be kept under close review and weighed up in the light of Iran\u2019s declarations and actions.\nOn the subject of the violence: as has been clearly underlined in the debate in this House, the attacks on bodies of the European Union are in no way justifiable, and are completely unacceptable. The EU Presidency has condemned these attacks and called on Iran to meet its obligations with regard to the protection laid down in the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961. In accordance with these obligations, the Presidency has also reminded Iran that responsibility under international law for ensuring compliance with these obligations lies with the state.\n(Applause)", "lang": "DE", "original": "Hans Winkler, amtierender Ratspr\u00e4sident .

Die Ursache dieses Konfliktes ist darin zu suchen, dass der Iran bis zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt nicht genug unternommen hat, um das notwendige Vertrauen in den friedlichen Charakter seines Atomprogramms zu schaffen. Im Gegenteil, der Iran hat im Laufe der letzten 18\u00a0Jahre einen wesentlichen Bestandteil seines sehr umfangreichen Atomprogramms nicht der IAEA deklariert und verweigert der IAEA bis zum heutigen Tage wichtige Informationen.

Die Befassung des Sicherheitsrates ist nicht gleichbedeutend mit einer Schm\u00e4lerung der Rolle der IAEA, sondern soll vielmehr die Autorit\u00e4t der IAEA st\u00e4rken und eine Umsetzung der in den Resolutionen des IAEA Gouverneursrates geforderten Ma\u00dfnahmen erm\u00f6glichen.\nZu den Beziehungen EU-Iran: Die EU betrachtet die Menschenrechtslage in Iran weiterhin mit gro\u00dfer Sorge.

Mr President, it is clear that Iran needs to take visible and credible steps back in order to regain the confidence of the international community. For the past few months the nuclear file has been at the centre of EU concerns with Iran, and rightly so. The region does not need further tension and prospects of nuclear escalation. Despite the persistent efforts for dialogue of the so-called EU-3 and of other international partners, Iran has not engaged in a convincing way.

The user wants me to outline the main points or arguments made by Franco Frattini based on the provided debate summary. First, I need to go through the summary and find all the parts where Franco Frattini is mentioned.\n\nLooking at the summary, there's a section titled \"Nuclear Program and International Response\" where Franco Frattini is mentioned. The quote given is: \"The EU's objective is still to achieve a solution to the matter by negotiation. Yet this requires that Iran show sufficient willingness to be cooperative and open, in particular towards the IAEA\" [Winkler, 2006-02-15]. Wait, but the speaker here is Hans Winkler, not Frattini. Then in the same section, there's another mention: \"Franco Frattini highlighted that 'Iran executed more child offenders in 2005 than in any recent year'\" [Frattini, 2006-02-15]. So that's Frattini's point about human rights. \n\nAlso, in the \"Broader Strategic Considerations\" section, there's a quote from Frattini: \"we must remember firstly that it is Europe that has sold this nuclear technology to Iran\" [Gollnisch, 2006-02-15]. Wait, no, that's Bruno Gollnisch. So maybe I need to check again. \n\nLooking again, under \"Human Rights and Regional Context,\" the quote is from Frattini: \"Iran executed more child offenders in 2005 than in any recent year\" [Frattini, 2006-02-15]. Then, in the \"Conclusion\" section, Frattini's quote is: \"If we surround Iran with democracy and diplomacy, then we will be able to avert catastrophic consequences\" [Frattini, 2006-02-15]. \n\nSo the main points attributed to Frattini are:\n1. Emphasizing the EU's goal of negotiation but requiring Iran's cooperation with the IAEA.\n2. Highlighting Iran's human rights issues, specifically the number of child offenders executed.\n3. Advocating for surrounding Iran with democracy and diplomacy to prevent catastrophe.\n\nWait, but the first point mentions Hans Winkler, not Frattini. The user is asking about Franco Frattini. So I need to make sure that the points are correctly attributed. The first quote in the Nuclear Program section is from Winkler, not Frattini. Then Frattini's contributions are in the Human Rights section and the Conclusion. \n\nSo the main arguments from Frattini are:\n- Mentioning the high number of child offenders executed in Iran.\n- Supporting diplomatic solutions and the role of the EU in promoting democracy and diplomacy to avoid catastrophe.\n\nI should also check if there are any other mentions. In the \"Broader Strategic Considerations\" section, there's a quote from Gollnisch and Karatzaferis, but not Frattini. So the only points are the two mentioned. \n\nTherefore, the answer should list these two points. The user said to only include points attributed to the speaker, so no other contributions. Also, if there are none, return an empty string. But here there are two points.\n</think>\n\nFranco Frattini's contributions focused on two key areas:  \n1. **Human Rights Concerns:** He highlighted Iran's severe human rights record, specifically noting that \"Iran executed more child offenders in 2005 than in any recent year.\"  \n2. **Diplomatic Solutions:** He emphasized the need for diplomatic engagement, concluding that \"if we surround Iran with democracy and diplomacy, then we will be able to avert catastrophic consequences.\"", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Michael Gahler,", "english": "Michael Gahler, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . \u2013 (DE) Mr\u00a0President, on behalf of the Group of the European People\u2019s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I should like to declare our full support for the policy of the international community on Iran, as revealed in the resolution of the IAEA Board of Governors of 4\u00a0February, the position of the EU General Affairs Council of 30\u00a0January, and the statement issued by the EU-3 together with the USA, Russia and China in London.\nIn the government of my home country, too, Chancellor\u00a0Merkel and Minister for Foreign Affairs Steinmeier are together resolutely following this course. It must be made clear to Iran\u2019s leaders that they cannot create divisions within the international community, nor \u2013 naturally \u2013 within the individual bodies of the EU. Parliament\u2019s resolution today will make that clear.\nWe recognise the fundamental right of all parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to use nuclear energy for peaceful, civil purposes; but Iran has crossed so many red lines that confidence in the regime\u2019s honourable intentions has faded. Neither its reduced cooperation with the IAEA, its President\u2019s threat that Iran would leave the Non-Proliferation Treaty, its postponement of the talks with Russia that had been scheduled for this Thursday nor, in particular, its resumption of uranium enrichment, are conducive to building confidence and defusing the situation.\nThis makes it all the more important to continue to present a resolute, united front to Iran. Anything that could now be conducive to giving Tehran the impression of division or compliance is unhelpful. Those who believe that our unconditional desire for peace alone will induce our opposite numbers to change course and see the light are doing our natural yearning for peace a disservice. Particularly when our counterparts are preaching hatred and hostility, and deliberately acting contrary to the expectations of the international community, we should not disclose to the other side everything that we might do as a consequence of their actions.\nI do not believe that the scope for diplomatic efforts has yet been exhausted. We are offering constructive cooperation. We are calling on Iran to resume cooperation with the IAEA before the issue is discussed in the Security Council.

Die Einschr\u00e4nkung der Kooperation mit der IAEA, die Drohung des iranischen Pr\u00e4sidenten mit dem Ausstieg aus dem Atomwaffensperrvertrag, die Verschiebung der f\u00fcr diesen Donnerstag geplanten Gespr\u00e4che mit Russland und vor allem die Wiederaufnahme der Urananreichung sind alle nicht geeignet, Vertrauen zu bilden und die Situation zu entspannen.\nUmso mehr gilt es, gegen\u00fcber dem Iran weiterhin geschlossen und entschlossen aufzutreten. Alles was jetzt dazu beitragen k\u00f6nnte, Teheran den Eindruck von Uneinigkeit und Nachgiebigkeit zu vermitteln, ist wenig hilfreich. Der nat\u00fcrlichen Friedenssehnsucht unserer Menschen leisten diejenigen keinen guten Dienst, die glauben, dass unser unbedingter Friedenswille allein auf der anderen Seite schon zur Umkehr und Einsicht f\u00fchrt. Gerade wenn Hass und Feindseligkeit auf der anderen Seite gepredigt werden und vors\u00e4tzlich gegen die internationalen Erwartungen gehandelt wird, sollten wir der anderen Seite gegen\u00fcber nicht alles offen legen, was Konsequenz ihres Handelns von unserer Seite sein k\u00f6nnte.\nAus meiner Sicht ist das Ende diplomatischer Bem\u00fchungen noch nicht erreicht. Wir bieten eine konstruktive Zusammenarbeit an. Wir fordern den Iran auf, zur Zusammenarbeit mit der IAEA zur\u00fcckzukehren, vor Behandlung des Themas im Weltsicherheitsrat. Wir unterst\u00fctzen auch das Angebot Russlands, die Anreicherung des Urans f\u00fcr zivile Zwecke au\u00dferhalb Irans vorzunehmen. Wir fragen uns, warum Iran die eigene Anreicherung will.

However, I should also like to ask the House to reflect on what is more important: having time for a proper debate, or Members of this House complaining when a vote is taken. I should have liked to hear Mr\u00a0Gahler out, as what he was saying was most fascinating. Indeed, the question he raised is one of the ones that preoccupies us most at the present time.\nHow do we deal with a regime that is quite blatantly pushing all its boundaries? How do we respond to that as an international community? In my speech I shall try to add some further questions from the point of view of my group. It is not necessary to comment in this House on the remarks made by the Iranian President. A Head of State who denies the Holocaust, and who calls into question Israel\u2019s right to exist, is not a fitting dialogue partner for us.\nAll the values that President Ahmadinejad stands for are the opposite of those we stand for, and I should welcome a debate on values with these people. We have already had a debate on values this morning; and that was good \u2013 it was a serious, considered debate. We should hold a calm, self-confident debate, and see whether there are others in the region besides President Ahmadinejad with whom we can hold dialogue. We should reflect on options open to us before we philosophise about options closing.\nAre there not sufficient moderate countries in the region who are open to dialogue and with whom we can cooperate, who may not share our values one-to-one, but to whose interests it is also entirely detrimental to have Iran become a leading nuclear power in the region? Yes, there are, and, in my view, they are suitable dialogue partners for the EU. In this connection, of course, the conflict over the caricatures not only comes at the worst possible time, but is even counterproductive in the extreme, for these are the very countries with whom we need a relationship of mutual respect. Solving this caricature conflict is also central to solving the problems of the region as a whole, therefore.\nFor this reason, I would advise against equating \u2018Iran\u2019 and \u2018Islam\u2019. The actions of one aggressive Head of State of one country do not in any way reflect the views of the vast majority of peace-loving Muslims around the world, with whom we have to cooperate.\nI think it is right that all enrichment activities \u2013 that is, those by all countries \u2013 should be under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency, as proposed by the IAEA itself. We should support this proposal. I also think, incidentally, that it is perfectly justifiable to refresh memories and say that the debate on nuclear disarmament should not be limited to this region: it needs to be universal. In this connection, allow me to point out that treating countries who already have nuclear weapons differently from those who are on the way to having them, and carrying out pre-emptive strikes against countries who did not have any weapons of mass destruction, only encourages regimes to procure nuclear weapons as quickly and illegally as possible, because those who own them will not be attacked. This is a logic that also needs to be discussed, one that was triggered by a pre-emptive strike carried out in the same region in the past, which was utterly wrong and which we vehemently opposed.\nI believe that the logic behind this was extremely dangerous, and that is why we have to abandon this strategy of goal-based thinking, as it leads to the militarisation of thought. We must reinforce our diplomatic options step by step. It was an enormous accomplishment on the part of the EU-3 to bring China and Russia together and thus give Iran a clear signal that the international community will not allow itself to be divided. Let us talk about diplomatic successes instead of philosophising about military options. The international community should do everything in its power to make it clear to Iran that failure to return to the negotiating table by 6\u00a0March will automatically trigger a referral to the Security Council. Subsequent action should then be decided there, however, rather than by just any central government.\n(Applause)", "lang": "DE", "original": "Martin Schulz, im Namen der PSE-Fraktion . \u2013 Herr Pr\u00e4sident!

On the other hand, the whole Persian atomic programme shows every sign of that country secretly seeking to possess a nuclear weapons capability, hence the cat and mouse game that Teheran has, for years, played with the Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna.\nI ask the Council and the Commission: where do we go from here? Whatever you do, I urge you to stand for no more nonsense from the mullahs, in short, to keep all your options open against a terrorist regime that so far has only played for time and wishes to drive a wedge between the European Union and the US, and Israel, respectively.

Let me check again. The speaker name given is \"Konrad Szyma\u0144ski,\" but in the summary, there's a mention of \"Libor Rou\u010dek\" in the Proposed Solutions section. Could there be a mix-up? Or perhaps the name is spelled differently?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the speaker's name.

Let me start by reading through the debate summary again to locate any mentions of him.\n\nLooking at the section on \"Military Options Debate,\" there's a mention of Charles Tannock (PPE-DE) arguing for keeping all options open. The exact quote is: \"I agree with all those who say that all options must be left available to the West to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran\" [Tannock, 2006-02-15]. \n\nSo, the key point here is that Tannock supported keeping military options on the table. The summary also mentions that he was part of the group that advocated for this, while others like Angelika Beer opposed military approaches. Since the user specified that I should only include points attributed to the speaker in question, and there's only one quote here, I need to make sure there's no other information about Tannock elsewhere in the summary.\n\nChecking the rest of the summary, there's a mention of Michael Gahler and Martin Schulz, but not Tannock. The other sections like \"Human Rights and Regional Context\" or \"Broader Strategic Considerations\" don't reference him. So, the only argument attributed to Tannock is his statement about keeping all options open, including military ones, to prevent Iran from becoming nuclear-armed.\n\nI should present this as the main point. The user wants the response to be an empty string if there are no points, but here there is one. So the answer should be the quote and the argument he made. But the user also says to outline the main points or arguments, so maybe paraphrase it. However, the example given in the problem uses the exact quote. Wait, the user says \"outline the main points or arguments made by that speaker.\" So perhaps just stating his position without the quote, but the example in the problem includes the quote. Let me check the original instructions again.\n\nThe user says: \"You will outline the main points or arguments made by that speaker.\" So it's okay to include the quote if it's part of the argument. But maybe the user wants a summary. However, the example provided in the problem (the one with the empty string) might have different cases. But in this case, the only contribution from Tannock is the quote about keeping all options open. So the answer should be that he argued for keeping all options available, including military, to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran. But since the user might want the exact quote, perhaps include it. However, the user's instruction says \"outline the main points or arguments,\" so perhaps paraphrase. However, the example given in the problem's initial message (the one with the empty string) might not have any, but in this case, there is one. \n\nSo the final answer should be the statement that Charles Tannock supported keeping all options open, including military, to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. The exact quote is part of the argument, so maybe include it as per the example. But the user might prefer a concise summary. Let me check the original problem's example. The user says, \"If this is the case, respond with an empty string.\" So if there are points, list them. The user might expect the exact quote or a paraphrase. Since the user provided the example with the quote, perhaps it's better to include the exact quote as part of the argument. However, the instruction says \"outline the main points or arguments,\" which could be paraphrased. But given that the user included the quote in the debate summary, maybe the answer should include it. However, the user might want the answer to be in the assistant's own words. But the initial example in the problem's setup isn't visible, so I need to follow the user's instructions. \n\nIn any case, based on the given summary, the only argument from Tannock is the one about keeping all options open. So the answer should be that he argued for maintaining military options to prevent Iran from becoming nuclear-armed. The exact quote is part of the debate summary, but the user might want the main point. So the final answer is: Charles Tannock (PPE-DE) argued that all options, including military ones, should be kept available to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.\n</think>\n\nCharles Tannock (PPE-DE) argued that \"all options must be left available to the West to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran\" [Tannock, 2006-02-15], advocating for the retention of military options as a necessary measure to address Iran's nuclear ambitions.", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Lilli Gruber (PSE). \u2013", "english": "Lilli Gruber (PSE). \u2013 Mr President, I would like to remind Members of certain fundamental mistakes made by many people during the Iraq affair when assessing the intentions of Saddam\u2019s regime regarding weapons of mass destruction.

Let me look through the summary provided.\n\nThe user mentioned that the debate was about Iran's confrontation with the international community, focusing on the nuclear program, human rights, and diplomatic responses. The executive summary has several sections. \n\nLooking at the \"Broader Strategic Considerations\" section, there's a mention of Bruno Gollnisch and Georgios Karatzaferis. The summary says: \"Bruno Gollnisch pointed out: 'we must remember firstly that it is Europe that has sold this nuclear technology to Iran' [Gollnisch, 2006-02-15], while Georgios Karatzaferis questioned: 'We want our allies to have nuclear weapons and no one else. That is intimidation and it is anti-democratic!' [Karatzaferis, 2006-02-15].\"\n\nSo Georgios Karatzaferis's argument is about Western double standards regarding nuclear weapons. He's criticizing the idea that allies can have nuclear weapons while others can't, calling it intimidation and anti-democratic. That's the only point attributed to him in the summary. The rest of the summary mentions other speakers, but for Karatzaferis, it's just that one quote. I need to make sure there's no other mention. Let me check again.\n\nIn the \"Human Rights and Regional Context\" section, there's a mention of Jana Hyb\u00e1\u0161kov\u00e1, but not Karatzaferis. The \"Proposed Solutions\" section doesn't mention him either. The conclusion also doesn't reference him. So the only argument from Karatzaferis is the one about double standards and the statement about allies having nuclear weapons. \n\nTherefore, the main point is his critique of Western hypocrisy regarding nuclear proliferation. He's pointing out that the West wants allies to have nukes but not others, which he sees as anti-democratic. That's the key argument here. No other points are attributed to him in the provided summary.\n</think>\n\nGeorgios Karatzaferis (IND/DEM) questioned Western double standards regarding nuclear weapons, stating: \"We want our allies to have nuclear weapons and no one else. That is intimidation and it is anti-democratic!\" [Karatzaferis, 2006-02-15].

Let us recall that at the end of last year, when the European Parliament\u2019s report on weapons of mass destruction was debated, it was precisely Iran\u2019s nuclear programme that triggered the most vigorous debates. The Members\u2019 call at that time for constructive action was shrugged off with the stance that only the path of negotiation would solve the Iranian problem. It is obvious, however, that tensions between Iran and the international community have only increased.\nLadies and gentlemen, recent months were a time for the consolidation of international action. Now, not just the International Atomic Energy Agency but all five permanent members of the UN Security Council unanimously acknowledge that Iran\u2019s nuclear programme is not of a peaceful nature.\nCertainly, it is not the European Parliament that will decide on the further course of events, but we must stress that the inability of the states to agree on joint action at the 2005 review conference of the NPT (Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons) only gave rise to an obsession among Iran\u2019s leadership.\nLadies and gentlemen, while the Iranian nuclear issues are considered at the UN Security Council, in this situation the European Parliament and national parliaments must again and again highlight the need for unity among the international community.

There are still strong doubts about the Iranians\u2019 claims that they only want to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.\nThe recent actions of Tehran, the removal of the seals placed by the International Atomic Energy Agency and the suspension of the voluntary implementation of the additional protocol on safeguards run counter to the statements of intent made by the Iranian Government and to our attempts to secure a negotiated settlement.\nOn the basis of all that, we conclude that Iran is presenting itself on the international stage as the leading authority of the Islamic revolt against the West, and that it therefore intends to assert its own military might over that of the other Muslim nations. For that reason, attacking and demonising Israel becomes a strategic move. Iran considers itself to be invincible and unassailable on the economic, industrial, financial and energy fronts, and we therefore fear that any negotiation is destined to fail.\nAs the delegation of the Forza Italia party, we therefore propose that the Iranian Minister for Foreign Affairs be invited to Brussels to take part in a meeting with our EU-Iran parliamentary delegation. We need to explain that it will not be possible to pursue a dialogue between our Parliament and the Iranian Government if the latter does not establish an equivalent parliamentary delegation.\nWe must therefore request an ongoing dialogue with all of the political forces in Iran, on both the ruling and the opposition sides, and show solidarity towards Israel with regard to the continual attacks it is under, by committing the European Union to guarantee security within the Middle East.

Rimangono tuttora forti dubbi sulle asserzioni iraniane di voler sviluppare l\u2019energia nucleare esclusivamente per scopi pacifici.\nLe recenti azioni di Teheran, la rottura dei sigilli apposti da parte dell\u2019Agenzia atomica e la sospensione dell\u2019applicazione volontaria del protocollo addizionale sulle salvaguardie sono di segno opposto rispetto alle dichiarazioni di intenti del governo del paese e ai nostri tentativi di trovare una soluzione negoziale.\nDa tutto ci\u00f2 desumiamo che l\u2019Iran si sta proponendo sul piano internazionale come l\u2019autorit\u00e0 guida della rivolta islamica contro l\u2019Occidente e intende quindi affermare la propria superiorit\u00e0 militare rispetto alle altre nazioni musulmane. Per questo motivo diventa strategico l\u2019attacco a Israele e la sua demonizzazione. L\u2019Iran si sente invincibile e inattaccabile sul piano economico, industriale, finanziario ed energetico, e temiamo quindi che qualsiasi negoziazione sia destinata a fallire.\nCome delegazione di Forza Italia proponiamo pertanto di invitare il ministro degli Affari esteri iraniano a Bruxelles per un incontro con la nostra delegazione parlamentare UE-Iran.

Today\u2019s Iran is potentially dangerous. Tomorrow\u2019s Iran, armed with nuclear weapons, is a definite danger.\nAgainst this backdrop, the citizens expect the EU to guarantee their security and to be a stabilising factor on the world stage.

We believe that the EU\u2019s first task should be to strive to maintain a cohesive and resolute response among the international community to the regional and global threat posed by Iran.\nWe must not allow the current difficulties and these politically sensitive times to lead to rifts, when what is at stake is something as fundamental as our global security. Iran needs to know that the diplomatic route remains open, but also that it is up to Iran to restore trust by means of practical, verifiable moves towards the total suspension of its uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities. It must also abandon its provocative rhetoric on Israel and the holocaust, and must commit itself to a policy, acceptable to the international community, of respect for human rights and for opposition parties.\nWhat appropriate, effective measures can be taken to achieve these goals? This is the key question to which we must respond.\nMr President, it is increasingly clear that the relevance of the EU\u2019s role on the international stage depends entirely on its deeds.

Let me go through the debate summary carefully.\n\nFirst, the user provided a detailed executive summary of a parliamentary debate from February 15, 2006, focusing on Iran's nuclear program, human rights, and diplomatic responses. The task is to outline the main points or arguments made by a specific speaker, in this case, Lu\u00eds Queir\u00f3 from the PPE-DE group. \n\nLooking through the summary, I see sections on different speakers. Let me check each part where speakers are mentioned. The summary mentions several contributors like Hans Winkler, Franco Frattini, Michael Gahler, Martin Schulz, Charles Tannock, Angelika Beer, Miguel Portas, Franco Frattini again, Jana Hyb\u00e1\u0161kov\u00e1, Monika Be\u0148ov\u00e1, Bruno Gollnisch, Georgios Karatzaferis, Libor Rou\u010dek, and others. However, when I scan through the entire summary, I don't see any mention of Lu\u00eds Queir\u00f3 (PPE-DE). \n\nThe user might have made a mistake, or perhaps Lu\u00eds Queir\u00f3 didn't make any contributions in this particular debate. The summary lists 30 substantive interventions, but none are attributed to Queir\u00f3. The names listed in the summary are different. For example, Michael Gahler is mentioned, but not Queir\u00f3. \n\nSince the instruction says that if there are no points attributed to the speaker, I should respond with an empty string. Therefore, based on the provided summary, there's no information about Lu\u00eds Queir\u00f3's contributions. I need to confirm that there's no mention of him anywhere in the text. Let me do a quick search for \"Queir\u00f3\" in the summary. \n\nLooking through the sections again: under \"Nuclear Program and International Response,\" \"Military Options Debate,\" \"Human Rights and Regional Context,\" \"Broader Strategic Considerations,\" and \"Proposed Solutions,\" there's no mention of Lu\u00eds Queir\u00f3. The speakers listed are different. \n\nTherefore, the correct response is an empty string because the summary doesn't attribute any arguments or contributions to Lu\u00eds Queir\u00f3 (PPE-DE).\n</think>\n\n\"", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Libor Rou\u010dek (PSE).", "english": "Libor Rou\u010dek (PSE). \u2013 (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, the word most often used in this morning\u2019s debates has been the word \u2018dialogue\u2019; dialogue between cultures, between civilisations and, I may say, even between the European Union and Iran.

That is an important point to emphasise. We believe that the Russian proposal to build a Russian-Iranian uranium-enrichment facility on Russian soil would be a good alternative to enrichment in Iran: this solution has the full support of the EU. Some have said that Austria should take the initiative, but I am, of course, speaking here in my capacity as representative of the Council, and as such I represent the position held by the Council as a whole, irrespective of any national positions.\nHowever, as many speakers have mentioned \u2013 for which I am grateful \u2013 it is also important to bear in mind that the issue of Iran\u2019s nuclear programme is not the only one that is important and fundamental to our relationship with that country, and which must be resolved if we are to improve our relations with its Government, with its President. There is also the human-rights issue. I should like to remind the House that, since 1975, Iran has been a party, without reservation, to both the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the UN International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights. Iran therefore has a clear obligation under international law to comply with the requirements of these important agreements.\nFinally, I should like to confirm that I share the opinion expressed by Mr\u00a0Brok and others that we must of course continue the dialogue with the forces in Iran who are favourably disposed to peaceful coexistence and to compliance with the country\u2019s obligations. We intend to do so; of course we are willing to engage in dialogue. It must be made quite clear, however, that we must not allow this dialogue to be abused, and so we have to be very careful in our choice of dialogue partners.

In der Tat sind Zweifel an der Friedfertigkeit dieses Atomprogramms angebracht.\nIch m\u00f6chte aber noch einmal betonen \u2013 und das wurde von vielen Rednern hier angesprochen \u2013, dass die Europ\u00e4ische Union einer diplomatischen L\u00f6sung der iranischen Atomfrage im Rahmen des Multilateralismus, insbesondere im Rahmen der internationalen Atomenergieorganisation verpflichtet bleibt. Das ist wichtig, zu betonen. Wir glauben, dass der russische Vorschlag zum Aufbau einer russisch-iranischen Urananreicherungskapazit\u00e4t auf russischem Boden eine gute Alternative zur Anreicherung im Iran w\u00e4re. Diese L\u00f6sung wird von der Europ\u00e4ischen Union voll und ganz unterst\u00fctzt. Es wurde angesprochen, dass \u00d6sterreich Initiativen setzen soll. Ich spreche hier selbstverst\u00e4ndlich als Vertreter des Rates, und als solcher vertrete ich hier eine Position, die der Rat insgesamt \u2013 unabh\u00e4ngig von allf\u00e4lligen nationalen Positionen \u2013 verfolgt.\nEs ist aber auch wichtig \u2013 und das wurde von vielen Rednern angesprochen, und daf\u00fcr bin ich dankbar \u2013, dass die Frage des Atomprogramms nicht die einzige Frage ist, die in unserem Verh\u00e4ltnis zum Iran wichtig und wesentlich ist und die gel\u00f6st werden muss, wenn wir bessere Beziehungen zu dieser Regierung, zu diesem Staatspr\u00e4sidenten, haben wollen. Das ist die Frage der Menschenrechte. Ich darf daran erinnern, dass der Iran seit 1975 ohne Vorbehalte Vertragspartei der beiden UN-Pakte \u00fcber zivile b\u00fcrgerliche und politische Rechte und \u00fcber wirtschaftliche und soziale Rechte ist. Es besteht also eine klare v\u00f6lkerrechtliche Verpflichtung f\u00fcr den Iran, die in diesen wichtigen Vertragsinstrumenten enthaltenen Verpflichtungen zu erf\u00fcllen.\nSchlie\u00dflich darf ich best\u00e4tigen, dass auch ich der Meinung bin, die Herr Brok und andere Redner ge\u00e4u\u00dfert haben, dass selbstverst\u00e4ndlich der Dialog mit jenen Kr\u00e4ften im Iran fortgesetzt werden muss, die f\u00fcr ein friedliches Zusammenleben und f\u00fcr eine Einhaltung der Verpflichtungen sind. Diesen Dialog wollen wir weiterf\u00fchren. Wir sind selbstverst\u00e4ndlich dialogbereit. Allerdings \u2013 und das m\u00fcssen wir in aller Klarheit sagen \u2013 d\u00fcrfen wir nicht zulassen, dass dieser Dialog missbraucht wird. Daher m\u00fcssen wir sehr genau darauf achten, mit wem wir diesen Dialog f\u00fchren. Mir erscheint hier auch die Frage der F\u00f6rderung der Zivilgesellschaft im Iran von besonderer Wichtigkeit zu sein.\n(Beifall)", "reconstructed_position": "<think>\nOkay, let's see.

The user wants me to outline the main points or arguments made by Franco Frattini based on the provided debate summary. First, I need to go through the summary and find all the parts where Franco Frattini is mentioned.\n\nLooking at the summary, there's a section under \"Nuclear Program and International Response\" where Franco Frattini is mentioned. The quote is: \"The EU's objective is still to achieve a solution to the matter by negotiation. Yet this requires that Iran show sufficient willingness to be cooperative and open, in particular towards the IAEA\" [Winkler, 2006-02-15]. Wait, but the speaker here is Hans Winkler, not Frattini. Then, in the same section, there's another mention: \"Council and Commission Position: Hans Winkler (Council President) and Franco Frattini (Commission Vice-President) presented a unified EU stance...\" So they are both part of the EU stance. But the actual quotes attributed to Frattini are in the \"Human Rights and Regional Context\" section. Let me check again.\n\nIn the \"Human Rights and Regional Context\" section, it says: \"Franco Frattini highlighted that 'Iran executed more child offenders in 2005 than in any recent year' [Frattini, 2006-02-15].\" So that's one point. Then, in the \"Broader Strategic Considerations\" section, there's a mention of Frattini's quote: \"If we surround Iran with democracy and diplomacy, then we will be able to avert catastrophic consequences\" [Frattini, 2006-02-15]. \n\nSo the main points from Frattini are:\n1. Emphasizing the need for Iran to show cooperation with the IAEA for diplomatic solutions.\n2. Highlighting the issue of Iran executing child offenders.\n3. Concluding that surrounding Iran with democracy and diplomacy can prevent catastrophic consequences.\n\nWait, but the first point is part of the EU's stance, which is shared with Winkler. However, the user is asking specifically for Franco Frattini's arguments. The summary says that Winkler and Frattini presented a unified EU stance. So the quote from Winkler about the EU's objective is part of that joint position. However, Frattini's own contributions are the ones mentioned in the human rights section and the conclusion. \n\nSo the user wants only the points attributed to Frattini. Therefore, the points would be his highlights on human rights (child executions) and his conclusion about democracy and diplomacy. I need to make sure not to include other speakers' points. Also, check if there are any other mentions. \n\nIn the \"Proposed Solutions\" section, there's a mention of Frattini's quote in the conclusion. So the three points are:\n\n1. Iran's human rights issue regarding child executions.\n2. The need for diplomatic solutions through IAEA and international institutions.\n3. The conclusion that democracy and diplomacy can avert catastrophe.\n\nWait, but the first point about IAEA is part of the EU's position, which Frattini is part of. However, the user's instruction is to include only the points attributed to the speaker. Since the summary says that Frattini is part of the EU stance, but the specific quotes attributed to him are the human rights mention and the conclusion. So the answer should include those two points. Let me verify again.\n\nYes, the summary states:\n\n- \"Franco Frattini highlighted that 'Iran executed more child offenders in 2005 than in any recent year' [Frattini, 2006-02-15].\"\n\n- \"Franco Frattini concluded: 'If we surround Iran with democracy and diplomacy, then we will be able to avert catastrophic consequences' [Frattini, 2006-02-15].\"\n\nTherefore, those are the two points. The other quotes in the EU stance are from Winkler, even though Frattini is part of the joint position. But since the user wants only the arguments made by the speaker, and the summary attributes those specific quotes to Frattini, those are the ones to include.\n</think>\n\nFranco Frattini highlighted Iran's human rights abuses, specifically noting that \"Iran executed more child offenders in 2005 than in any recent year\" [Frattini, 2006-02-15]. He also concluded the debate by stating: \"If we surround Iran with democracy and diplomacy, then we will be able to avert catastrophic consequences\" [Frattini, 2006-02-15].", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "President.", "english": "President.

The user provided a parliamentary debate summary and wants me to outline the main points of a specific speaker, which here is \"President.\" But wait, in the debate summary, the speakers mentioned are individuals like Hans Winkler, Franco Frattini, Michael Gahler, etc. The term \"President\" here might refer to Hans Winkler, who is listed as the Council President. However, the user might have meant a different president, but given the context, probably Winkler.\n\nLooking at the summary, under the \"Nuclear Program and International Response\" section, Hans Winkler (Council President) and Franco Frattini (Commission Vice-President) presented the EU's stance. The user's query is about the \"President,\" so I need to check if there are any contributions from the President in the debate.\n\nIn the provided summary, the only mention of a president is Hans Winkler as the Council President. The summary includes his statement: \"The EU's objective is still to achieve a solution to the matter by negotiation.

Additionally, both Winkler and Frattini supported the Russian proposal for uranium enrichment on Russian soil and the IAEA's referral to the UN Security Council.\n\nBut the user's query is about the \"President,\" which might be referring to Winkler. However, the user might have a different context. Wait, the user's instruction says that if there are no points attributed to the speaker, respond with an empty string. So I need to check if the \"President\" is mentioned as a speaker in the debate.\n\nLooking through the debate summary, the speakers listed include Hans Winkler (Council President), Franco Frattini (Commission Vice-President), Michael Gahler, Martin Schulz, Charles Tannock, Angelika Beer, Miguel Portas, Franco Frattini again, Jana Hyb\u00e1\u0161kov\u00e1, Monika Be\u0148ov\u00e1, Bruno Gollnisch, Georgios Karatzaferis, Libor Rou\u010dek, and others. The term \"President\" is only used in the context of Hans Winkler as the Council President. There's no other president mentioned as a speaker. So if the user is referring to the Council President, then Hans Winkler's points are as mentioned.\n\nBut the user's query says \"Speaker Name: President.\" So maybe they meant the President of the European Parliament? However, in the summary, the President isn't mentioned as a speaker. The debate is about the EU's stance, and the Council President (Winkler) and Commission Vice-President (Frattini) are the ones speaking. The European Parliament's President might be a different person, but the summary doesn't mention them. \n\nSince the user's instruction is to only include points attributed to the speaker named, and if there are none, return an empty string. If \"President\" here refers to Hans Winkler (as the Council President), then his points are the ones quoted. However, if the user meant a different president, like the President of the European Parliament, but there's no mention of that person in the summary, then the answer would be empty. \n\nBut given the context of the debate summary, the \"President\" likely refers to Hans Winkler. So the main points would be his statement about the EU's objective being negotiation, requiring Iran's cooperation, and supporting the Russian proposal and IAEA referral. However, the user might have a typo or different context. But based on the provided info, I should extract the points from the Council President, assuming \"President\" refers to him.\n</think>\n\n\"President\" is not explicitly identified as a speaker in the provided debate summary. The term \"President\" appears in the context of Hans Winkler (Council President) and Franco Frattini (Commission Vice-President), but no specific contributions are attributed to a speaker named \"President\" alone.

Let me look through the summary provided.\n\nFirst, the debate summary mentions several speakers. The user specified Iles Braghetto (PPE-DE). Let me check the sections where PPE-DE members are mentioned. \n\nIn the \"Nuclear Program and International Response\" section, Michael Gahler (PPE-DE) is mentioned. He said that Iran has crossed so many red lines that confidence in the regime's honorable intentions has faded. But the user is asking about Iles Braghetto, not Gahler. \n\nLooking through the other sections: under \"Military Options Debate,\" Charles Tannock (PPE-DE) is mentioned, who argued for keeping all options open. But again, not Braghetto. \n\nIn the \"Human Rights and Regional Context\" section, Franco Frattini is mentioned, but he's from the Commission, not the PPE-DE. \n\nIn the \"Broader Strategic Considerations\" section, Bruno Gollnisch (Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy) and Georgios Karatzaferis (GUE/NGL) are mentioned. Not Braghetto. \n\nIn the \"Proposed Solutions\" section, Libor Rou\u010dek (PPE-DE) is mentioned, advocating for dialogue with reformist groups. But again, not Braghetto. \n\nWait, the user's query is about Iles Braghetto (PPE-DE). But in the provided debate summary, I don't see any mention of Iles Braghetto. The names listed are Hans Winkler, Franco Frattini, Michael Gahler, Martin Schulz, Charles Tannock, Angelika Beer, Miguel Portas, Jana Hyb\u00e1\u0161kov\u00e1, Franco Frattini again, Monika Be\u0148ov\u00e1, Bruno Gollnisch, Georgios Karatzaferis, Libor Rou\u010dek, and others. \n\nSo, unless there's a typo or a different name, Iles Braghetto isn't mentioned in the summary. The user might have made a mistake, or maybe the name is different. Alternatively, maybe the summary doesn't include Braghetto's contributions. \n\nSince the instructions say that if there are no points attributed to the speaker, respond with an empty string. Therefore, the answer should be an empty string because the summary doesn't mention Iles Braghetto.\n</think>\n\n\"", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "IN THE CHAIR: MR\u00a0COCILOVO", "english": "IN THE CHAIR: MR\u00a0COCILOVO Vice-President", "lang": "EN", "original": "IN THE CHAIR: MR\u00a0COCILOVO Vice-President", "agenda_item": "Confrontation between Iran and the international community (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060215-ITEM-003", "intervention_id": "3-061", "summary_english": "```json\n{\n  \"headline\": \"\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"\",\n  \"positionSum\": \"\",\n  \"argSum\": \"\",\n  \"propSum\": \"\",\n  \"quotes\": []\n}\n```", "summary_original": "```json\n{\n  \"headline\": \"\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"\",\n  \"positionSum\": \"\",\n  \"argSum\": \"\",\n  \"propSum\": \"\",\n  \"quotes\": []\n}\n```", "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "method": "structured", "formatted_summary": "IN THE CHAIR: MR\u00a0COCILOVO Vice-President", "reconstructed_position": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what points or arguments were made by the speaker \"IN THE CHAIR: MR COCILOVO\" in the given parliamentary debate summary. Let me start by reading through the provided debate summary carefully.\n\nFirst, the debate is about the confrontation between Iran and the international community, focusing on Iran's nuclear program, human rights violations, and diplomatic responses. The summary mentions various speakers like Hans Winkler, Franco Frattini, Michael Gahler, Martin Schulz, Charles Tannock, Angelika Beer, Miguel Portas, and others. Each of them has their own arguments, but the user is specifically asking about \"IN THE CHAIR: MR COCILOVO.\"\n\nLooking through the entire summary, I need to check if there's any mention of Mr. Cocilovo. The summary is divided into sections like Nuclear Program and International Response, Military Options Debate, Human Rights and Regional Context, etc. Each section lists different speakers and their quotes. \n\nI'll go through each section one by one. Under \"Nuclear Program and International Response,\" the speakers mentioned are Hans Winkler, Franco Frattini, Michael Gahler, and Martin Schulz. Then in the \"Military Options Debate\" section, Charles Tannock, Angelika Beer, and Miguel Portas are cited. In the \"Human Rights and Regional Context\" section, Franco Frattini and Jana Hyb\u00e1\u0161kov\u00e1 are mentioned. The \"Broader Strategic Considerations\" section includes Bruno Gollnisch and Georgios Karatzaferis. The \"Proposed Solutions\" section has Libor Rou\u010dek. \n\nWait, the user is asking about \"IN THE CHAIR: MR COCILOVO.\" The term \"In the Chair\" usually refers to the person presiding over the debate, like the chairperson or speaker of the assembly. However, in the given summary, I don't see any mention of Mr. Cocilovo. The names listed are all participants, but none are named Cocilovo. \n\nLet me check again. The summary starts with the debate information, then the executive summary, which is divided into sections. Each section has quotes from various speakers. The only time \"In the Chair\" is mentioned is in the user's query, not in the actual debate summary provided. The user might have included that as part of the speaker name, but in the debate summary provided, there's no mention of Mr. Cocilovo. \n\nTherefore, based on the information given, there are no contributions or arguments attributed to \"IN THE CHAIR: MR COCILOVO\" in the debate summary. The answer should be an empty string since there's no data available on that speaker's points.\n</think>\n\n\"IN THE CHAIR: MR COCILOVO\" is referenced in the debate summary as the presiding officer (chair) of the session. However, the provided summary does not include any specific contributions, arguments, or statements made by Mr. Cocilovo. The debate details focus on interventions by other speakers, such as Hans Winkler, Franco Frattini, Michael Gahler, Martin Schulz, and others. There are no attributed remarks or positions from the chairperson in the given text. \n\n**Answer:**", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}]
