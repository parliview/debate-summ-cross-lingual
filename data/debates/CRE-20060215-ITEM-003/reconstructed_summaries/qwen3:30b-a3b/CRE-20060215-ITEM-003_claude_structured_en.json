Over recent years, the EU has spared no effort to find a solution by negotiation and to urge Iran to adopt confidence-building measures with regard to its nuclear programme. Iran has been moving in the wrong direction recently by taking unilateral action, most recently resuming uranium-enrichment activities at Natanz and suspending application of the IAEA Additional Protocol.\nThe adoption by the IAEA Board of Governors of its resolution of 4\u00a0February bringing the matter to the attention of the Security Council of the United Nations gave a clear signal to Iran. The large majority by which the resolution was adopted demonstrates that Europe\u2019s deep concern about Iran\u2019s nuclear programme is shared by the international community as a whole.\nThe EU is by no means calling into question Iran\u2019s right to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. The cause of this conflict lies in Iran\u2019s failure to take sufficient action to date to build the necessary confidence in the peaceful nature of its nuclear programme. On the contrary, over the last 18\u00a0years, Iran has failed to declare a substantial part of its very extensive nuclear programme to the IAEA, and is still refusing to provide it with important information concerning, in particular, the extent of development of its uranium-enrichment technology and the field of \u2018weaponisation\u2019 \u2013 that is, the militarisation of its nuclear programme.\nThe EU\u2019s objective is still to achieve a solution to the matter by negotiation. Yet this requires that Iran show sufficient willingness to be cooperative and open, in particular towards the IAEA, and to take urgently needed confidence-building measures such as suspending sensitive nuclear activities. The Russian proposal to build a Russian-Iranian uranium-enrichment facility on Russian soil as an alternative to enrichment in Iran is an important contribution and has the full support of the EU.\nLet me reiterate quite clearly that the EU remains committed to a diplomatic solution to the Iranian nuclear issue, in which the IAEA must play a key role. Involving the Security Council is not tantamount to diminishing the role of the IAEA, but rather is intended to strengthen the IAEA\u2019s authority and make it possible to implement the measures required by the resolutions of its Board of Governors.\nOn the subject of relations between the EU and Iran, the EU still regards the human-rights situation in Iran with great concern. The situation is worsening, and the Iranian authorities are not taking any tangible action to reform legislation or official practices. Despite repeated requests by the EU, Iran has failed to make any further commitment to resuming the stalled human-rights dialogue. The EU will continue to voice its human-rights concerns, both directly to the Iranian Government and in public statements and international forums.\nThe statements made by the Iranian President on Israel have been unambiguously and strongly condemned by the EU and the international community as a whole. Iran\u2019s position on the Middle East gives grounds for grave concern. It still supports Palestinian groups that the EU classifies as terrorist organisations. We note with concern that the Iranian President recently met some of the leaders of such groups in Syria, and we call on Iran to end such contacts. In addition, we call for it to join the international consensus on the necessity of a two-state solution to the Middle East conflict.\nThe repeated attempts by the Iranian President to deny the crimes of the Holocaust, and his calls for the state of Israel to be \u2018wiped off the map\u2019, are to be firmly rejected. Statements such as this are completely unacceptable and, furthermore, are totally at odds with the efforts of the numerous political and religious leaders who are specifically working on all sides to promote a dialogue between the cultures that is characterised by mutual respect, particularly following the events of recent days.\nThe EU\u2019s relations with Iran will depend on progress made on all of the issues of concern: the nuclear issue and other concerns in connection with weapons of mass destruction, human rights, the fight against terrorism and the country\u2019s position on the Middle East. The options for action by the EU will be kept under close review and weighed up in the light of Iran\u2019s declarations and actions.\nOn the subject of the violence: as has been clearly underlined in the debate in this House, the attacks on bodies of the European Union are in no way justifiable, and are completely unacceptable. The EU Presidency has condemned these attacks and called on Iran to meet its obligations with regard to the protection laid down in the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961. In accordance with these obligations, the Presidency has also reminded Iran that responsibility under international law for ensuring compliance with these obligations lies with the state.\n(Applause)", "lang": "DE", "original": "Hans Winkler, amtierender Ratspr\u00e4sident . Herr Pr\u00e4sident, meine sehr verehrten Damen und Herren! In dieser Erkl\u00e4rung des Rates \u00fcber die Konfrontation des Iran mit der internationalen Gemeinschaft m\u00f6chte ich zu folgenden Themen Stellung nehmen. Erstens zur Nuklearfrage, zweitens zu den Beziehungen zwischen der Europ\u00e4ischen Union und dem Iran und drittens zu den j\u00fcngsten Ausschreitungen in Teheran.\nZur Nuklearfrage: Eine L\u00f6sung der iranischen Atomfrage ist ein zentrales Anliegen der internationalen Gemeinschaft, die ernste Bedenken hinsichtlich der friedlichen Natur des iranischen Atomprogramms hat. Im Laufe der letzten Jahre hat die Europ\u00e4ische Union keine Anstrengungen gescheut, eine L\u00f6sung auf dem Verhandlungsweg zu finden und den Iran zu vertrauensbildenden Ma\u00dfnahmen hinsichtlich seines Atomprogramms zu dr\u00e4ngen. Der Iran hat sich in j\u00fcngster Vergangenheit durch einseitige Schritte \u2013 wie zuletzt die Wiederaufnahme von Urananreicherungsaktivit\u00e4ten in Natanz und die Aussetzung der Anwendung des IAEA-Zusatzprotokolls \u2013 in die falsche Richtung bewegt.\nDer IAEA-Gouverneursrat hat mit der Annahme der Resolution vom 4.\u00a0Februar, die die Angelegenheit dem Sicherheitsrat der Vereinten Nationen zur Kenntnis bringt, ein klares Signal an den Iran gegeben. Die breite Mehrheit, mit der die Resolution angenommen wurde, ist der Beweis daf\u00fcr, dass die tiefe Besorgnis Europas \u00fcber das iranische Atomprogramm von der gesamten internationalen Staatengemeinschaft geteilt wird.\nDie Europ\u00e4ische Union stellt das Recht des Irans auf Nutzung der Kernenergie zu friedlichen Zwecken keinesfalls in Frage. Die Ursache dieses Konfliktes ist darin zu suchen, dass der Iran bis zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt nicht genug unternommen hat, um das notwendige Vertrauen in den friedlichen Charakter seines Atomprogramms zu schaffen. Im Gegenteil, der Iran hat im Laufe der letzten 18\u00a0Jahre einen wesentlichen Bestandteil seines sehr umfangreichen Atomprogramms nicht der IAEA deklariert und verweigert der IAEA bis zum heutigen Tage wichtige Informationen. Dies betrifft insbesondere das Ausma\u00df der Entwicklung von Urananreicherungstechnologie und den Bereich der \u201eweaponisation\u201c, d.\u00a0h. der Militarisierung seines Atomprogramms.\nDas Ziel der EU ist es nach wie vor, eine L\u00f6sung der Angelegenheit durch Verhandlungen zu erreichen. Dies erfordert aber ein ausreichendes Ma\u00df an Bereitschaft zur Zusammenarbeit und Transparenz von iranischer Seite, insbesondere gegen\u00fcber der IAEA, und zu dringend notwendigen vertrauensbildenden Ma\u00dfnahmen, wie die Aussetzung von sensiblen Nuklearaktivit\u00e4ten von iranischer Seite. Der russische Vorschlag zum Aufbau einer russisch-iranischen Urananreicherungskapazit\u00e4t auf russischem Boden als Alternative zur Anreicherung im Iran ist ein wichtiger Beitrag und wird von der EU voll und ganz unterst\u00fctzt.\nDie EU \u2013 ich wiederhole das in aller Deutlichkeit \u2013 bleibt einer diplomatischen L\u00f6sung der iranischen Atomfrage verpflichtet, bei der die IAEA eine zentrale Rolle spielen muss. Die Befassung des Sicherheitsrates ist nicht gleichbedeutend mit einer Schm\u00e4lerung der Rolle der IAEA, sondern soll vielmehr die Autorit\u00e4t der IAEA st\u00e4rken und eine Umsetzung der in den Resolutionen des IAEA Gouverneursrates geforderten Ma\u00dfnahmen erm\u00f6glichen.\nZu den Beziehungen EU-Iran: Die EU betrachtet die Menschenrechtslage in Iran weiterhin mit gro\u00dfer Sorge. Die Lage verschlimmert sich, und seitens der iranischen Beh\u00f6rden werden keine konkreten Ma\u00dfnahmen f\u00fcr eine Gesetzesreform und eine Reform der offiziellen Praktiken ergriffen. Trotz wiederholter Anfragen der EU hat Iran keine erneute Zusage f\u00fcr eine Fortsetzung des Menschenrechtsdialogs, der derzeit unterbrochen ist, gegeben. Die Europ\u00e4ische Union wird ihre Menschenrechtsanliegen weiterhin sowohl direkt gegen\u00fcber der iranischen Staatsf\u00fchrung als auch in \u00f6ffentlichen Erkl\u00e4rungen und in internationalen Gremien zur Sprache bringen.\nDie \u00c4u\u00dferungen des iranischen Pr\u00e4sidenten zu Israel sind von der Europ\u00e4ischen Union und der gesamten internationalen Gemeinschaft in aller Deutlichkeit und Sch\u00e4rfe verurteilt worden. Die Haltung des Irans zum Nahen Osten gibt Grund zu ernsthafter Besorgnis. Der Iran unterst\u00fctzt nach wie vor pal\u00e4stinensische Gruppierungen, die von der EU als terroristische Organisationen eingestuft sind. Mit Besorgnis nehmen wir die Tatsache zur Kenntnis, dass sich der iranische Pr\u00e4sident vor kurzem in Syrien mit einigen Anf\u00fchrern solcher Gruppierungen getroffen hat, und fordern den Iran auf, derartige Kontakte zu beenden. Wir rufen den Iran ferner auf, sich dem internationalen Konsens \u00fcber die Notwendigkeit einer Zweistaatenl\u00f6sung im Nahostkonflikt anzuschlie\u00dfen.\nDie wiederholten Versuche des iranischen Pr\u00e4sidenten, die Verbrechen des Holocaust in Abrede zu stellen, und seine Forderungen, den Staat Israel \u201ezu beseitigen\u201c, m\u00fcssen scharf zur\u00fcckgewiesen werden. Derartige Aussagen sind v\u00f6llig inakzeptabel. Sie stehen au\u00dferdem in einem vollkommenen Widerspruch zu den Bem\u00fchungen zahlreicher politischer und religi\u00f6ser F\u00fchrer, die sich gerade nach den Ereignissen der j\u00fcngsten Tage allseits gezielt f\u00fcr einen Dialog zwischen den Kulturen einsetzen, der vom gegenseitigen Respekt gepr\u00e4gt ist.\nDie Beziehungen der EU zum Iran werden von den Fortschritten bei s\u00e4mtlichen Problempunkten abh\u00e4ngen: bei der Atomfrage und anderen Anliegen in Zusammenhang mit Massenvernichtungswaffen, den Menschenrechten, der Terrorismusbek\u00e4mpfung und der Haltung zum Nahen Osten. Die Optionen f\u00fcr das Vorgehen der EU werden weiterhin genauestens \u00fcberpr\u00fcft und im Licht des Vorgehens und der Erkl\u00e4rungen der iranischen Seite abgewogen werden.\nZu den Ausschreitungen: Die Angriffe gegen Einrichtungen der Europ\u00e4ischen Union \u2013 das wurde in der Debatte hier deutlich unterstrichen \u2013 sind durch nichts zu rechtfertigen und v\u00f6llig unannehmbar. Die Pr\u00e4sidentschaft der Europ\u00e4ischen Union hat diese Angriffe verurteilt und den Iran aufgefordert, seinen Verpflichtungen im Sinne des in der Wiener Konvention \u00fcber Diplomatische Beziehungen von 1961 festgeschriebenen Schutzes nachzukommen. Sie hat im Einklang mit diesen Verpflichtungen den Iran auch daran erinnert, dass die v\u00f6lkerrechtliche Verantwortung, daf\u00fcr Sorge zu tragen, dass diese Verpflichtungen eingehalten werden, beim Staat liegt.\n(Beifall)", "agenda_item": "Confrontation between Iran and the international community (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060215-ITEM-003", "intervention_id": "3-025", "summary_english": "{\n  \"headline\": \"EU Condemns Iran's Nuclear Activities, Human Rights Violations, and Diplomatic Attacks While Pursuing Diplomatic Solution\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"The speaker addresses three key issues regarding Iran: 1) Iran's nuclear programme and failure to comply with IAEA requirements, including resumption of uranium enrichment and suspension of IAEA protocols; 2) Iran's human rights violations, denial of Holocaust, threats against Israel, and support for terrorist organizations; 3) Recent attacks on EU diplomatic bodies in Tehran violating international law.\",\n  \"positionSum\": \"The EU strongly condemns Iran's actions across multiple fronts while maintaining commitment to diplomatic solutions.

Mr President, it is clear that Iran needs to take visible and credible steps back in order to regain the confidence of the international community. For the past few months the nuclear file has been at the centre of EU concerns with Iran, and rightly so. The region does not need further tension and prospects of nuclear escalation. Despite the persistent efforts for dialogue of the so-called EU-3 and of other international partners, Iran has not engaged in a convincing way. That is why, as a result of the vote of the International Atomic Energy Agency Board in Vienna on 4\u00a0February, Iran\u2019s nuclear dossier is now to be reported to the United Nations Security Council.\nThe Iranian reaction was the decision to step up its enrichment programme and to cease implementing the additional protocol. That is unacceptable news, although Iran expected to continue cooperating with the IAEA on the basis of the Non-Proliferation Treaty.\nA substantial majority of the international community, including Russia and China, now stand firmly behind the reporting of Iran to the Security Council, agreeing that Iran needs to return to a suspension of its enrichment activities. There must be no mistake in Tehran about the resolve of the international community. At the same time the door still remains open for a negotiated settlement through diplomatic efforts, provided that Iran takes the necessary steps.\nIran\u2019s tactic of trying to divide the international community proved unsuccessful on this occasion, as it did last autumn. The Russian proposal to enrich uranium outside of Iran is still on the table and needs to be explored fully. If Iran returns to a suspension of its enrichment activities and accepts the Russian proposal, the Security Council track may not prove necessary. The prospects depend very much on the will of Tehran to compromise and engage with the international community, and to do so swiftly.\nWe shall not speculate on further steps, but if the situation continues to deteriorate, we will need to consider options for further action through the United Nations. The United Nations Security Council will revert to the issue in the light of Mr\u00a0El\u00a0Baradei\u2019s report and the next meeting of the IAEA Board starting on 6\u00a0March. Conversely, if things evolve in the right direction, more could be done through Community actions. If and when the situation calls for that, we must be able to re-engage Iran through a series of EU and Community instruments. We are ready to engage constructively, and Iran knows that.\nThe nuclear issue is not a dispute between Iran and Europe or between Iran and the United States, but between Iran and the larger international community. Nor is it a dispute about Iran\u2019s right under the Non-Proliferation Treaty. It is about Iran\u2019s failure to build the necessary confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear programme. Indeed, Iran has the right to develop research, production and the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. For that, without discrimination, we need objective guarantees on the peaceful nature of Iran\u2019s nuclear programme.\nI should like to say a few words about President Ahmadinejad\u2019s statements on issues that affect regional stability and international relations. His unacceptable remarks regarding Israel and the Holocaust sparked global outrage. We feel that those statements are a profound offence to all of us. It is also totally unacceptable \u2013 as the Presidency has just said \u2013 that Iran continues to support terrorist organisations in the Middle East.\nWith regard to human rights, you may recall that on 12\u00a0December the General Affairs and External Relations Council found the situation grave enough to adopt conclusions on the state of EU-Iran human rights dialogue. Stating what is for me a fundamental requirement vis-\u00e0-vis Iran, the European Union reaffirmed that greater respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in Iran is essential if there is to be progress in EU-Iran relations.\nI should like to emphasise some points of major concern. There have been an increasing number of public executions and death sentences \u2013 juvenile executions in particular. Iran executed more child offenders in 2005 than in any recent year. There are restrictions on freedom of expression, with widespread censorship of the internet and the press \u2013 even the former speaker of parliament and presidential candidate, Mr Karroubi, could not get authorisation to broadcast his new television channel from Dubai. On the plight of human rights defenders, we are very much concerned about the fate of prisoners of conscience, such as Mr Akbar Ganji and his lawyer Mr\u00a0Abdolfattah Soltani. The list of human rights concerns in Iran remains worryingly long.\nThe Commission looks forward to a continued exchange with Parliament regarding the matter of Iran. The situation is critical, but the long-term objective continues to be, despite everything, that deeper and broader relations should be established with a country that is an important regional and international player.\n(Applause)", "lang": "EN", "original": "Franco Frattini, Vice-President of the Commission .

If and when the situation calls for that, we must be able to re-engage Iran through a series of EU and Community instruments. We are ready to engage constructively, and Iran knows that.\nThe nuclear issue is not a dispute between Iran and Europe or between Iran and the United States, but between Iran and the larger international community. Nor is it a dispute about Iran\u2019s right under the Non-Proliferation Treaty. It is about Iran\u2019s failure to build the necessary confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear programme. Indeed, Iran has the right to develop research, production and the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. For that, without discrimination, we need objective guarantees on the peaceful nature of Iran\u2019s nuclear programme.\nI should like to say a few words about President Ahmadinejad\u2019s statements on issues that affect regional stability and international relations. His unacceptable remarks regarding Israel and the Holocaust sparked global outrage. We feel that those statements are a profound offence to all of us. It is also totally unacceptable \u2013 as the Presidency has just said \u2013 that Iran continues to support terrorist organisations in the Middle East.\nWith regard to human rights, you may recall that on 12\u00a0December the General Affairs and External Relations Council found the situation grave enough to adopt conclusions on the state of EU-Iran human rights dialogue. Stating what is for me a fundamental requirement vis-\u00e0-vis Iran, the European Union reaffirmed that greater respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in Iran is essential if there is to be progress in EU-Iran relations.\nI should like to emphasise some points of major concern. There have been an increasing number of public executions and death sentences \u2013 juvenile executions in particular. Iran executed more child offenders in 2005 than in any recent year. There are restrictions on freedom of expression, with widespread censorship of the internet and the press \u2013 even the former speaker of parliament and presidential candidate, Mr Karroubi, could not get authorisation to broadcast his new television channel from Dubai. On the plight of human rights defenders, we are very much concerned about the fate of prisoners of conscience, such as Mr Akbar Ganji and his lawyer Mr\u00a0Abdolfattah Soltani. The list of human rights concerns in Iran remains worryingly long.\nThe Commission looks forward to a continued exchange with Parliament regarding the matter of Iran. The situation is critical, but the long-term objective continues to be, despite everything, that deeper and broader relations should be established with a country that is an important regional and international player.\n(Applause)", "agenda_item": "Confrontation between Iran and the international community (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060215-ITEM-003", "intervention_id": "3-027", "summary_english": "```json\n{\n  \"headline\": \"Iran Must Take Credible Steps Back on Nuclear Program to Regain International Community's Confidence\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"The speaker addresses Iran's nuclear enrichment program and its referral to the UN Security Council, Iran's failure to engage convincingly in dialogue with the EU-3 and international partners, President Ahmadinejad's unacceptable statements about Israel and the Holocaust, Iran's support for terrorist organizations, and serious human rights violations including public executions, juvenile executions, restrictions on freedom of expression, and persecution of human rights defenders.\",\n  \"positionSum\": \"The speaker firmly supports the international community's position that Iran must suspend its enrichment activities and return to negotiations.

The user provided a debate summary about Iran and the international community, and they want the main points from Franco Frattini's speech. First, I need to go through the debate summary and find all mentions of Franco Frattini.\n\nLooking at the summary, there's a section under \"Nuclear Program Concerns\" where Franco Frattini is mentioned. He says that Iran needs to take visible and credible steps back to regain international confidence. Then, in the \"Human Rights and Regional Stability\" section, he's quoted about the Holocaust and Israel remarks sparking global outrage. \n\nI need to make sure I only include his points. The user specified not to include other speakers' contributions. So, the issues he raised are Iran's nuclear program and human rights issues. His positions are demanding Iran take steps back and condemning the statements. The arguments are based on justifying international concern and the offensive nature of the remarks. Proposals might include diplomatic steps, but the summary doesn't mention specific proposals from him beyond the steps back. Wait, the user's example includes propSum even if it's a general suggestion. So, I'll structure the JSON with those points. Need to check if there's more. Also, check if there's any other mention of him. The \"International Unity and Consistency\" section mentions him? No, that's another speaker. So the answer should have issueSum about nuclear program and human rights, positionSum about needing steps back and condemning statements, argSum about justifying concern and offensive remarks, and propSum maybe the steps back as a proposal. But the example's propSum is a specific action. Since the summary says he argued for steps back, that's a proposal.

Neither its reduced cooperation with the IAEA, its President\u2019s threat that Iran would leave the Non-Proliferation Treaty, its postponement of the talks with Russia that had been scheduled for this Thursday nor, in particular, its resumption of uranium enrichment, are conducive to building confidence and defusing the situation.\nThis makes it all the more important to continue to present a resolute, united front to Iran.

Those who believe that our unconditional desire for peace alone will induce our opposite numbers to change course and see the light are doing our natural yearning for peace a disservice.

However, I should also like to ask the House to reflect on what is more important: having time for a proper debate, or Members of this House complaining when a vote is taken. I should have liked to hear Mr\u00a0Gahler out, as what he was saying was most fascinating. Indeed, the question he raised is one of the ones that preoccupies us most at the present time.\nHow do we deal with a regime that is quite blatantly pushing all its boundaries? How do we respond to that as an international community? In my speech I shall try to add some further questions from the point of view of my group. It is not necessary to comment in this House on the remarks made by the Iranian President. A Head of State who denies the Holocaust, and who calls into question Israel\u2019s right to exist, is not a fitting dialogue partner for us.\nAll the values that President Ahmadinejad stands for are the opposite of those we stand for, and I should welcome a debate on values with these people. We have already had a debate on values this morning; and that was good \u2013 it was a serious, considered debate. We should hold a calm, self-confident debate, and see whether there are others in the region besides President Ahmadinejad with whom we can hold dialogue. We should reflect on options open to us before we philosophise about options closing.\nAre there not sufficient moderate countries in the region who are open to dialogue and with whom we can cooperate, who may not share our values one-to-one, but to whose interests it is also entirely detrimental to have Iran become a leading nuclear power in the region? Yes, there are, and, in my view, they are suitable dialogue partners for the EU. In this connection, of course, the conflict over the caricatures not only comes at the worst possible time, but is even counterproductive in the extreme, for these are the very countries with whom we need a relationship of mutual respect. Solving this caricature conflict is also central to solving the problems of the region as a whole, therefore.\nFor this reason, I would advise against equating \u2018Iran\u2019 and \u2018Islam\u2019. The actions of one aggressive Head of State of one country do not in any way reflect the views of the vast majority of peace-loving Muslims around the world, with whom we have to cooperate.\nI think it is right that all enrichment activities \u2013 that is, those by all countries \u2013 should be under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency, as proposed by the IAEA itself. We should support this proposal. I also think, incidentally, that it is perfectly justifiable to refresh memories and say that the debate on nuclear disarmament should not be limited to this region: it needs to be universal. In this connection, allow me to point out that treating countries who already have nuclear weapons differently from those who are on the way to having them, and carrying out pre-emptive strikes against countries who did not have any weapons of mass destruction, only encourages regimes to procure nuclear weapons as quickly and illegally as possible, because those who own them will not be attacked. This is a logic that also needs to be discussed, one that was triggered by a pre-emptive strike carried out in the same region in the past, which was utterly wrong and which we vehemently opposed.\nI believe that the logic behind this was extremely dangerous, and that is why we have to abandon this strategy of goal-based thinking, as it leads to the militarisation of thought. We must reinforce our diplomatic options step by step. It was an enormous accomplishment on the part of the EU-3 to bring China and Russia together and thus give Iran a clear signal that the international community will not allow itself to be divided. Let us talk about diplomatic successes instead of philosophising about military options. The international community should do everything in its power to make it clear to Iran that failure to return to the negotiating table by 6\u00a0March will automatically trigger a referral to the Security Council. Subsequent action should then be decided there, however, rather than by just any central government.\n(Applause)", "lang": "DE", "original": "Martin Schulz, im Namen der PSE-Fraktion . \u2013 Herr Pr\u00e4sident!

Ich h\u00e4tte den Ausf\u00fchrungen von Herrn Gahler gerne noch zu Ende zugeh\u00f6rt, weil sie sehr spannend waren. Die Frage, die er aufgeworfen hat, ist ja eine der Fragen, die uns zurzeit am st\u00e4rksten besch\u00e4ftigen.\nWie gehen wir mit einem Regime um, das seinerseits ganz offensichtlich alle Grenzen austestet? Welche Antworten geben wir als Staatengemeinschaft darauf? Ich will in meinen Ausf\u00fchrungen versuchen, diesen Fragen einige Fragen aus der Sicht meiner Fraktion hinzuzuf\u00fcgen. Die \u00c4u\u00dferungen des iranischen Staatspr\u00e4sidenten braucht man hier in dieser Versammlung nicht zu kommentieren. Ein Staatschef, der den Holocaust leugnet, der das Existenzrecht Israels in Frage stellt, ist kein Dialogpartner f\u00fcr uns.\nAlles, was Herr Ahmadinedschad an Werten repr\u00e4sentiert, ist das Gegenteil von dem, was wir an Werten repr\u00e4sentieren, und ich w\u00fcrde mich dar\u00fcber freuen, dass wir mit diesen Leuten eine Wertedebatte f\u00fchren. Das haben wir heute Morgen schon getan, das war gut, das war seri\u00f6s und \u00fcberlegt. Diese Debatte, auf ruhigem Niveau und selbstbewusst, sollten wir f\u00fchren und danach schauen, ob es in der Region neben Herrn Ahmadinedschad andere Dialogpartner f\u00fcr uns gibt. Bevor wir \u00fcber das Ende unserer Optionen philosophieren sollten wir \u00fcber den Anfang unserer M\u00f6glichkeiten nachdenken.\nGibt es in der Region nicht gen\u00fcgend moderate, dialogbereite Staaten, mit denen wir kooperieren k\u00f6nnen, die vielleicht nicht unsere Werte eins zu eins teilen, aber die auch ihrerseits \u00fcberhaupt kein Interesse daran haben, dass der Iran zur atomar ger\u00fcsteten Vormacht in der Region wird. Diese Staaten gibt es, und sie sind meiner Meinung nach der geeignete Dialogpartner f\u00fcr die Europ\u00e4ische Union. In diesem Zusammenhang kommt nat\u00fcrlich der Karikaturenstreit nicht nur zum ung\u00fcnstigsten Zeitpunkt, sondern ist geradezu extrem kontraproduktiv. Denn gerade diese Staaten brauchen wir auf der Grundlage des gegenseitigen Respekts. Deshalb ist die L\u00f6sung dieses Karikaturenstreits auch vorrangig f\u00fcr die L\u00f6sung der Probleme in der gesamten Region.\nDeshalb rate ich dazu, \u201eIran\u201c und \u201eIslam\u201c nicht gleichzusetzen. Ein aggressiver Staatschef eines Staates ist eine Sache. Er repr\u00e4sentiert aber mit nichts, was er tut, die \u00fcberwiegende Mehrheit von friedliebenden Muslimen in der Welt, mit denen wir zusammenarbeiten m\u00fcssen.\nIch finde, dass der Vorschlag der IAEO, dass die Anreicherung generell \u2013 und zwar f\u00fcr alle Staaten \u2013 unter der Kontrolle der Internationalen Atomenergiebeh\u00f6rde stattfinden soll, richtig ist.

Ich finde \u00fcbrigens auch, dass es durchaus gerechtfertigt ist, daran zu erinnern, dass eine atomare Abr\u00fcstungsdebatte nicht auf diese Region reduziert werden darf. Wir brauchen sie weltweit! In diesem Zusammenhang sei mir ein Hinweis erlaubt: Wenn Staaten, die bereits Atomwaffen besitzen, anders behandelt werden, als die Staaten, die auf dem Weg dorthin sind, wenn, obwohl es keine Massenvernichtungswaffen gegeben hat, Pr\u00e4ventivschl\u00e4ge gegen ein Land ausgef\u00fchrt werden, dann ermutigt das Regime, sich m\u00f6glichst schnell und m\u00f6glichst illegal Atomwaffen zu beschaffen, denn wer sie besitzt, der wird nicht angegriffen. Das ist eine Logik, \u00fcber die wir auch diskutieren m\u00fcssen, die ausgel\u00f6st wurde durch einen v\u00f6llig falschen Pr\u00e4ventivschlag, der in der Vergangenheit auch in dieser Region durchgef\u00fchrt wurde und gegen den wir uns massiv gewehrt haben.\nIch glaube, dass die Logik, die dahinter steckte, sehr, sehr gef\u00e4hrlich war. Deshalb m\u00fcssen wir diese Strategie des Denkens vom Ende her aufgeben. Denn die Strategie, vom Ende her zu denken, f\u00fchrt zu einer Militarisierung des Denkens. Wir m\u00fcssen Schritt f\u00fcr Schritt die diplomatischen Optionen verst\u00e4rken. Es war doch ein Riesenerfolg der EU3, dass wir China und Russland mit an einen Tisch bekommen und damit dem Iran klar gemacht haben: Die Staatengemeinschaft l\u00e4sst sich nicht auseinander dividieren. Lassen Sie uns doch \u00fcber diplomatische Erfolge reden, statt \u00fcber milit\u00e4rische Optionen zu philosophieren. Wir sollten alles, was in der M\u00f6glichkeit der internationalen Staatengemeinschaft steht, tun, um dem Iran klarzumachen: Kehrt er nicht bis zum 6.\u00a0M\u00e4rz an den Verhandlungstisch zur\u00fcck, ist der Weg zum Weltsicherheitsrat vorprogrammiert.

The user provided a debate summary about Iran and the international community, and they want the main points from Martin Schulz's speech.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the debate summary and find any mentions of Martin Schulz. Scanning through the sections, under the \"Diplomatic vs. Military Options\" section, there's a mention of Martin Schulz. He opposed military action, arguing that treating countries with nuclear weapons differently and pre-emptive strikes encourages regimes to get nuclear weapons illegally.\n\nSo, the key issue here is the use of military force versus diplomacy. His position is against military action, emphasizing that it's counterproductive. The argument is that military strikes might push Iran to develop nuclear weapons more quickly. The proposal isn't explicitly stated, but his position is about preferring diplomatic solutions over military ones.\n\nI need to make sure I don't include other speakers' points. The user specified to only include what's attributed to Martin Schulz. The example response structure is important here. The issueSum should capture the main issue he raised, which is the opposition to military action. PositionSum is his stance against military options. The argument is based on the idea that military actions encourage Iran to procure nuclear weapons. There's no specific proposal mentioned, so propSum might be empty or not applicable. Wait, the example had a propSum even if it's a position. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, even if there's no proposal, maybe it's okay to leave it as an empty string. The user said if there are no points, respond with an empty string. But in this case, Martin Schulz's contribution is about opposing military action, so the propSum might be his advocacy for diplomatic solutions. Wait, the example's propSum was \"He advocates for strict limitations on government demands for private data\". So maybe in this case, the proposal is to avoid military options and focus on diplomacy. But the debate summary says he \"strongly opposed military action\" and argued against pre-emptive strikes. So the propSum would be about preferring diplomatic solutions over military ones. But the original debate summary doesn't mention any specific proposal from him beyond his opposition. The key proposals in the summary are from others, like the Russian proposal. So perhaps Martin Schulz's propSum is his call for diplomatic engagement instead of military options. \n\nSo structuring the JSON: issueSum is about military action vs diplomacy, positionSum is opposing military action, argSum is that it encourages regimes to get nuclear weapons, propSum is advocating for diplomatic solutions. But need to check the exact wording from the debate summary. The exact quote is \"Martin Schulz strongly opposed military action, arguing that 'treating countries who already have nuclear weapons differently from those who are on the way to having them, and carrying out pre-emptive strikes against countries who did not have any weapons of mass destruction, only encourages regimes to procure nuclear weapons as quickly and illegally as possible.'\"\n\nSo the issue is the use of military force. His position is opposing military action. The argument is that it encourages regimes to get nuclear weapons. The proposal would be to avoid military options and focus on diplomacy, but the debate summary doesn't mention a specific proposal from him beyond his opposition. So maybe propSum is \"advocating for diplomatic solutions over military action\" or similar. But the user's example had \"He advocates for strict limitations...\" so maybe in this case, the propSum is \"advocating for diplomatic solutions over military action\" even if not explicitly stated as a proposal. Alternatively, if there's no explicit proposal, maybe propSum is empty. But the user's example included a proposal even if it's part of the position. \n\nI think the safest way is to structure based on the given text. Since the user's example included a proposal even if it's part of the position, I'll structure it as such. So:\n\nissueSum: The issue of military action against Iran and its implications.\npositionSum: Opposed military action, believing it encourages nuclear proliferation.\nargSum: Argued that treating countries differently and pre-emptive strikes encourage regimes to procure nuclear weapons.\npropSum: Advocated for diplomatic solutions instead of military options.\n\nBut need to make sure it's concise and matches the exact points from the debate summary. The exact words from the debate summary for Martin Schulz are about opposing military action and the reasoning. So the JSON should reflect that.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The issue of military action against Iran and its implications for nuclear proliferation.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"Martin Schulz strongly opposed military action, arguing that it would encourage regimes to procure nuclear weapons illegally.\",\n\"argSum\": \"He argued that treating countries with nuclear weapons differently and carrying out pre-emptive strikes against countries without weapons of mass destruction would encourage regimes to accelerate their nuclear programs.\",\n\"propSum\": \"Advocated for diplomatic solutions over military options to address Iran's nuclear ambitions.\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Annemie Neyts-Uyttebroeck,", "english": "Annemie Neyts-Uyttebroeck, on behalf of the ALDE Group . \u2013 (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, after two and a half years of intensive research and inspections, the International Atomic Agency has been unable to confirm the peaceful character of the Iranian nuclear programme, and basic questions remain unanswered.\nIran\u2019s recent decisions to resume the uranium enrichment activities and to suspend all voluntary cooperation with the Agency are particularly worrying, not least in the light of the Iranian President\u2019s statements denying Israel\u2019s right to exist and of the general tightening of rules that has been noted in Iran.\nNow that the issue has been passed on to the Security Council, things are gaining momentum, even though it has been decided to wait for the next report which Mr\u00a0El\u00a0Baradei will be submitting on 6 March.\nThe stakes are extraordinarily high.

The user provided a debate summary about Iran and the international community, and they want me to focus on Bruno Gollnisch's contributions. The task is to extract his main points, positions, arguments, and proposals from the debate summary.\n\nFirst, I need to scan through the debate summary to find any mentions of Bruno Gollnisch. The user mentioned that the speaker is Bruno Gollnisch (NI). Looking at the \"International Unity and Consistency\" section, there's a quote from him: \"we must remember firstly that it is Europe that has sold this nuclear technology to Iran\" and questioning why certain countries are allowed to have nuclear weapons without reaction.\n\nSo, the key points here are his critique of Europe's role in providing nuclear technology to Iran and his questioning of double standards in international nuclear policy. The issue he raises is about the perceived double standards in nuclear policy. His position is that there's a hypocrisy in how nuclear technology is handled, with some countries allowed to have weapons while others are not. The argument is that Europe's past actions (selling technology) contribute to the current situation, and he's pointing out the inconsistency in international responses. His proposal isn't explicitly stated, but his argument is about highlighting these double standards, which might imply a call for more consistent policies.\n\nI need to structure this into the JSON format as specified. The issueSum should capture the double standards and Europe's role. PositionSum would be his criticism of the double standards. The argument is based on Europe's historical actions and the inconsistency in nuclear policy. There's no specific proposal mentioned, so propSum might be empty. Wait, the example response had propSum even if it's a call to action. But in the debate summary, Bruno Gollnisch's contribution is more about pointing out the problem rather than proposing a solution. So maybe propSum is empty.

Today\u2019s Iran is potentially dangerous. Tomorrow\u2019s Iran, armed with nuclear weapons, is a definite danger.\nAgainst this backdrop, the citizens expect the EU to guarantee their security and to be a stabilising factor on the world stage.

We believe that the EU\u2019s first task should be to strive to maintain a cohesive and resolute response among the international community to the regional and global threat posed by Iran.\nWe must not allow the current difficulties and these politically sensitive times to lead to rifts, when what is at stake is something as fundamental as our global security. Iran needs to know that the diplomatic route remains open, but also that it is up to Iran to restore trust by means of practical, verifiable moves towards the total suspension of its uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities. It must also abandon its provocative rhetoric on Israel and the holocaust, and must commit itself to a policy, acceptable to the international community, of respect for human rights and for opposition parties.\nWhat appropriate, effective measures can be taken to achieve these goals? This is the key question to which we must respond.\nMr President, it is increasingly clear that the relevance of the EU\u2019s role on the international stage depends entirely on its deeds.

That is an important point to emphasise. We believe that the Russian proposal to build a Russian-Iranian uranium-enrichment facility on Russian soil would be a good alternative to enrichment in Iran: this solution has the full support of the EU. Some have said that Austria should take the initiative, but I am, of course, speaking here in my capacity as representative of the Council, and as such I represent the position held by the Council as a whole, irrespective of any national positions.\nHowever, as many speakers have mentioned \u2013 for which I am grateful \u2013 it is also important to bear in mind that the issue of Iran\u2019s nuclear programme is not the only one that is important and fundamental to our relationship with that country, and which must be resolved if we are to improve our relations with its Government, with its President. There is also the human-rights issue. I should like to remind the House that, since 1975, Iran has been a party, without reservation, to both the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the UN International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights. Iran therefore has a clear obligation under international law to comply with the requirements of these important agreements.\nFinally, I should like to confirm that I share the opinion expressed by Mr\u00a0Brok and others that we must of course continue the dialogue with the forces in Iran who are favourably disposed to peaceful coexistence and to compliance with the country\u2019s obligations. We intend to do so; of course we are willing to engage in dialogue. It must be made quite clear, however, that we must not allow this dialogue to be abused, and so we have to be very careful in our choice of dialogue partners.

The user provided a debate summary about Iran and the international community, and they want the main points from Franco Frattini's speech. First, I need to go through the debate summary and find all mentions of Franco Frattini.\n\nLooking at the summary, there's a section under \"Nuclear Program Concerns\" where Franco Frattini is mentioned. He says that Iran needs to take visible and credible steps back to regain international confidence. Then, in the \"Human Rights and Regional Stability\" section, he's quoted about Ahmadinejad's remarks sparking global outrage and being a profound offense. \n\nI need to make sure I only include his arguments. The user specified not to include other speakers' contributions. So, the issues he raised are Iran's nuclear program and human rights issues. His position is that Iran must take steps to regain trust and that Ahmadinejad's statements are offensive. The arguments are based on needing credible steps and the offensiveness of the statements. There's no mention of proposals from him, so propSum might be empty. Let me check again. The summary mentions he supported the Russian proposal, but wait, in the \"Nuclear Program Concerns\" section, it says \"several speakers supported the Russian proposal,\" but is Franco Frattini one of them? The exact quote is \"Several speakers supported the Russian proposal...\" but the name Franco Frattini is mentioned in the same section. Wait, looking back:\n\nIn the \"Nuclear Program Concerns\" section: \"Franco Frattini argued that 'Iran needs to take visible and credible steps back in order to regain the confidence of the international community.'\" Then later, in the \"Human Rights and Regional Stability\" section: \"Franco Frattini stated that 'his unacceptable remarks regarding Israel and the Holocaust sparked global outrage. We feel that those statements are a profound offence to all of us.'\"\n\nSo his main points are about Iran's nuclear steps and the human rights issue. There's no mention of proposals from him, just his positions and arguments. So the JSON should have issueSum covering both nuclear and human rights, positionSum stating the need for steps back and the offense of remarks, argSum explaining the reasons, and propSum as empty. Wait, but the example response has propSum even if there's nothing. But the user said if no points, respond with empty string. So I need to check if he made any proposals. The debate summary doesn't mention Franco Frattini proposing anything specific, just his arguments. So propSum would be an empty string.

The user says to respond in JSON, but if there are no points, respond with an empty string. However, an empty string is not valid JSON. Maybe the user intended that if there are no points, the JSON should have empty strings for each field. But the exact instruction is ambiguous. However, looking at the example provided by the user, the response is a JSON object with the fields. So perhaps in the case of no points, the JSON should have empty strings for each key. But the user's instruction says \"respond with an empty string.\" But that's not valid JSON. Maybe the user made a mistake, but I have to follow the instructions as given. \n\nIn this case, since there's no speaker named President, the correct response is an empty JSON object. But according to the user's example, even if there's no info, the JSON structure is expected. However, the user's instruction says to respond with an empty string. But that's conflicting. To resolve this, perhaps the user intended that if there are no points, the JSON fields are empty strings.
