There are still strong doubts about the Iranians\u2019 claims that they only want to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.\nThe recent actions of Tehran, the removal of the seals placed by the International Atomic Energy Agency and the suspension of the voluntary implementation of the additional protocol on safeguards run counter to the statements of intent made by the Iranian Government and to our attempts to secure a negotiated settlement.\nOn the basis of all that, we conclude that Iran is presenting itself on the international stage as the leading authority of the Islamic revolt against the West, and that it therefore intends to assert its own military might over that of the other Muslim nations. For that reason, attacking and demonising Israel becomes a strategic move. Iran considers itself to be invincible and unassailable on the economic, industrial, financial and energy fronts, and we therefore fear that any negotiation is destined to fail.\nAs the delegation of the Forza Italia party, we therefore propose that the Iranian Minister for Foreign Affairs be invited to Brussels to take part in a meeting with our EU-Iran parliamentary delegation. We need to explain that it will not be possible to pursue a dialogue between our Parliament and the Iranian Government if the latter does not establish an equivalent parliamentary delegation.\nWe must therefore request an ongoing dialogue with all of the political forces in Iran, on both the ruling and the opposition sides, and show solidarity towards Israel with regard to the continual attacks it is under, by committing the European Union to guarantee security within the Middle East. We therefore call on Members to vote against\u00a0...\n(The President cut off the speaker)", "lang": "IT", "original": "Marcello Vernola (PPE-DE). \u2013 Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, bisogna fermare l\u2019attivit\u00e0 di arricchimento dell\u2019uranio, sulla quale non c\u2019\u00e8 sufficiente trasparenza.\nIl comportamento della dirigenza iraniana nei confronti dell\u2019Agenzia internazionale dell\u2019energia atomica non ha permesso di costruire la necessaria base di fiducia fra l\u2019Iran e la comunit\u00e0 internazionale. Rimangono tuttora forti dubbi sulle asserzioni iraniane di voler sviluppare l\u2019energia nucleare esclusivamente per scopi pacifici.\nLe recenti azioni di Teheran, la rottura dei sigilli apposti da parte dell\u2019Agenzia atomica e la sospensione dell\u2019applicazione volontaria del protocollo addizionale sulle salvaguardie sono di segno opposto rispetto alle dichiarazioni di intenti del governo del paese e ai nostri tentativi di trovare una soluzione negoziale.\nDa tutto ci\u00f2 desumiamo che l\u2019Iran si sta proponendo sul piano internazionale come l\u2019autorit\u00e0 guida della rivolta islamica contro l\u2019Occidente e intende quindi affermare la propria superiorit\u00e0 militare rispetto alle altre nazioni musulmane. Per questo motivo diventa strategico l\u2019attacco a Israele e la sua demonizzazione. L\u2019Iran si sente invincibile e inattaccabile sul piano economico, industriale, finanziario ed energetico, e temiamo quindi che qualsiasi negoziazione sia destinata a fallire.\nCome delegazione di Forza Italia proponiamo pertanto di invitare il ministro degli Affari esteri iraniano a Bruxelles per un incontro con la nostra delegazione parlamentare UE-Iran. Abbiamo bisogno di spiegare che non \u00e8 possibile costruire un dialogo fra il nostro Parlamento e il governo iraniano se il governo iraniano non istituisce una corrispondente delegazione parlamentare.\nOccorre quindi sollecitare un confronto costante con tutte le forze politiche iraniane di maggioranza e di opposizione ed esprimere solidariet\u00e0 verso Israele per i continui attacchi subiti, impegnando l\u2019Unione europea a garantire la sicurezza nell\u2019area mediorientale.
