I do not believe that these two events are coincidental. Neither do I believe that our institution can reasonably overlook the correlation between them.\nMany countries are developing their nuclear capabilities, but the international community is only worried about proliferation in those countries that pose an immediate threat to peace in the world. I believe that, if Iran does not inspire confidence in us today, it is because, amongst other things, its President makes bellicose, revisionist and anti-Semitic comments. It is that President\u2019s malevolent intentions that make the resumption of the uranium enrichment programme so worrying in terms of world peace.
