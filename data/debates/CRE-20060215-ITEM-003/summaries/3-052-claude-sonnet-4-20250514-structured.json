Iran is a country populated by people just like ourselves, with their everyday joys and cares. Our problem is not the country and its citizens. Our problem is an individual, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who became Iran\u2019s president through circumstance, and his religious fundamentalism.\nAll of the problems stem from the sick mind of this one fanatic, be it the renewal of the nuclear programme, the brutal verbal attacks against the state of Israel or the primitive and deplorable denial of the Holocaust, the greatest atrocity and genocide in human history.\nI\u00a0therefore believe that it is important to distinguish between these two elements and not to identify the president with the whole country. Unfortunately, it has been true throughout our history that such sick minds have repeatedly managed to bring war not only to their nations and countries, but often also to whole regions and twice even to the entire world. This is where the greatest danger lies.\nLadies and gentlemen, the situation is serious, though not hopeless. However, we can never defeat fundamentalism by substituting a different form of fundamentalism \u2013 that is my message to our friend George Bush. Responsibility has been vested in us, and we must act with forethought in order to make sure that one day future generations do not blame us for failing to deal with this serious situation.", "lang": "SK", "original": "Monika Be\u0148ov\u00e1 (PSE). \u2013 Domnievam sa, \u017ee probl\u00e9mom rozumne a mierovo zm\u00fd\u0161\u013eaj\u00facich \u013eud\u00ed na celom svete nie je Ir\u00e1n.
