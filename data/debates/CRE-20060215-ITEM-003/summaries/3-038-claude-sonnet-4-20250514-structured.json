Not only is the human rights situation deplorable, but the regime also mocks the world community by violating international principles and ignoring the IAEA\u2019s demands. The idea of Iran acquiring nuclear weapons is, of course, incredibly frightening, especially in the light of its statements about, and threats against, Israel and in terms of what such a development would mean for the rest of the region. The disturbances surrounding the cartoons of Muhammad also appear perfectly to suit the regime in Tehran, and there are many indications that it is precisely Tehran that is fomenting the disturbances.\nIt is time for the EU to formulate a very clear strategy in relation to Iran. It should have several different dimensions: international cooperation, clear support for dissidents and forces of democracy, such as the referendum movement, within and outside Iran, vigorous condemnation of the serious human rights violations, pressure on Iran to comply with international conventions and, of course, dialogue and diplomacy. This strategy should, however, also include preparing possible sanctions decided on in the UN Security Council.", "lang": "SV", "original": "Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m (ALDE). \u2013 Herr talman!
