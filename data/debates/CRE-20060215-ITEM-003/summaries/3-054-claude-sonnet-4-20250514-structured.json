{"speaker": "Libor Rou\u010dek (PSE).", "english": "Libor Rou\u010dek (PSE). \u2013 (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, the word most often used in this morning\u2019s debates has been the word \u2018dialogue\u2019; dialogue between cultures, between civilisations and, I may say, even between the European Union and Iran. Relations between the Union and Iran have in recent years been based on a three-tier approach, comprising trade cooperation, political dialogue and dialogue on human rights. I firmly believe, despite the numerous disappointments and setbacks of recent weeks and months, that this approach is still applicable and still valid. It is of course totally unacceptable that the Iranian president should question the existence of another state, namely Israel, and Iran cannot be allowed to develop nuclear weapons, any more than it can be allowed to circumvent international law or the rulings of international organisations. I am, however, convinced that the potential for dialogue and for a diplomatic solution has not been entirely exhausted. I am also convinced that it is not in the interests of the citizens of Iran, the Iranians themselves, that their country should become a kind of black hole within the international community. I therefore support the dialogue mentioned earlier with the reformist groups within Iran and in the surrounding region.", "lang": "CS", "original": "Libor Rou\u010dek (PSE). \u2013 D\u00e1my a p\u00e1nov\u00e9, nejpou\u017e\u00edvan\u011bj\u0161\u00edm slovem dne\u0161n\u00ed dopoledn\u00ed debaty je slovo dialog.
