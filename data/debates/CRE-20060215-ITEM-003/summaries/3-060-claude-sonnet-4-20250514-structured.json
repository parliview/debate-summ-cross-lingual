What initiatives should we adopt in connection with the Tehran regime, which is forging ahead with the construction of nuclear weapons? The European Union must adopt determined positions in order to avoid creating an explosive situation in the Middle East and in Eurasia.\nThe ayatollahs\u2019 atomic bomb is a powerful weapon with which to blackmail the Iranian people. It is a weapon used to silence the freest, most broad-minded opinions. Iranian society seems to be drowned in silence. An initiative is therefore needed to help those in Iran who fight for freedom, human rights and respect for all religious faiths and beliefs. The silence of the Iranian people does not mean that they have given in of their own accord. It will fall to them \u2013 to the men and women of Iran who have their country\u2019s best interests at heart \u2013 to defuse the mullahs\u2019 bomb. Iran and Islam are not the same; Iran and President Ahmadinejad are not the same. Therefore, the dialogue must continue and must be tightened up.\nWe are not faced with a clash of civilisations, but rather with a different attitude towards human rights, freedom and democracy.
