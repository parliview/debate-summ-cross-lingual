{"speaker": "Lu\u00eds Queir\u00f3 (PPE-DE).", "english": "Lu\u00eds Queir\u00f3 (PPE-DE). \u2013 (PT) Mr President, in spite of the international efforts, it is becoming increasingly clear that either Iran is raising the diplomatic stakes, or it really is not interested in ending the uranium enrichment programme and the subsequent use thereof for military purposes.\nToday\u2019s Iran flouts the rules of the international community, has apparently no intention of honouring those rules and poses a threat to regional and world peace. Today\u2019s Iran is potentially dangerous. Tomorrow\u2019s Iran, armed with nuclear weapons, is a definite danger.\nAgainst this backdrop, the citizens expect the EU to guarantee their security and to be a stabilising factor on the world stage. It is primarily up to those who have been given the task of leading the negotiations with Iran to dispel the citizens\u2019 fears, in spite of the risk \u2013 clearly a calculated risk \u2013 that Iran will not want to heed the international community\u2019s legitimate demands.\nMr President, simply referring the case to the United Nations and the Security Council is not, to my mind, sufficient. We believe that the EU\u2019s first task should be to strive to maintain a cohesive and resolute response among the international community to the regional and global threat posed by Iran.\nWe must not allow the current difficulties and these politically sensitive times to lead to rifts, when what is at stake is something as fundamental as our global security. Iran needs to know that the diplomatic route remains open, but also that it is up to Iran to restore trust by means of practical, verifiable moves towards the total suspension of its uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities. It must also abandon its provocative rhetoric on Israel and the holocaust, and must commit itself to a policy, acceptable to the international community, of respect for human rights and for opposition parties.\nWhat appropriate, effective measures can be taken to achieve these goals? This is the key question to which we must respond.\nMr President, it is increasingly clear that the relevance of the EU\u2019s role on the international stage depends entirely on its deeds. Let us hope that this particularly difficult time will enable the Union to show that it has the means at its disposal to play a role on a world scale, something that this House has often demanded. We hope that it succeeds in doing so.", "lang": "PT", "original": "Lu\u00eds Queir\u00f3 (PPE-DE). \u2013 Senhor Presidente, apesar dos esfor\u00e7os internacionais \u00e9 cada vez mais evidente que, ou o Ir\u00e3o est\u00e1 a elevar a sua fasquia negocial, ou n\u00e3o est\u00e1 sinceramente interessado em p\u00f4r termo ao processo de enriquecimento de ur\u00e2nio e \u00e0 sua posterior utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o militar.\nO Ir\u00e3o \u00e9 hoje um Estado que n\u00e3o respeita as regras da comunidade internacional, que n\u00e3o aparenta tencionar respeit\u00e1-las, e que se apresenta como uma amea\u00e7a para a seguran\u00e7a regional e mundial.

A resposta aos anseios dos cidad\u00e3os tem de ser dada, em primeira linha, por quem assumiu a tarefa de liderar as negocia\u00e7\u00f5es com este pa\u00eds face ao risco, certamente calculado, de o Ir\u00e3o n\u00e3o querer acatar as exig\u00eancias leg\u00edtimas da comunidade internacional.\nSenhor Presidente, a mera devolu\u00e7\u00e3o do caso \u00e0s Na\u00e7\u00f5es Unidas e ao Conselho de Seguran\u00e7a n\u00e3o \u00e9, a meu ver, suficiente. A nosso ver, a primeira tarefa da Uni\u00e3o Europeia deve ser a de contribuir para manter a comunidade internacional coesa e firme perante a amea\u00e7a que o Ir\u00e3o representa, tanto para a regi\u00e3o, como para o mundo.\nDe facto, n\u00e3o podemos permitir que as dificuldades e o momento politicamente sens\u00edvel que enfrentamos gerem cis\u00f5es, quando o que est\u00e1 em causa \u00e9 a nossa pr\u00f3pria seguran\u00e7a global. O Ir\u00e3o tem de saber que a via diplom\u00e1tica n\u00e3o est\u00e1 fechada, mas que lhe cabe restabelecer a confian\u00e7a atrav\u00e9s de actos concretos, verific\u00e1veis de suspens\u00e3o total das suas actividades de enriquecimento e reprocessamento de ur\u00e2nio. Deve igualmente abandonar o discurso provocat\u00f3rio relativamente a Israel e ao holocausto, bem como comprometer-se com uma pol\u00edtica de respeito pelos direitos humanos e pelas oposi\u00e7\u00f5es aceit\u00e1vel aos olhos da comunidade internacional.\nMas quais s\u00e3o as medidas acertadas e eficazes para se alcan\u00e7arem estes objectivos? Esta \u00e9 a quest\u00e3o fundamental a que devemos dar uma resposta.\nSenhor Presidente, a relev\u00e2ncia e o papel internacional da Uni\u00e3o Europeia dependem, cada vez mais e acima de tudo, da sua actua\u00e7\u00e3o. Esperamos que este momento, que \u00e9 um momento particularmente grave, permita \u00e0 Uni\u00e3o Europeia demonstrar que disp\u00f5e de condi\u00e7\u00f5es para desempenhar o papel que tem \u00e0 escala mundial, papel esse muitas vezes reclamado neste Parlamento.
