A nuclear-armed Iran is therefore particularly dangerous to Western security, and that of Israel in particular.\nThere is no consensus on how to deal with Iran, which is in clear breach of the NPT Treaty and its agreements with Britain, France and Germany, but I welcome the 3\u00a0February vote by the IAEA to refer Iran to the United Nations Security Council. I also welcome China and Russia\u2019s belated support.

Iran\u2019s intransigence and refusal of the reasonable Russian offer on enrichment of uranium has been a wake-up call to Russia and China. Only Syria, Cuba and Venezuela rejected the proposal. The Iranians immediately pledged to resume commercial-scale enrichment of uranium, which can be used either as a fuel for power plants or, as they really wish, in the core of an atom bomb. They have ordered an end to the unannounced visits by the IAEA inspectors.\nWestern intelligence alleges that Iran is using a network of front companies to try and buy components for missile and bomb production from western Europe and to hire impoverished nuclear scientists from the former Soviet Union. I agree with all those who say that all options must be left available to the West to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran.
