For that reason, I agree that we must act carefully when we speak about nuclear power in the region, because we could give the Iranian regime the ideal excuse to continue with its nuclear programme. Iranian leaders could be tempted to say that if Israel does not stop its nuclear programme, then Iran has the right to develop its own.\nWe have to be aware of the fact that when we are taking about the Iranian regime we are also talking about Syria and Lebanon, the future of the peace process in Israel and Palestine, theocracy and democracy, human rights and universal values.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Bernat Joan i Mar\u00ed (Verts/ALE). \u2013 Mr President, it appears that our strategy against the Iranian regime has largely failed.
