The debate on the Middle East here in Parliament and in the media has, more often than not, been focused on Iraq and the election in Palestine. Now that Iran is the subject of debate, it is the issue of nuclear weapons that is being discussed. At the same time, human rights are being violated, a state of affairs discussed by many of the previous speakers.\nAs a member of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and as Vice-Chair of Social Democratic Women in Europe, I receive very worrying reports and accounts concerning violations of both women\u2019s and children\u2019s rights. More time must be given to human rights issues, and we should act significantly more vigorously than I think we are doing at present.\nGreat changes are taking place right now in Iranian society. There are too few of us who talk of dialogue and too many of us who have got bogged down thinking in terms of a major conflict. The dialogue between the EU and Iran must be resumed. The statements about Israel are unacceptable, as are executions, death sentences and the taking of political prisoners. Diplomatic solutions must be preferred to an escalation of violence and other outrages. In modern conflicts, it is always civilians, women and children who, more than anyone else, are injured and violated.
