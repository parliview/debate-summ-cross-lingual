In January, they executed 18 people and in December 35. We sit here talking and talking while Iran goes ahead with the obvious production of nuclear weapons. Neither the US nor Israel can protect us. A military solution costing millions of lives is not an option at present. If we are to find a solution, therefore, we must understand the causes of Iran\u2019s behaviour. It would be a gross error to think that Iran is reacting out of fear or alarm. The Persians are not Arabs.\nIran ruled the Middle East in ancient times, and for five hundred years in medieval times. The country is convinced of its position as the leading power in the Middle East, and is producing nuclear weapons in order to secure this position. Its natural historical partner in this hegemony is Russia. Iran is a nation of rapidly growing, impoverished, uneducated, isolated and radicalised masses, who are kept in silence by a hard line totalitarian regime. We are not dealing with radical Islam; we are dealing with a radical totalitarian regime. Totalitarian regimes need external enemies, they need to attack the West, to block radio broadcasts and to execute their own citizens. In contrast to previous totalitarian states, the transcendental nature of Islamist ideology makes it possible that their weapons will be used. Let us support dialogue with those that care about it and those that need it. We must, however, be clear, firm and principled in our attitude towards totalitarian regimes.\n(Applause)", "lang": "EN", "original": "Jana Hyb\u00e1\u0161kov\u00e1 (PPE-DE). \u2013 ( CS ) Mr President, this morning Iran announced four more executions.
