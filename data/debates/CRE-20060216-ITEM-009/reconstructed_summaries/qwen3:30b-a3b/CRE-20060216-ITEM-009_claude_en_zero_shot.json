There is no need for me to remind you that our most direct competitors, the United States and Japan, have had detailed information about their companies\u2019 external investments for more than twenty years, and this puts their governments and economic actors at a considerable advantage compared to Europe when it comes to drawing up their strategies and commercial policies.\nThe Commission therefore considers it very desirable for Parliament and the Council to reach an agreement on this proposal for a Regulation at first reading, so that the collection of this type of data can begin this very year.

At the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, we are talking about a type of statistic that is essential to increasing the dynamism, vitality and competitiveness of European companies and economic actors.\nIn this regard, the Commission believes that the amendments that the honourable Members have presented and discussed and that are aimed at speeding up the implementation of the compilation of this data provide an excellent basis for reaching a compromise at first reading.\nNevertheless, for the same reason, the Commission does not agree that it is necessary to maintain the amendments relating to Parliament\u2019s role in implementing the Regulation, since, given its very technical nature, this kind of amendment would provide relatively little added value, while almost certainly preventing an agreement with the Council at first reading; I am referring, of course, to Amendments 1, 2 and 9, which are aimed at extending the procedures of the so-called Lamfalussy process, in relation to the legislation on financial services, to the field of the compilation of statistical data.\nThe honourable Members, and in particular the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which is also responsible for the negotiation of the directives on financial services, are in a privileged position to appreciate the differences between the two sectors.

Let me start by reading through the summary again to make sure I don't miss anything.\n\nThe debate is about statistics on foreign affiliates, specifically a regulation proposal. The speaker in question is Commissioner Joaqu\u00edn Almunia from the Commission. The user wants only the points attributed to him, not others.\n\nLooking at the \"Speaker Positions and Arguments\" section, there's a part about Almunia. The summary says he \"strongly supported swift adoption, arguing for first reading approval to begin data collection immediately.\" He also mentions that the Commission opposed amendments 1, 2, and 9 which would extend Lamfalussy-type procedures to statistical data. His reasoning was that these amendments would prevent first reading agreement and add little value because the data is technical.\n\nAdditionally, there's a quote from him: \"we are talking about a type of statistic that is essential to increasing the dynamism, vitality and competitiveness of European companies and economic actors.\" He also mentions the Commission's compromise, where they're willing to consider difficulties but not let them interfere with prompt approval.\n\nSo the main points are:\n1. Supporting swift adoption and first reading approval.\n2. Opposing specific amendments (1, 2, 9) that extend Lamfalussy procedures, arguing they hinder agreement and add little value.\n3. Emphasizing the importance of the statistics for competitiveness.\n4. The Commission's willingness to consider difficulties but prioritize prompt approval.\n\nI need to make sure I don't include anything from other speakers. For example, Enrico Letta's points about urgency and burden are separate. The user specified to only include arguments from Joaqu\u00edn Almunia. Let me check again to confirm there's no other info on him. The rest of the summary mentions other speakers, but the user wants only Almunia's points. So the answer should list those four points.\n</think>\n\nCommissioner Joaqu\u00edn Almunia argued for the swift adoption of the regulation, advocating for first reading approval to initiate data collection immediately. He emphasized that the statistics were essential for enhancing the competitiveness of European companies and economic actors. The Commission opposed amendments 1, 2, and 9, which would extend Lamfalussy-type procedures to statistical data, asserting these amendments would delay first reading agreement without significant added value due to the technical nature of the data. Almunia also highlighted the Commission\u2019s willingness to address current challenges but cautioned against allowing these issues to hinder the prompt approval of the regulation.", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Enrico Letta (ALDE),", "english": "Enrico Letta (ALDE), rapporteur . \u2013 (IT) Mr\u00a0President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the Commission and Commissioner Almunia for his speech and for the valuable work done by the two institutions during the preparatory phase leading up to this debate.\nBeyond its seemingly technical character, this directive is very important, and our aim in drafting it is to regulate two types of data on foreign affiliates, namely inward statistics, which relate to all the businesses and sectors that are under foreign control, and outward statistics, which relate to foreign enterprises that are controlled by a company located in the European Union.\nAs Commissioner Almunia said, the Commission proposes to establish a mandatory reference framework for the compilation of Community statistics on the structure and activity of foreign affiliates.\nThe Commission proposal includes two different modules for collecting inward and outward data. The module for inward FATS is based on the Structural Business Statistics Regulation, while the one for outward FATS is the same as that used for foreign direct investment in the Regulation for Balance of Payments Statistics. Whereas the provisions for inward FATS would be for the most part mandatory, the provisions for outward FATS include a voluntary experimental phase based on pilot studies aimed at assessing the feasibility and costs of collecting data.\nThe critical element for this directive is the fact that, as Commissioner Almunia just pointed out, the United States and Japan have already had this kind of information available to them for over 20 years, in even greater detail than what is provided for in the directive.\nThe Commission proposal includes pilot studies and comitology procedures with long transition periods. That is liable to leave European political officials without adequate data for a long time yet, while their US and Japanese counterparts can now already access better information on the economic strategies and trends of their own enterprises and transnational companies, including in the area of outward FATS.\nFor all these reasons, we believe that the Commission proposal must be supported, but with a few requirements taken into consideration. Firstly, the provisions of this regulation must not represent an excessive bureaucratic and financial burden for the companies involved. Secondly, it must not take too long to implement the regulation and therefore to make the data available, so that the policy makers in Europe can be on an equal footing with their US and Japanese counterparts as quickly as possible.\nThe comitology procedure, which has been widely debated within our committee as an alternative to the legislative procedure for the implementation of outward FATS, must be assessed very carefully and in the knowledge that every effort will be needed to fulfil the objective of making uniform data available in the short term.\nLastly, the European Central Bank and other institutions that are particularly in need of adequate statistical information should be involved in the development of common standards.\nOur preparatory talks before today\u2019s debate saw a divergence open up between Parliament, the Commission and the Council. We have always tried to reach a compromise that would lead as quickly as possible to the directive being approved at first reading. However, our impression that the Council did not want this text to be approved at first reading prompts us to regard the discussions held in committee on the subject of comitology as an issue that Parliament must bear in mind, particularly when the amendments on comitology are put to the vote.\nFor all these reasons, we believe that it is useful and important to recommend that this Chamber vote in favour of the directive. This is an important vote because it will succeed in making our European international trade system focus more carefully on data relating to competitiveness. From the start, our aim has been to have this directive approved at first reading. Beyond its seemingly technical character, this directive has a highly important content that prompts me to suggest to this Chamber that it vote in favour of it as soon as possible.", "lang": "IT", "original": "Enrico Letta (ALDE), relatore . \u2013 Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, desidero ringraziare la Commissione e il Commissario Almunia per il suo intervento e per il valido lavoro che le due Istituzioni hanno svolto durante la fase preparatoria di questa discussione.\nCon questa direttiva, che al di l\u00e0 della sua apparente tecnicit\u00e0 \u00e8 molto importante, desideriamo regolare due tipi di dati sulle consociate estere, vale a dire le statistiche Inward , che riguardano tutte le imprese e tutti i settori che sono sotto il controllo estero, e le statistiche Outward , relative alle aziende all\u2019estero controllate da una societ\u00e0 con sede nell\u2019Unione europea.\nCome ha detto il Commissario Almunia, la Commissione propone di stabilire un quadro di riferimento obbligatorio per la compilazione di statistiche comunitarie sulla struttura e sulle attivit\u00e0 delle consociate estere.\nLa proposta della Commissione prevede due modelli differenti per la raccolta di dati Inward e Outward. Il modello per le Inwards FATS \u00e8 basato sulla regolamentazione delle statistiche strutturali di business , mentre per le Outwards FATS ci si richiama al modello usato per gli investimenti diretti dall\u2019estero nella regolamentazione per le statistiche per la bilancia dei pagamenti. Mentre le Inward sarebbero perlopi\u00f9 obbligatorie, le disposizioni per le Outward prevedono una fase di sperimentazione volontaria attraverso studi pilota volti a stabilire la fattibilit\u00e0 dei costi della raccolta dei dati.\nL\u2019elemento di criticit\u00e0 di questa direttiva \u00e8 dato dal fatto che, come ha appena ricordato il Commissario Almunia, gli Stati Uniti e il Giappone dispongono gi\u00e0 da oltre vent\u2019anni di questo tipo di informazioni, a un livello di dettaglio ancora pi\u00f9 elevato di quello che la direttiva vuole introdurre.\nNella sua proposta la Commissione prevede studi pilota e procedure di comitatologia con periodi di transizione lunghi. Ci\u00f2 rischia di lasciare ancora per troppo tempo i responsabili politici europei senza dati adeguati, mentre le controparti americane e giapponesi possono disporre gi\u00e0 ora, anche sulle Outward , di informazioni migliori sulle strategie e sulle tendenze economiche delle proprie aziende e societ\u00e0 transnazionali.\nPer tutte queste ragioni, noi crediamo che la proposta della Commissione vada supportata, tenendo tuttavia presenti alcune esigenze. In primo luogo, le disposizioni di questa regolamentazione non devono costituire un eccessivo onere burocratico e finanziario per le imprese coinvolte. In secondo luogo, \u00e8 necessario che i tempi di applicazione della regolamentazione e, conseguentemente, di disponibilit\u00e0 dei dati non siano troppo lunghi, in modo tale da permettere ai policy makers in Europa di essere posti nel pi\u00f9 breve tempo possibile nelle medesime condizioni delle loro controparti americane e giapponesi.\nLa procedura di comitatologia, che \u00e8 stata ampiamente dibattuta all\u2019interno della nostra commissione quale alternativa alla procedura legislativa per l\u2019implementazione delle Outward FATS, deve essere valutata con molta attenzione e nella consapevolezza che l\u2019obiettivo della disponibilit\u00e0 a breve termine di dati omogenei dovr\u00e0 essere perseguito con ogni sforzo.\nInfine, la Banca centrale europea e le altre Istituzioni che sono particolarmente interessate alla disponibilit\u00e0 di informazioni statistiche adeguate dovrebbero essere coinvolte nella definizione di standard comuni.\nLa nostra discussione preparatoria al dibattito di oggi ha visto un confronto aperto tra il Parlamento, la Commissione e il Consiglio. Noi abbiamo sempre cercato di arrivare a un compromesso che portasse nel pi\u00f9 breve tempo possibile all\u2019approvazione della direttiva in prima lettura. Tuttavia, l\u2019impressione che all\u2019interno del Consiglio non ci fosse la volont\u00e0 per una conclusione positiva di questo testo in prima lettura ci spinge a valutare le discussioni che si sono tenute sul tema della comitatologia in sede di commissione come una questione che il Parlamento deve tener presente in particolare al momento della votazione degli emendamenti sulla comitatologia.\nPer tutti questi motivi credo sia utile e importante raccomandare a quest\u2019Aula di esprimere un voto favorevole alla direttiva. Si tratta di un voto importante perch\u00e9 riesce a rendere il nostro sistema europeo sul lato del commercio internazionale pi\u00f9 attento ai dati relativi alla competitivit\u00e0. Fin dall\u2019inizio noi abbiamo mirato a un\u2019approvazione in prima lettura di questa direttiva che, al di l\u00e0 della sua apparente tecnicit\u00e0, ha un contenuto di grande importanza che mi spinge a suggerire a quest\u2019Aula una votazione favorevole nei tempi pi\u00f9 rapidi possibili.", "agenda_item": "Statistics on foreign affiliates (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060216-ITEM-009", "intervention_id": "4-165", "summary_english": "{\n\"headline\": \"EU Must Catch Up to US and Japan by Implementing Statistics on Foreign Affiliates Directive to Enhance Trade Competitiveness\",\n\"issueSum\": \"The speaker addresses the need to establish mandatory Community statistics on foreign affiliates to track inward statistics (foreign-controlled businesses in EU) and outward statistics (EU-controlled foreign enterprises).

The module for inward FATS is based on the Structural Business Statistics Regulation, while the one for outward FATS is the same as that used for foreign direct investment in the Regulation for Balance of Payments Statistics. Whereas the provisions for inward FATS would be for the most part mandatory, the provisions for outward FATS include a voluntary experimental phase based on pilot studies aimed at assessing the feasibility and costs of collecting data.\nThe critical element for this directive is the fact that, as Commissioner Almunia just pointed out, the United States and Japan have already had this kind of information available to them for over 20 years, in even greater detail than what is provided for in the directive.\nThe Commission proposal includes pilot studies and comitology procedures with long transition periods. That is liable to leave European political officials without adequate data for a long time yet, while their US and Japanese counterparts can now already access better information on the economic strategies and trends of their own enterprises and transnational companies, including in the area of outward FATS.\nFor all these reasons, we believe that the Commission proposal must be supported, but with a few requirements taken into consideration. Firstly, the provisions of this regulation must not represent an excessive bureaucratic and financial burden for the companies involved. Secondly, it must not take too long to implement the regulation and therefore to make the data available, so that the policy makers in Europe can be on an equal footing with their US and Japanese counterparts as quickly as possible.\nThe comitology procedure, which has been widely debated within our committee as an alternative to the legislative procedure for the implementation of outward FATS, must be assessed very carefully and in the knowledge that every effort will be needed to fulfil the objective of making uniform data available in the short term.\nLastly, the European Central Bank and other institutions that are particularly in need of adequate statistical information should be involved in the development of common standards.\nOur preparatory talks before today\u2019s debate saw a divergence open up between Parliament, the Commission and the Council. We have always tried to reach a compromise that would lead as quickly as possible to the directive being approved at first reading. However, our impression that the Council did not want this text to be approved at first reading prompts us to regard the discussions held in committee on the subject of comitology as an issue that Parliament must bear in mind, particularly when the amendments on comitology are put to the vote.\nFor all these reasons, we believe that it is useful and important to recommend that this Chamber vote in favour of the directive. This is an important vote because it will succeed in making our European international trade system focus more carefully on data relating to competitiveness. From the start, our aim has been to have this directive approved at first reading. Beyond its seemingly technical character, this directive has a highly important content that prompts me to suggest to this Chamber that it vote in favour of it as soon as possible.", "reconstructed_position": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out the main points Enrico Letta (ALDE) made in the debate.

He supported the Commission's directive but emphasized urgency. The key points he made were that the US and Japan have had this information for over 20 years, even more detailed than the directive.

I should also like to thank Mr Almunia for the very precise clarifications that he contributed to this debate, which will certainly help us to reach a solution in time for the vote taking place not in this part-session but in the next.\nMuch has already been said about the nature and origin of this debate. Its origins lie in the proposal for a regulation on Community statistics and the structure and activity of foreign affiliates. It has been said here \u2013 and reiterated by Mr Purvis \u2013 that these statistics provide vital help to national and Community policy-makers to formulate appropriate policy and to help businesses assess ongoing developments in a business world affected by economic globalisation.\nAlthough voluntary data collection on the structure and activity of foreign affiliates \u2013 that is, inward statistics \u2013 takes place in virtually all Member States, proving that a concerted procedure is possible, the same cannot be said of outward statistics, which only occurs in a small number of Member States.\nThis information is only really useful if it is available promptly and consistently and if data collection is harmonised, hence the need to establish a common framework at the earliest opportunity.\nI agree with Mr Almunia on the importance of reaching a solution at first reading, although I also agree with Mr Purvis that it would not be a disaster if such an agreement is not obtained at first reading.\nAlthough there is a great deal of common ground, as all speakers have said, arising from the pressing and timely nature of the directive itself, there are aspects that we would normally see as upholding the comitology principle rather than the codecision procedure, but which in practice form part of what ought to be Parliament\u2019s role as regards all such procedures, in particular those of a financial nature.\nThis is what must be guaranteed. I was somewhat comforted by Mr Almunia\u2019s remarks about the changes pending to the comitology process in order to take into account the importance of Parliament\u2019s role in decision-making and monitoring these processes. It strikes me, however, that it is not entirely guaranteed. I would therefore reiterate that if it is not necessary to reach agreement at first reading, I do not think that is particularly serious given that the most important thing is that we find a sound, properly thought through, common platform from which to implement the regulation in question effectively.\nThe need to introduce improvements has also been mentioned, and my group accepts this completely. In this regard, there will not be any difficulties with either the Council or the Commission, as regards the pilot studies or periods of regulation and the deadlines to be observed for obtaining this kind of information.\nTo my mind, anything that helps to make the pilot projects mandatory, to remove from the pilot projects mandatory conclusions and to reduce periods allowed for derogations and the deadlines for establishing definitive data is of vital importance.\nWe accordingly endorse the rapporteur\u2019s proposals, the significance of which lies in the fact that they specifically address those areas.\nMy group is amply prepared to make full use of the time remaining before the final vote for us to reach an agreement, in the context of bilateral contacts, enabling this report to be adopted at first reading. I repeat, however, that I do not believe that failure to do so will lead to insurmountable obstacles.\nWe also hope that the Council, which at times during this process has struck us as being too insular, will begin to show some openness, along the lines of the openness that came through from the accommodating and significant words of Mr Almunia.\nI should like to close by once again congratulating the rapporteur.

A sua origem est\u00e1 na proposta de regulamento relativo \u00e0s estat\u00edsticas comunit\u00e1rias sobre o estatuto e as actividades das empresas estrangeiras em rela\u00e7\u00e3o de grupo. J\u00e1 aqui foi dito, tendo igualmente sido refor\u00e7ado pelo deputado Purvis, que estas estat\u00edsticas s\u00e3o absolutamente indispens\u00e1veis para ajudar os decisores pol\u00edticos nacionais e comunit\u00e1rios na elabora\u00e7\u00e3o de pol\u00edticas adequadas para as empresas, avaliando os progressos em curso num contexto de globaliza\u00e7\u00e3o econ\u00f3mica que afecta o mundo empresarial.\nEmbora a recolha volunt\u00e1ria de dados sobre a estrutura e as actividades das empresas estrangeiras, nomeadamente as estat\u00edsticas internas, esteja a funcionar em praticamente todos os Estados-Membros, o que prova a possibilidade de um procedimento concertado, j\u00e1 o mesmo n\u00e3o se verifica relativamente \u00e0s estat\u00edsticas externas, que apenas ocorre num n\u00famero limitado de Estados-Membros.\nA verdadeira utilidade que os operadores podem retirar desta informa\u00e7\u00e3o depende da sua prontid\u00e3o e da sua disponibilidade e coer\u00eancia, bem como da harmoniza\u00e7\u00e3o da recolha de dados, pelo que \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio estabelecer rapidamente um quadro comum.\nConcordo com o Comiss\u00e1rio Almunia no sentido de que \u00e9 importante encontrarmos um acordo em primeira leitura, embora tamb\u00e9m concorde com o deputado Purvis quando diz que n\u00e3o ser\u00e1 nenhum drama se n\u00e3o alcan\u00e7armos esse acordo em primeira leitura.\nApesar de haver uma ampla base de entendimento, conforme foi referido por todos os oradores, entendimento esse que resulta da pr\u00f3pria natureza da directiva e da sua imperatividade e necessidade, bem como do facto de ser oportuna neste momento, existem tamb\u00e9m aspectos que traduzimos normalmente na afirma\u00e7\u00e3o do princ\u00edpio da comitologia, em alternativa ao processo da co-decis\u00e3o, mas que na pr\u00e1tica se traduzem no papel que deve ser desempenhado pelo Parlamento Europeu relativamente a todos estes processos e, nomeadamente, aos processos de natureza financeira.\n\u00c9 isto que tem de ficar assegurado. Fiquei de algum modo confortado com as palavras do Senhor Comiss\u00e1rio quando anunciou que o pr\u00f3prio processo de comitologia vai sofrer altera\u00e7\u00f5es no sentido de tomar em linha de conta a import\u00e2ncia do Parlamento em mat\u00e9ria de decis\u00e3o e de acompanhamento destes processos. No entanto, parece-me que isso ainda n\u00e3o est\u00e1 totalmente assegurado.

Neste aspecto, n\u00e3o haver\u00e1 dificuldades nem com o Conselho nem com a Comiss\u00e3o, quer em rela\u00e7\u00e3o aos estudos-piloto ou aos per\u00edodos de regula\u00e7\u00e3o, quer aos prazos estabelecidos para obter este tipo de informa\u00e7\u00e3o.\nEm meu entender, tudo o que seja no sentido de transformar os estudos-piloto com car\u00e1cter de maior obrigatoriedade e retirar dos mesmos conclus\u00f5es de natureza obrigat\u00f3ria e tamb\u00e9m reduzir os per\u00edodos concedidos para derroga\u00e7\u00f5es e os prazos para estabelecer dados definitivos parece-me ser fundamental.\nNesse sentido, apoiamos as propostas do relator, que parecem ser importantes e significativas uma vez que apontam exactamente para estes dom\u00ednios.\nO meu grupo mostra toda a disponibilidade para aproveitar o per\u00edodo que ainda resta at\u00e9 \u00e0 vota\u00e7\u00e3o final para encontrarmos, no \u00e2mbito dos contactos bilaterais, um acordo que permita a aprova\u00e7\u00e3o deste relat\u00f3rio em primeira leitura. No entanto, reitero que se isso n\u00e3o for poss\u00edvel n\u00e3o me parece que da\u00ed resulte qualquer dificuldade insuper\u00e1vel.\nTamb\u00e9m esperamos que haja uma abertura do Conselho, que em certas fases deste processo nos pareceu demasiado fechado, na linha, ali\u00e1s, da abertura que pude verificar nas palavras do Comiss\u00e1rio Almunia, que me pareceram extremamente cooperantes e significativas.\nTermino felicitando mais uma vez o relator, que fez um excelente trabalho.

I should also like to thank Mr Almunia for the very precise clarifications that he contributed to this debate, which will certainly help us to reach a solution in time for the vote taking place not in this part-session but in the next.\nMuch has already been said about the nature and origin of this debate. Its origins lie in the proposal for a regulation on Community statistics and the structure and activity of foreign affiliates. It has been said here \u2013 and reiterated by Mr Purvis \u2013 that these statistics provide vital help to national and Community policy-makers to formulate appropriate policy and to help businesses assess ongoing developments in a business world affected by economic globalisation.\nAlthough voluntary data collection on the structure and activity of foreign affiliates \u2013 that is, inward statistics \u2013 takes place in virtually all Member States, proving that a concerted procedure is possible, the same cannot be said of outward statistics, which only occurs in a small number of Member States.\nThis information is only really useful if it is available promptly and consistently and if data collection is harmonised, hence the need to establish a common framework at the earliest opportunity.\nI agree with Mr Almunia on the importance of reaching a solution at first reading, although I also agree with Mr Purvis that it would not be a disaster if such an agreement is not obtained at first reading.\nAlthough there is a great deal of common ground, as all speakers have said, arising from the pressing and timely nature of the directive itself, there are aspects that we would normally see as upholding the comitology principle rather than the codecision procedure, but which in practice form part of what ought to be Parliament\u2019s role as regards all such procedures, in particular those of a financial nature.\nThis is what must be guaranteed. I was somewhat comforted by Mr Almunia\u2019s remarks about the changes pending to the comitology process in order to take into account the importance of Parliament\u2019s role in decision-making and monitoring these processes. It strikes me, however, that it is not entirely guaranteed. I would therefore reiterate that if it is not necessary to reach agreement at first reading, I do not think that is particularly serious given that the most important thing is that we find a sound, properly thought through, common platform from which to implement the regulation in question effectively.\nThe need to introduce improvements has also been mentioned, and my group accepts this completely. In this regard, there will not be any difficulties with either the Council or the Commission, as regards the pilot studies or periods of regulation and the deadlines to be observed for obtaining this kind of information.\nTo my mind, anything that helps to make the pilot projects mandatory, to remove from the pilot projects mandatory conclusions and to reduce periods allowed for derogations and the deadlines for establishing definitive data is of vital importance.\nWe accordingly endorse the rapporteur\u2019s proposals, the significance of which lies in the fact that they specifically address those areas.\nMy group is amply prepared to make full use of the time remaining before the final vote for us to reach an agreement, in the context of bilateral contacts, enabling this report to be adopted at first reading. I repeat, however, that I do not believe that failure to do so will lead to insurmountable obstacles.\nWe also hope that the Council, which at times during this process has struck us as being too insular, will begin to show some openness, along the lines of the openness that came through from the accommodating and significant words of Mr Almunia.\nI should like to close by once again congratulating the rapporteur. The debate in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs was most interesting. Given that the report was adopted unanimously, I feel sure that we will find an appropriate solution to the problem, in conjunction with the Council and the Commission.", "reconstructed_position": "<think>\nOkay, let's see.

The debate is about statistics on foreign affiliates, and the summary has sections on speaker positions and arguments. Let me check the part about Commissioner Joaqu\u00edn Almunia.\n\nLooking at the \"Speaker Positions and Arguments\" section, under Almunia, it says he strongly supported swift adoption, arguing for first reading approval to start data collection immediately. He emphasized that the statistics are essential for the dynamism, vitality, and competitiveness of European companies. Also, the Commission opposed amendments 1, 2, and 9 that would extend Lamfalussy-type procedures to statistical data, believing these would prevent first reading agreement and add little value because the technical nature of the data doesn't require such procedures.\n\nAdditionally, in the \"Proposed Solutions\" section, Almunia offered a compromise, saying the Commission is willing to consider difficulties but not let them interfere with prompt approval at first reading if possible. The quote from him is: \"the Commission is willing to take account of the difficulties being faced at present until that final agreement is reached, but I would also ask that these problems not interfere with the prompt approval of this Regulation, at first reading if possible.\"\n\nSo, the main points from Almunia are:\n1. Support for swift adoption and first reading approval to start data collection.\n2. Emphasis on the importance of the statistics for European competitiveness.\n3. Opposition to amendments that extend Lamfalussy procedures, considering them unnecessary and potentially delaying the process.\n4. Willingness to consider difficulties but prioritizing prompt approval.\n\nI need to make sure I don't include anything from other speakers.
