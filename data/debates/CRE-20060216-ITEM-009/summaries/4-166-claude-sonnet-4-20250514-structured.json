Firstly, the collection of these statistics is urgent and needs to be as complete as possible, as soon as possible. It is difficult to see how one can conduct meaningful trade negotiations without them. This means that the mandatory collection of statistics on both inward and outward FATS is the best solution. It is amazing to me that apparently some Member States are just not willing to consider providing them. The Council has introduced a derogation for Member States which have not yet tested this process to deal with just those situations in Article 6, point D. Is this not enough?\nBoth inward and outward FATS should therefore be collected on a mandatory basis and mandatory pilot studies should be set up for imports and exports. If not, just a few years on Member States that have not volunteered to do pilot studies will claim that it is still not necessary and will still refuse to collect the data.\nMy group\u2019s second issue is comitology, which is raising its head yet again. If Parliament\u2019s position on this means that we will have to go to a second reading, so be it. My group will stick with its position on comitology until the Council shows itself to be serious about giving the European Parliament reasonable expectations in this area. Even now, a reassuring statement by the Council might still be enough for us to reconsider our position.\nMy group will therefore vote in favour of the text that was adopted in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.", "lang": "EN", "original": "John Purvis, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . \u2013 Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Letta for his cooperation in preparing our position on this report.\nMy group is committed to two main points.
