(ES) Mr President, I simply wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Letta, and Mr Purvis and Mr dos Santos, once again for their speeches and the willingness they have shown to cooperate in order to achieve what I believe we all want to see, which is a negotiation that leads to the prompt approval of this Regulation for reasons on which we all agree: that it is important for the European institutions, in multilateral trade negotiations or any other kind of strategy, to have the data that is not available to us at present but which our competitors have been using for some time.\nWith regard to the comitology problems, which we have all mentioned, I would like to reiterate what I said in my first speech: we hope that the work of the Austrian Presidency will allow us, during this six month period, to find a solution which suits and satisfies all of us. I would therefore like to say once again that the Commission is willing to take account of the difficulties being faced at present until that final agreement is reached, but I would also ask that these problems not interfere with the prompt approval of this Regulation, at first reading if possible.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, Member of the Commission .
