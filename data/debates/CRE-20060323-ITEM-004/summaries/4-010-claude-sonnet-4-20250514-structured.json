I merely wish to take the liberty of protesting against our having this debate. At best, it can be characterised as a complete waste of time. Suddenly to agree at a few hours\u2019 or minutes\u2019 notice to debate a very important subject is clearly in breach of the Rules of Procedure. It is an important subject, but what we are now seeing is unusual complacency in a democratic context, reflected in reactions to the election in Belarus and to the oppression that has taken place. This is not a subject that can be debated at short notice. To do so is in breach of the Rules of Procedure, and I insist that we stop debating this subject and move on to the proper agenda.", "lang": "DA", "original": "Ole Krarup (GUE/NGL). - Fru formand De m\u00e5 meget undskylde, at jeg handlede i strid med de grundl\u00e6ggende regler.
