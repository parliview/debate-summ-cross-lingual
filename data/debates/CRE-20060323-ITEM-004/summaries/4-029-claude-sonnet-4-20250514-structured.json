We cannot be lenient with respect to Russia's position at any cost.\nWe have to be honest and admit that the institutions of the European Union waited too long and reacted too slowly to events in Belarus. The actions taken were slow and were not effective, not only because we did not want to annoy President Putin or because of the limited scope and resources for action, but also because of what Mr\u00a0Onyszkiewicz mentioned, namely the lengthy procedures and inappropriate channelling of the funds spent. It is the Commission's job to spend the funds earmarked for aid to Belarus appropriately and the Commission must do this job more efficiently and effectively.\nAs Members of the European Parliament, we shall regularly ask the Commission to update us on how it is carrying out its work and whether the procedure for transferring and spending the aid has been improved.\nWe shall also insist on the Council and the Commission taking a stronger position in future in condemning the support shown by Russia for the last undemocratic tyrant in Europe.", "lang": "PL", "original": "Marcin Libicki (UEN). \u2013 Dobrze, \u017ce Rada, Komisja i Parlament Europejski m\u00f3wi w sprawie sytuacji na Bia\u0142orusi jednym g\u0142osem, w dodatku po raz pierwszy a\u017c tak zdecydowanym.\nSytuacja na Bia\u0142orusi jest na tyle powa\u017cna, \u017ce r\u00f3wnie\u017c Rada i Komisja, a nie tylko pos\u0142owie do PE, musz\u0105 pot\u0119pi\u0107 rosyjsk\u0105 akceptacj\u0119 i poparcie dla niedemokratycznego re\u017cimu Aleksandra \u0141ukaszenki.
