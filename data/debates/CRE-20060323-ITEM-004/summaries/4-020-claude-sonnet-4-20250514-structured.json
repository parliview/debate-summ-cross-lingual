{"speaker": "Janusz Onyszkiewicz (ALDE). \u2013", "english": "Janusz Onyszkiewicz (ALDE). \u2013 (PL) I would also like to talk about the need for real action. We have already mentioned extending the list of people banned from entering European Union territory, but I should like to add that this list must be extended drastically and not simply by seven or eight names. It must be a list that includes hundreds of people and it should be made public in Belarus as well. The list should be signed not only by the Member States of the European Union but also by countries aspiring to European Union membership. The aim is to make sure that those who are currently persecuting the demonstrators will not be able to go on holiday to Turkey, Romania or Bulgaria. Then there is also the possibility of freezing accounts belonging to those people so that, at the very least, they could not purchase anything from us. I apologise for trivialising this issue a little, but I wanted to be very specific. There is also a third matter which is often discussed in the European Parliament and which has also featured in Parliament resolutions, namely changing the way in which Parliament acts with respect to measures taken to support civil society in Belarus and in other countries, as well as support for action in the name of democracy.\nIt is somewhat embarrassing that so few resources have been used for this action. I am not talking about the resources earmarked for the purpose, of which there have been many, but those actually used. These have been few in number due to various lengthy procedures.\nThis is why I would like to register a further appeal for the creation of some sort of fund similar to either the Westminster Foundation, one of the German foundations or those in the Netherlands, so that the process of transferring funds can be greatly improved.\nThe final thing I would like to mention is that it would be worthwhile to consider showing the Belarusians that while Mr\u00a0Lukashenko has closed off Belarus, while he does not allow educational trips or even travel for health treatment, burdening all those who travel abroad with certain border duties, the European Union could decide that for those who are eligible for an entry visa, this visa could be free of charge.
