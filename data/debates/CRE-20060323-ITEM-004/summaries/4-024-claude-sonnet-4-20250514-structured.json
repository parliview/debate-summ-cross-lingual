{"speaker": "Ryszard Czarnecki (NI). \u2013", "english": "Ryszard Czarnecki (NI). \u2013 (PL) Madam President, I was a member of the European Parliament delegation which never went to Belarus. I took on the challenge. I was stopped at the border and witnessed the whole ridiculous scene; the absurdness of the train waiting for an hour at the Polish-Belarusian border, the people looking on in horror then crossing the border, terrified. Looking at the officials inspecting passports, I was reminded of the Communist era. It was as if I was watching a film from those times. I saw petty smugglers.\nThe border on the River Bug is a ridiculous Berlin Wall and we are quite right in saying that the authorities should be isolated. However, so that we can build bridges, I would appeal for us not to isolate Belarusian society, the young people, the students, the journalists, the academics and the people working for NGOs who are already discriminated against in Belarus. We need bridges that will allow Belarusians to feel that they are Europeans, and to understand that they could and should take part in upholding values such as democracy and freedom.", "lang": "PL", "original": "Ryszard Czarnecki (NI). \u2013 Pani Przewodnicz\u0105ca!
