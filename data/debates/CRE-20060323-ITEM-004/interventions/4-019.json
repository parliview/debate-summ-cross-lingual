{"speaker": "Joseph Muscat (PSE).", "english": "Joseph Muscat (PSE). \u2013 (MT) Thank you Madam President. The brave people in October Square are writing their country\u2019s history. They are doing this because they are breaking down the wall of fear and apathy which was reigning in Belarus. This is a huge slap in the face for those who do not believe in democracy. And they are risking everything: their job, their studies, their family, their lives. In spite of the threats, since last Sunday the courageous youths of October Square were able to hold a daily vigil of courage, a vigil which will go on until next Saturday at the least. We insist that no violence is used against these people. For us this will be unacceptable. A number of these young people have been expelled from university because they are demonstrating. Now we must show in practice the solidarity which we have been talking about for so long. If things do not improve, we have to give these young people a place to study in European universities here among us. The words we have been uttering for so long have to become facts. The signal has been given and the writing is on the wall for those who want to read it. Nobody is deluding himself by anything. However, from now on, the question will be who is going to be able to resist longer. We cannot come up with excuses. We cannot hide behind bureaucratic or diplomatic obstacles in order to come to the help of these democratic forces. The initiative of broadcasting to this country is a good step in the right direction, but frankly, I do not know what has become of it. Apart from that, we must not shirk our responsibility simply because we took this initiative. What is happening in Belarus is our business because it is happening at home.

Qed jag\u0127mlu dan g\u0127ax qed ikissru l-\u0127ajt ta' bi\u017ca' u ta' apatija li kien qed jirrenja fil-Belarus. Din hija daqqa ta' \u0127arta kbira g\u0127al min ma jemminx fid-demokrazija. U qed jissugraw kollox: ix-xog\u0127ol, il-post ta' studju tag\u0127hom, il-familja, \u0127ajjithom. Minkejja t-theddid, i\u017c-\u017cg\u0127a\u017cag\u0127 qalbiena ta' Pjazza Ottubru kienu kapa\u010bi li jag\u0127mlu ta' kuljum minn nhar il-\u0126add illi g\u0127adda velja ta' kura\u0121\u0121, velja li se tkompli g\u0127addejja mill-inqas sa nhar is-Sibt li \u0121ej. Ne\u017ci\u0121u li dawn il-persuni ma tkunx u\u017cata vjolenza fuqhom. Dan ma jkunx a\u010b\u010bettabbli g\u0127alina. Numru minn dawn i\u017c-\u017cg\u0127a\u017cag\u0127 tke\u010b\u010bew mill-Universit\u00e0 g\u0127ax qed jiddimostraw. Issa rridu nuru s-solidarjet\u00e1 li tant ilna nparlaw dwarha bil-fatti. Jekk l-affarijiet ma jittran\u0121awx, lil dawn i\u017c-\u017cg\u0127a\u017cag\u0127 irridu nag\u0127tuhom post ta' studju fl-Universitajiet Ewropej biex ikomplu jistudjaw hawnhekk fostna. Il-paroli li tant ilna ng\u0127idu jridu jissarrfu f'fatti. Is-sinjal ing\u0127ata u l-kitba tinsab fuq il-\u0127ajt g\u0127al min irid jaqraha. \u0126add ma huwa qed jilludi ru\u0127u minn xi \u0127a\u0121a. Issa i\u017cda, minn issa 'l quddiem, il-kwistjoni se tkun ta' min hu kapa\u010bi li j\u017comm l-aktar sod. Ma nistg\u0127ux noqog\u0127du nin\u0127bew wara sku\u017ci. Ma nistg\u0127ux noqog\u0127du nin\u0127bew wara ostakli burokrati\u010bi jew diplomati\u010bi biex ng\u0127inu lil dawn il-forzi demokrati\u010bi. L-inizjattiva tax-xandir lejn dan il-pajji\u017c hija wa\u0127da tajba i\u017cda, frankament, ma nafx x'sar minnha.
