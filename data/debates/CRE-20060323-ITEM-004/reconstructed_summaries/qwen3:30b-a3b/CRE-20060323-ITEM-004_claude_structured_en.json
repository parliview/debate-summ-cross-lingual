For some time, the Council has viewed with concern the situation in Belarus, in terms of human rights and their suppression, of the opposition, and of civil society. Indeed, that is why the Council took a large number of measures in the run-up to the elections, including, in particular, issuing a very clear reaction to the announcement by the Belarusian Government and President of their intention to take harsh measures against any demonstrators. The word \u2018terrorists\u2019 was even used, alongside talk of the death penalty, and the Council spoke out very clearly.\nThe conduct of the elections themselves unfortunately confirmed the negative expectations we had had as a result of past events, namely the curbing of the opposition and the suppression of freedom of expression, and meant that these were not free elections: this was confirmed, in particular, by the OSCE/ODIHR election observation mission, which said that the elections were not fair or free, nor did they meet OSCE standards. The Presidency immediately took a stance on the events in Belarus, and issued a statement on the subject as early as Monday, 20\u00a0March, at the General Affairs Council. The Council discussed the matter and expressed its opinion very clearly along the same lines as the OSCE/ODIHR statement subsequently issued that afternoon.\nWhat is important now, of course, is the consequence of these events \u2013 how the EU should react. The Council believed that it was important first and foremost to react quickly and send out a signal. Once again, I am delighted at the speed with which Parliament, too, has set to work on this situation, to send out a political signal. In the days and weeks to come, the Council will carefully consider what specific measures can and should be taken to express our discontent with this situation, and also to influence future developments in the country.\nIn my opinion, this is why the situation is so difficult and why measures have to be considered carefully, because we do not want any steps we take to affect the people, or civil society. On the contrary, we must now seek to strengthen free society, or free civil society. We must look for ways to cooperate, ways to encourage the courageous people who are assembling, who are holding out there, and we must consider our further course of action. That is why the Council decided on Monday to join with the Commission for detailed deliberations on the form these measures could take.\nIt is very important that the present and future measures taken by the EU also have the support of the EU\u2019s partners. A total of 40 countries endorsed the statement issued by the Presidency yesterday afternoon: that sends out a strong signal. This statement was endorsed by the candidate countries, and also the countries participating in the stabilisation and association process \u2013 Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Montenegro \u2013 the EFTA countries Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, and also Ukraine and Moldova. It is important to arrive at a broad consensus so that we can send out a clear signal on this.\nWe shall also have to engage in dialogue with Russia, of course \u2013 herein lies another key to the events. We must make it clear that Russia, too, has to endorse the common values of the European Union, that the four areas we are always talking of in connection with the partnership with Russia presuppose that Russia, too, adheres to the rules of democracy. Naturally, we shall also express this in our contact with Russia.\nBy way of conclusion, I should like to assure you that the Council takes this situation very seriously, that we are concerned about Belarus, which is the last country in Europe where human rights are not respected, and where there is no freedom of assembly or expression. We shall continue our active endeavours to improve this situation. As the Austrian Minister for Foreign Affairs commented after the elections \u2018It will not always be winter in Minsk\u2019.", "lang": "DE", "original": "Hans Winkler, amtierender Ratspr\u00e4sident . Frau Pr\u00e4sidentin, meine sehr verehrten Damen und Herren! Es war mir ein Anliegen, heute bei dieser wichtigen Debatte hier zu sein, weil gerade auch vom Parlament ein starkes Signal dazu ausgehen muss, wie sehr wir in der Europ\u00e4ischen Union \u00fcber die Lage und die Entwicklung in Belarus besorgt sind.\nDer Rat besch\u00e4ftigt sich ja nicht erst seit vergangenem Sonntag, seit den Wahlen, mit Belarus, sondern schon seit l\u00e4ngerer Zeit. Die Situation in Belarus, die Lage und die Unterdr\u00fcckung der Menschenrechte, die Situation der Opposition, die Situation der Zivilgesellschaft haben den Rat bereits seit l\u00e4ngerer Zeit mit Sorge erf\u00fcllt. Es gibt daher auch eine ganze Reihe von Ma\u00dfnahmen, die der Rat im Vorfeld der Wahlen gesetzt hat, nicht zuletzt auch eine sehr deutliche Reaktion auf die Ank\u00fcndigung der belarussischen Regierung und auch des Pr\u00e4sidenten, mit H\u00e4rte gegen allf\u00e4llige Demonstranten vorzugehen. Da ist sogar das Wort Terrorist gefallen, von der Todesstrafe war die Rede, und wir haben uns als Rat sehr deutlich vernehmen lassen.\nDer Verlauf der Wahl selbst hat bedauerlicherweise die negativen Erwartungen, die man im Lichte der Ereignisse zuvor haben musste, n\u00e4mlich die Behinderung der Opposition und die Unterdr\u00fcckung der freien Meinungs\u00e4u\u00dferung, best\u00e4tigt und zu jenen unfreien Wahlen gef\u00fchrt, wie dies auch insbesondere die OSZE/ODIHR-Beobachtermission festgestellt hat, die ja gesagt hat, dass diese Wahlen nicht fair waren, nicht frei waren und nicht den Standards innerhalb der OSZE entsprochen haben. Die Pr\u00e4sidentschaft hat umgehend zu den Ereignissen in Belarus Stellung genommen und hat dazu schon beim Rat Allgemeine Angelegenheiten am Montag, 20. M\u00e4rz, eine Erkl\u00e4rung abgegeben. Der Rat hat das diskutiert und sich sehr deutlich im Sinne der dann am Nachmittag ver\u00f6ffentlichten Erkl\u00e4rung der OSZE/ODIHR vernehmen lassen.\nEs geht jetzt nat\u00fcrlich darum, was die Konsequenz dieser Ereignisse ist, wie sich die Europ\u00e4ische Union verhalten soll. Zun\u00e4chst war es wichtig, was den Rat betrifft, dass man rasch reagiert und ein Signal gesetzt hat. Ich begr\u00fc\u00dfe es nochmals au\u00dferordentlich, dass auch das Parlament sich sehr rasch mit dieser Situation besch\u00e4ftigt, um auch ein politisches Signal zu setzen. Der Rat wird sich in den kommenden Tagen und Wochen genau \u00fcberlegen, welche konkreten Ma\u00dfnahmen gesetzt werden sollen und k\u00f6nnen, um unsere Unzufriedenheit mit dieser Situation zum Ausdruck zu bringen, aber auch, um die zuk\u00fcnftige Entwicklung in diesem Land zu beeinflussen.\nDies begr\u00fcndet meiner Meinung nach auch die Schwierigkeit und die Notwendigkeit, sich Schritte genau zu \u00fcberlegen, denn wir wollen nicht, dass Schritte, die wir setzen, die Bev\u00f6lkerung, die Zivilgesellschaft treffen. Im Gegenteil \u2013 wir m\u00fcssen jetzt danach trachten, dass wir die freie Gesellschaft, die freie Zivilgesellschaft st\u00e4rken. Wir m\u00fcssen nach Wegen suchen, wie wir zusammenarbeiten k\u00f6nnen, wie wir den couragierten Personen, die sich hier versammeln, die hier ausharren, den R\u00fccken st\u00e4rken k\u00f6nnen, und wir m\u00fcssen \u00fcberlegen, wie wir weiter vorgehen sollen. Daher hat der Rat am Montag beschlossen, sich gemeinsam mit der Kommission eingehend zu \u00fcberlegen, wie diese Ma\u00dfnahmen aussehen k\u00f6nnen.\nEs ist sehr wichtig, dass sich auch die Partner der Europ\u00e4ischen Union den Ma\u00dfnahmen anschlie\u00dfen, die die Europ\u00e4ische Union ergreift und ergreifen wird. An der Erkl\u00e4rung, die die Pr\u00e4sidentschaft gestern Nachmittag abgegeben hat, haben sich insgesamt 40 Staaten beteiligt. Das ist ein starkes Signal. Es haben sich hier neben den Kandidatenl\u00e4ndern auch die Staaten des Stabilisierungs- und des Assoziationsprozesses Albanien, Bosnien und Herzegowina, Serbien und Montenegro, und die EFTA-Staaten Island, Liechtenstein und Norwegen angeschlossen, und auch die Ukraine sowie Moldau haben sich dieser Erkl\u00e4rung angeschlossen. Es ist wichtig, dass wir einen breiten Konsens zustande bringen, um hier ein deutliches Signal zu setzen.\nWir werden nat\u00fcrlich auch \u2013 und hier liegt auch ein Schl\u00fcssel zu den Ereignissen \u2013 mit Russland reden m\u00fcssen. Wir m\u00fcssen in aller Deutlichkeit sagen, dass auch Russland sich den gemeinsamen Werten der Europ\u00e4ischen Union anschlie\u00dfen muss, dass die vier R\u00e4ume, \u00fcber die wir in der Partnerschaft mit Russland immer wieder sprechen, voraussetzen, dass sich auch Russland an die demokratischen Spielregeln h\u00e4lt. Das werden wir selbstverst\u00e4ndlich auch in unseren Kontakten mit Russland zur Sprache bringen.\nAbschlie\u00dfend darf ich Ihnen versichern, dass wir im Rat die Situation sehr ernst nehmen, dass wir besorgt sind \u00fcber dieses Land, in dem als letztem Land in Europa die Menschenrechte noch nicht respektiert werden, wo keine Versammlungsfreiheit und keine freie Meinungs\u00e4u\u00dferung herrscht. Wir werden uns auch weiterhin intensiv mit dieser Situation mit Blickrichtung auf eine Verbesserung besch\u00e4ftigen.

The \"Positions and Arguments\" section mentions Hans Winkler's quote.

The user provided a debate summary about Belarus and wants me to focus on Ole Krarup's contributions. The instructions say to only include points attributed to him and structure the response in JSON.\n\nFirst, I need to check the debate summary. The core issues mentioned are the disputed elections, EU's response, sanctions, support for civil society, Russia's role, etc. But the user is asking about Ole Krarup from GUE/NGL. \n\nLooking through the summary, under \"Key Disagreements,\" there's a mention of Ole Krarup protesting the rushed scheduling of the debate. The exact quote is: \"Ole Krarup, who protested the rushed scheduling of the debate, arguing it was 'clearly in breach of the Rules of Procedure' and 'a complete waste of time.'\"\n\nSo, the only point attributed to him is about the debate's scheduling being rushed and violating the rules. There's no other mention of his positions, arguments, or proposals in the summary. The rest of the debate details other speakers' points, but not Krarup's. \n\nTherefore, the JSON should reflect that. The issueSum would be about the procedural objection. PositionSum is his protest against the rushed scheduling. ArgSum would be his reasoning based on breaching the Rules of Procedure. PropSum is his call for proper procedures. But wait, the user said if there are no points, return an empty string. But here, there is one point. \n\nWait, the example given in the problem has all four fields filled. But according to the instructions, if there are no points, return empty. But here, there is one point. So I need to structure the JSON with the four fields, even if some are empty? Wait, no. The user says \"if this is the case, respond with an empty string.\" But the example shows that even if there are points, you fill the JSON. So in this case, since Ole Krarup did make a point, I need to outline it.\n\nSo, issueSum: The key issue is the rushed scheduling of the debate. PositionSum: He opposed the rushed scheduling, stating it breached procedures. ArgSum: His argument was that it was a breach of the Rules of Procedure. PropSum: He considered it a waste of time. Wait, the original quote says he argued it was \"clearly in breach of the Rules of Procedure\" and \"a complete waste of time.\" So the propSum would be his proposal to follow the rules, but the summary doesn't mention any specific proposal beyond protesting. So perhaps the propSum is his call for proper procedures, but the summary doesn't have that. The summary only mentions his protest. \n\nSo the JSON should be:\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The issue raised by the speaker relates to the procedural scheduling of the debate.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"He protested the rushed scheduling of the debate, arguing it was in breach of the Rules of Procedure.\",\n\"argSum\": \"His argument was that the debate's scheduling was a clear violation of the Rules of Procedure.\",\n\"propSum\": \"He considered the rushed scheduling a complete waste of time.\"\n}\n\nBut need to check if the summary mentions any proposals. The summary says he \"protested\" and gave reasons. The \"propSum\" is about proposals or policy actions. Since he didn't propose a specific action beyond pointing out the breach, maybe propSum is empty. But the user's example includes propSum even if it's a call to action. The original quote says he \"protested\" and gave reasons. So maybe the propSum is his call for adherence to procedures. However, the summary doesn't explicitly state that. The summary only states his protest and his arguments. So perhaps the propSum is not applicable here. But according to the example, even if there's no proposal, maybe it's empty. Wait, the user said \"if there are no points, respond with empty string.\" But in this case, there are points. So the JSON should have the four fields. However, the problem is that the debate summary only mentions his protest and the reasons, not any specific proposal. So maybe \"propSum\" is empty. But the example includes \"propSum\" even if it's a call to action. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"propSum\" is his call for the debate to follow the rules. But the summary doesn't explicitly say that. It's possible that the \"propSum\" is not applicable here. But according to the user's instructions, I should only include what's attributed to the speaker. Since the summary only mentions his protest and the reasons, but not any specific proposal, perhaps \"propSum\" is empty. However, the example given by the user includes \"propSum\" even if it's a call to action. \n\nI think the correct approach is to structure the JSON with the information available. So:\n\nissueSum: The issue is the rushed scheduling of the debate.\n\npositionSum: He opposed the rushed scheduling, stating it breached the Rules of Procedure.\n\nargSum: His argument was that the scheduling was a breach of the Rules of Procedure.\n\npropSum: He considered it a waste of time, but there's no specific proposal beyond that. However, the user's example includes \"propSum\" as a proposal. Since the summary doesn't mention any proposal, maybe propSum is an empty string. But the user's example has \"He advocates for strict limitations...\" So in this case, since there's no proposal, maybe propSum is empty. \n\nBut the user's example also has \"propSum\" as a summary of any proposals. Since Ole Krarup didn't make a proposal, only a protest, then propSum would be empty. But the user's example includes \"propSum\" even if it's a call to action. However, in this case, there's no proposal. So the correct JSON would have:\n\n\"propSum\": \"\"\n\nBut I need to check the original debate summary again. The summary says: \"The only significant procedural objection came from Ole Krarup, who protested the rushed scheduling of the debate, arguing it was 'clearly in breach of the Rules of Procedure' and 'a complete waste of time.'\"\n\nSo the only points are his protest and the reasons. There's no proposal mentioned. Therefore, the \"propSum\" would be empty. But the user's example shows that even if there's no proposal, the field is included. However, the user's instruction says to respond with an empty string if there are no points. Wait, the user says: \"If this is the case, respond with an empty string.\" But in this case, there are points. So the JSON should have the four fields filled with the relevant info. However, since there's no proposal, \"propSum\" would be an empty string. \n\nSo the final JSON would be:\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The issue raised by the speaker relates to the procedural scheduling of the debate.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"He protested the rushed scheduling of the debate, arguing it was in breach of the Rules of Procedure.\",\n\"argSum\": \"His argument was that the debate's scheduling was a clear violation of the Rules of Procedure.\",\n\"propSum\": \"He considered the rushed scheduling a complete waste of time.\"\n}\n\nBut I need to check if \"propSum\" is supposed to be proposals. The user's example has \"propSum\" as \"He advocates for strict limitations...\" which is a proposal. In this case, Ole Krarup's statement that it was a \"complete waste of time\" is more of a criticism than a proposal. So maybe \"propSum\" is empty. However, the user's example includes \"propSum\" even if it's a call to action. So perhaps the answer should include \"propSum\" as his statement that it was a waste of time. But the user's instruction says \"proposals or policy actions mentioned by the speaker\". Since he didn't propose any specific action, just criticized the scheduling, maybe \"propSum\" is empty. \n\nThis is a bit ambiguous, but given the instructions, I'll proceed with the four fields, with \"propSum\" as empty if no proposal is mentioned. However, the original quote includes \"a complete waste of time\" which could be seen as a position, not a proposal. So the \"propSum\" would be empty. Therefore, the JSON would have:\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The issue raised by the speaker relates to the procedural scheduling of the debate.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"He protested the rushed scheduling of the debate, arguing it was in breach of the Rules of Procedure.\",\n\"argSum\": \"His argument was that the debate's scheduling was a clear violation of the Rules of Procedure.\",\n\"propSum\": \"\"\n}\n\nBut the user's example includes \"propSum\" even if it's a call to action.

The user provided a parliamentary debate summary about Belarus and wants the response structured in JSON based on the speaker's contributions. The speaker name given is \"President.\" \n\nFirst, I need to check the debate summary to see if the President made any contributions. Scanning through the sections, the summary mentions 22 contributions from various speakers including EU Council representatives, Commission officials, and MEPs. However, the specific names mentioned are like Hans Winkler, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs, Charles Tannock, etc. There's no mention of a \"President\" in the contributions. \n\nThe user's example response includes sections like issueSum, positionSum, etc. But since the speaker here is \"President,\" I need to verify if the President was one of the speakers in the debate. The debate summary doesn't list a President as a contributor. The speakers mentioned are officials and MEPs, but not a President. \n\nTherefore, since there are no points attributed to the \"President\" in the provided debate summary, the correct response is an empty JSON object. The user's instructions state that if there are no points, respond with an empty string. However, the example shows a JSON structure. But according to the problem statement, if no arguments, return an empty string. But the user also says to respond in JSON. Wait, the user says: \"If this is the case, respond with an empty string.\" But the example shows a JSON. Hmm, maybe the user wants an empty JSON object.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says: \"You must respond in json format. Outputs must be parseable by json.loads(). You will structure your response as json with the following structure... If this is the case, respond with an empty string.\"\n\nBut an empty string is not a JSON object. However, maybe the user expects an empty JSON object {} in that case. But the example shows a filled JSON. So perhaps when there are no points, return an empty JSON. But the user says \"respond with an empty string\". But JSON can't be an empty string. Maybe the user made a mistake, but according to the problem statement, if no points, return empty string. However, the user also says to respond in JSON. This is conflicting.\n\nBut looking at the example given by the user, the example response is a JSON object. So perhaps when there are no points, the correct response is an empty JSON object. So in this case, since the President isn't mentioned as a speaker, the answer is {}.\n\nSo the final answer is an empty JSON object.\n</think>\n\n{}", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs,", "english": "L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs, Member of the Commission .

I think it is also right and proper that the European Union should spell this out quite clearly and let our public know that we do not accept that a dictatorship should continue its grip on that country through elections of that kind.\nThat, of course, begs the question what we should do next. I share Mr Klich\u2019s view that we need to look into how we can go on extending what we call smart sanctions.\nWe believe it makes no sense to develop sanctions that affect the people of that country; the most important thing we should do for them is to see if we can help raise awareness or make more room for pluralism in that country.\nI think that the Council and Commission need to make it clear how that regime, after these elections, is to be characterised, and that we should use the same harsh words to describe it as the US. At least, there is then no doubt as to what we think of it.\nI think that we should also look into the option of extending the role of the High Representative. Why not, indeed, appoint a special EU representative for Belarus?\nAs Mr Winkler said a moment ago, one core issue is, of course, the relationship with Russia. It is all well and good to have 40 signatures under an EU declaration \u2013 very good indeed \u2013 but one signature is missing. That signature is at the bottom of a telegram which Mr Putin sent Mr Lukashenko as early as Sunday, I believe, to congratulate him once again on the fantastic outcome, in which Mr Putin expresses the hope that he, together with Mr Lukashenko, can work on both countries\u2019 further democratic development.\nThat is the situation we are facing. I hope that these issues will be raised at the G8 summit, but also maybe, and mainly, in the framework of the regular consultation between the European Union and Russia. I think it is of crucial importance for the EU to join forces with neighbouring countries such as Ukraine, but also with the United States, in order to further develop policy with a view to bringing about change in the country in question.\nI also think that a more visible policy on our part would pay off at the moment. There has been so much media attention in all our countries about these elections that we should make use of the momentum it has created.\nFinally, we will be holding a more extensive debate on this issue in Strasbourg in two weeks\u2019 time, where we may be able to discuss in greater detail the action that the European Union could take, and so I would like to ask the Council one thing, and that is to present a sound programme and sound proposals to support the opposition and civil society in that country. I think that is really important: to look for more ways of giving the opposition the support that it needs and deserves, and it is probably the only way of securing change in that country.

Ik denk ook dat het de Europese Unie past om dat ook helder en duidelijk te zeggen en ons publiek duidelijk te maken dat we niet accepteren dat zich in dat land via dit soort verkiezingen een dictatuur handhaaft.\nDan rijst natuurlijk de vraag wat te doen. Ik sluit me aan bij wat collega Klich gezegd heeft met betrekking tot de noodzaak om te bezien hoe we verder kunnen gaan met het uitbreiden van wat wij slimme sancties noemen.\nWij denken ook dat het geen zin heeft om sancties te ontwikkelen die de bevolking van het land raken. Wat we met die bevolking vooral moeten doen, is kijken of we haar kunnen helpen op het gebied van een verdere bewustwording of door meer ruimte te maken voor pluralisme in het land.\nIk denk dat het aan de Raad en de Commissie is om heel helder en duidelijk te maken hoe we dat regime na deze verkiezingen karakteriseren en dat we het in even harde bewoordingen moeten beschrijven als de Amerikanen. Dan is in ieder geval op zijn minst duidelijk wat wij van dat regime vinden.\nIk denk ook dat we zouden kunnen kijken of de rol van de hoge vertegenwoordiger kan worden uitgebreid. Waarom niet ook een speciaal vertegenwoordiger van de Europese Unie voor Wit-Rusland?\nEen kernpunt is natuurlijk, de heer Winkler heeft daar al naar verwezen, de relatie met Rusland. Het is mooi om 40 handtekeningen te hebben onder een verklaring van de Europese Unie, hartstikke goed, maar \u00e9\u00e9n handtekening ontbreekt. Die staat wel onder een telegram dat de heer Poetin geloof ik zondag al naar de heer Loekasjenko heeft gestuurd, om hem nogmaals te feliciteren met de fantastische uitslag, waarbij de heer Poetin hoopt dat hij in de toekomst samen met de heer Loekasjenko aan de verdere democratische ontwikkeling van beide landen kan werken.\nDat is de situatie waarmee we te maken hebben. Ik hoop dat deze zaken op de bijeenkomst van de G8, maar misschien vooral in het kader van het reguliere overleg tussen de Europese Unie en Rusland aan de orde worden gesteld. Ik denk dat het van immens belang is dat de EU samenwerkt met buurlanden als Oekra\u00efne, maar ook met de Verenigde Staten, als het gaat om het verder ontwikkelen van beleid om te zorgen voor verandering in het land waar we het over hebben.\nIk denk ook dat een meer zichtbare beleid van de Europese Unie op dit moment op vruchtbare bodem terecht zou komen. Er is in de media in al onze landen heel veel aandacht aan deze verkiezingen besteed. Van dat momentum zouden we ook gebruik moeten maken.\nTot slot dan. We zullen over deze kwestie nog een uitgebreider debat houden over twee weken in Straatsburg, waar we misschien wat uitgebreider kunnen ingaan op de maatregelen die de Europese Unie zou kunnen ontwikkelen. Ik wil daarbij \u00e9\u00e9n ding vragen aan de Raad en dat is om met een goed programma te komen, met goede voorstellen om de oppositie en de civiele maatschappij in het land te ondersteunen. Ik denk dat dat van groot belang is: zoeken naar meer mogelijkheden om met name de oppositie te steunen. Die heeft dat nodig, die verdient dat en het is waarschijnlijk ook de enige weg vooruit, naar een verandering in het land.

The user provided a parliamentary debate summary about Belarus and wants the main points from Charles Tannock's speech. First, I need to look through the debate summary and find any mentions of Charles Tannock.\n\nLooking at the \"Positions and Arguments\" section, there's a mention of Charles Tannock describing Belarus as \"saddled with a paranoid, self-isolating dictator, Mr Lukashenko.\" That's his position. The issue here is the political situation in Belarus, specifically the regime under Lukashenko. \n\nNow, the user wants only the points attributed to Tannock. The summary doesn't mention any other arguments or proposals from him. The other parts of the debate talk about sanctions, civil society support, etc., but those are from other speakers. So, for Tannock, the issue is the authoritarian regime, his position is calling Lukashenko a dictator, and there's no argument or proposal specific to him beyond that. \n\nI need to structure this into the JSON format. The issueSum would be the political situation in Belarus. PositionSum is his description of Lukashenko. ArgSum and propSum might be empty since there's no further arguments or proposals mentioned for him. Wait, the example response has argSum even if brief. But in the debate summary, there's no additional argument from Tannock beyond his position. So maybe argSum is empty. Similarly, propSum would be empty. Let me check the original debate summary again to confirm. \n\nYes, the only thing mentioned about Tannock is his position. So the JSON should reflect that. The user also said if there are no points, return an empty string. But here, there is one position.

In spite of the threats, since last Sunday the courageous youths of October Square were able to hold a daily vigil of courage, a vigil which will go on until next Saturday at the least. We insist that no violence is used against these people. For us this will be unacceptable. A number of these young people have been expelled from university because they are demonstrating. Now we must show in practice the solidarity which we have been talking about for so long. If things do not improve, we have to give these young people a place to study in European universities here among us. The words we have been uttering for so long have to become facts.

It must be a list that includes hundreds of people and it should be made public in Belarus as well. The list should be signed not only by the Member States of the European Union but also by countries aspiring to European Union membership. The aim is to make sure that those who are currently persecuting the demonstrators will not be able to go on holiday to Turkey, Romania or Bulgaria. Then there is also the possibility of freezing accounts belonging to those people so that, at the very least, they could not purchase anything from us. I apologise for trivialising this issue a little, but I wanted to be very specific. There is also a third matter which is often discussed in the European Parliament and which has also featured in Parliament resolutions, namely changing the way in which Parliament acts with respect to measures taken to support civil society in Belarus and in other countries, as well as support for action in the name of democracy.\nIt is somewhat embarrassing that so few resources have been used for this action. I am not talking about the resources earmarked for the purpose, of which there have been many, but those actually used. These have been few in number due to various lengthy procedures.\nThis is why I would like to register a further appeal for the creation of some sort of fund similar to either the Westminster Foundation, one of the German foundations or those in the Netherlands, so that the process of transferring funds can be greatly improved.\nThe final thing I would like to mention is that it would be worthwhile to consider showing the Belarusians that while Mr\u00a0Lukashenko has closed off Belarus, while he does not allow educational trips or even travel for health treatment, burdening all those who travel abroad with certain border duties, the European Union could decide that for those who are eligible for an entry visa, this visa could be free of charge.

First, I need to look through the debate summary and find any mentions of him.\n\nLooking at the \"Proposed Solutions\" section, there's a part about targeted sanctions. The summary mentions Janusz Onyszkiewicz proposed that the list of sanctioned individuals must be extended drastically, not just by seven or eight names, but to include hundreds. \n\nNow, the user's instructions say to only include points attributed to the specified speaker. The other sections like positions, arguments, etc., might not have info on him. The debate summary doesn't mention him in other parts. So, the only relevant part is his proposal about expanding sanctions. \n\nI need to structure this into the JSON fields. The issueSum would be about targeted sanctions. PositionSum is his stance on expanding the sanctions list. The argument is probably about targeting more people, and the proposal is the extension. Wait, the example given has argSum as the reasoning. But in the debate summary, it just states his proposal without explaining the reasoning. So maybe the argSum is missing here. But the user said if there's no info, return empty. However, the proposal is there. So, I'll fill propSum with his proposal. The other fields might be empty since the summary doesn't detail his position or arguments beyond the proposal. Let me check again. The summary says he \"proposed that 'this list must be extended drastically...'\". So the position is supporting extending sanctions, the argument is to target more people, and the proposal is the extension. But the original debate summary doesn't explicitly state his reasoning. So maybe the argSum is empty. But the example shows that argSum is a summary of arguments used to justify positions. Since the debate summary doesn't provide reasoning, perhaps those fields are empty.

As a result, the two parties will be given the status of PPE-DE observer members at the Congress to be held in Rome next week.\nThirdly, the European Union, particularly the Commission, should draw up a new strategy that is clear, more effective and more consistent. We must not allow EU financial support to be channelled through the Lukashenko administration where we have no control over how it is used. The Slovak Republic is in favour of stricter and tougher procedures.\nLadies and gentlemen, the European Union must not leave Lukashenko alone and revert to a \u2018business as usual\u2019 policy \u2013 as the most important trading partner of Belarus, the EU has in fact been contributing in no small measure to the preservation of this regime.", "lang": "SK", "original": "\u00c1rp\u00e1d Duka-Z\u00f3lyomi (PPE-DE). \u2013 Zn\u00e1my v\u00fdsledok prezidentsk\u00fdch volieb v\u00a0Bielorusku sa dal o\u010dak\u00e1va\u0165.

The wave of repressions will not abate, but increase; therefore, the first object is to protect the forces opposed to the regime and their leaders from repression.

We all agree on this. Naturally, we intend to follow many of the recommendations made here.\nSince I cannot go into detail on all the points raised, I should like to discuss those that I find particularly interesting in this context. Mr\u00a0Klich reminded the House that Alexander Milinkevich visited Parliament; I should like to point out that Mr\u00a0Milinkevich has also visited the Council \u2013 at all events, 14\u00a0Foreign Ministers were present for that discussion, which was held within the framework of a Council meeting, and there, too, we made very clear the depth of our admiration for the courage of the opposition and the strength of our support.\nSeveral speakers here have mentioned restrictive measures, or sanctions. That is exactly what we need now. Visa restrictions are already in place, and these restrictive measures must now be extended. Mrs\u00a0Schroedter said that a visa ban should be imposed on everyone responsible, and that is exactly what we need. That is also the reason why \u2013 even though, naturally, scenarios have already been considered in the past \u2013 we are only now able to take specific measures: because we now know exactly who is responsible for the situation in Belarus and which names should appear on the list of visa restrictions \u2013 although a detailed analysis is still required.\nAs many speakers have said, at the same time, we must find ways of offering assistance to people who wish to travel abroad, to visit our countries, to broaden their minds, to see how democracy works. I am also much obliged to Commissioner\u00a0Kov\u00e1cs for taking a specific stance on the measures planned by the Commission, as it will also be important that the Commission, with our full support, develop credible, coherent programmes.\nSmart sanctions have been mentioned. Indeed, that is exactly what we need, although, to be quite honest, I must say that it is often easier said than done to find exactly the kind of measures that do not hit the wrong people.\nAttention has also been drawn to the EU observers who were denied access. That is a most regrettable state of affairs. I should like to point out that the Presidency declaration on the situation in Belarus that was issued yesterday expressly deplored the non-admittance of EU observers, including Members of the European Parliament. That only goes to prove the depth of the fear of allowing free parliamentarians into the county.\nIt is indeed our duty to support the young people, civil society, those people who are still holding out despite sub-zero temperatures, and we shall join with the Commission in seeking ways of doing so.\nMr\u00a0Kami\u0144ski mentioned the free media, which play a most important role. That is indeed important. We all know from past experience \u2013 and, as an Austrian, I am in a particularly good position to judge \u2013 the importance of the role played by independent radio and television in our neighbours Hungary and Czechoslovakia at one time. In the present day, too, we must ensure that those interested in doing so have the opportunity to receive news free from censorship and control.

Ich darf darauf verweisen, dass in der gestern ver\u00f6ffentlichten Pr\u00e4sidentschaftserkl\u00e4rung zur Situation in Belarus ausdr\u00fccklich bedauert wurde, dass Beobachter der EU einschlie\u00dflich der Vertreter des Europ\u00e4ischen Parlaments nicht zugelassen worden sind.

In der Tat, darum geht es.

The user provided a parliamentary debate summary about Belarus and wants the main points from Alessandro Battilocchio's speech. First, I need to look through the debate summary and find any mentions of him.\n\nLooking at the \"Positions and Arguments\" section, there's a mention of Alessandro Battilocchio characterizing Lukashenko as \"Europe's last remaining tyrant.\" That's his position. The issue here is the political situation in Belarus, specifically the regime's nature. The argument he makes is that Lukashenko is a tyrant, which supports the broader condemnation of the regime. However, the summary doesn't mention any specific proposals or solutions from him. The other sections like \"Russia's Role\" or \"Proposed Solutions\" don't attribute anything to him. So, the issue is the regime's tyranny, his position is calling Lukashenko a tyrant, the argument is part of the unanimous condemnation, and there's no proposal mentioned. So the JSON should reflect that.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The political situation in Belarus following disputed presidential elections, particularly the nature of President Lukashenko's regime.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"Characterized President Lukashenko as 'Europe's last remaining tyrant', emphasizing the authoritarian nature of his rule.\",\n\"argSum\": \"Supported the broader consensus that the elections were illegitimate and highlighted the need to address the oppressive regime.\",\n\"propSum\": \"\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Marcin Libicki (UEN). \u2013", "english": "Marcin Libicki (UEN). \u2013 (PL) It is laudable that the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament are speaking with one voice on the issue of Belarus and that they are doing this so forcefully for the first time.\nThe situation in Belarus is serious enough for the Council and the Commission, as well as the Members of the European Parliament, to condemn the Russian acceptance of and support for the undemocratic regime of Aleksander Lukashenko.
