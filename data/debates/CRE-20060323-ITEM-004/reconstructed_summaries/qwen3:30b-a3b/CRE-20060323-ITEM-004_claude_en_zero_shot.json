The user provided a detailed summary of a parliamentary debate about Belarus after the 2006 elections. They want me to outline the main points of the speaker named \"President.\" But wait, in the debate summary, the speakers mentioned are Hans Winkler (Council President), L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs (Commission), and others from different groups. The user specified \"President\" as the speaker, but in the context, the Council President is Hans Winkler. Maybe the user is referring to him as \"President\"?\n\nLooking at the summary, under \"Institutional Positions,\" there's a section for the Council Position by Hans Winkler. The user might have meant him. However, the user wrote \"President\" instead of his name. But according to the instructions, I need to focus only on the speaker named. If the actual speaker's name isn't \"President\" but the user inputted that, maybe there's a mistake. However, the user's instruction says to include only the points attributed to the speaker named. If the speaker's name in the debate isn't \"President,\" but the user input says \"President,\" then there might be no points. But in the debate summary, the Council President is Hans Winkler. Maybe the user intended him but made a typo. However, according to the strict instructions, if the speaker's name isn't matching, I should return an empty string. But I need to check if \"President\" is actually a speaker in the debate. Looking through the summary, the speakers listed are Hans Winkler, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs, Bogdan Klich, Jan Marinus Wiersma, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, Elisabeth Schroedter, Kami\u0144ski, Tannock, Onyszkiewicz, Szyma\u0144ski, Muscat, Pavilionis, Libicki. No one is referred to as \"President\" except maybe the Council President, but his name is Hans Winkler. So if the user's input is \"President,\" but the actual speaker's name isn't that, then there are no points. However, maybe the user is referring to the Council President's contribution. But according to the instructions, I should only include points from the exact speaker name given. Since the user wrote \"President,\" and in the debate summary, the Council President is Hans Winkler, but the user didn't mention his name, perhaps there's a misunderstanding. But the user might have intended Hans Winkler as the \"President.\" However, the user's instruction says to only include arguments from the speaker named. If the speaker's name in the debate isn't \"President,\" then the answer is empty. But maybe in the original debate, the President of the European Council at the time was Hans Winkler, so maybe the user is referring to him as \"President.\" But without explicit confirmation, I should stick to the given name. Since the user wrote \"President,\" and the debate summary doesn't list a speaker by that title, the answer would be an empty string. However, the user might have made a mistake. But according to the strict instructions, if the speaker's name isn't in the debate, then there's nothing to report. So the answer is an empty string.\n</think>\n\n\"President\" is not explicitly identified as a speaker in the provided debate summary. The key institutional figures mentioned are Hans Winkler (Council President) and L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs (Commission), but no contribution is attributed to a speaker named \"President\" in the text.

For some time, the Council has viewed with concern the situation in Belarus, in terms of human rights and their suppression, of the opposition, and of civil society. Indeed, that is why the Council took a large number of measures in the run-up to the elections, including, in particular, issuing a very clear reaction to the announcement by the Belarusian Government and President of their intention to take harsh measures against any demonstrators. The word \u2018terrorists\u2019 was even used, alongside talk of the death penalty, and the Council spoke out very clearly.\nThe conduct of the elections themselves unfortunately confirmed the negative expectations we had had as a result of past events, namely the curbing of the opposition and the suppression of freedom of expression, and meant that these were not free elections: this was confirmed, in particular, by the OSCE/ODIHR election observation mission, which said that the elections were not fair or free, nor did they meet OSCE standards. The Presidency immediately took a stance on the events in Belarus, and issued a statement on the subject as early as Monday, 20\u00a0March, at the General Affairs Council. The Council discussed the matter and expressed its opinion very clearly along the same lines as the OSCE/ODIHR statement subsequently issued that afternoon.\nWhat is important now, of course, is the consequence of these events \u2013 how the EU should react. The Council believed that it was important first and foremost to react quickly and send out a signal. Once again, I am delighted at the speed with which Parliament, too, has set to work on this situation, to send out a political signal. In the days and weeks to come, the Council will carefully consider what specific measures can and should be taken to express our discontent with this situation, and also to influence future developments in the country.\nIn my opinion, this is why the situation is so difficult and why measures have to be considered carefully, because we do not want any steps we take to affect the people, or civil society. On the contrary, we must now seek to strengthen free society, or free civil society. We must look for ways to cooperate, ways to encourage the courageous people who are assembling, who are holding out there, and we must consider our further course of action. That is why the Council decided on Monday to join with the Commission for detailed deliberations on the form these measures could take.\nIt is very important that the present and future measures taken by the EU also have the support of the EU\u2019s partners. A total of 40 countries endorsed the statement issued by the Presidency yesterday afternoon: that sends out a strong signal. This statement was endorsed by the candidate countries, and also the countries participating in the stabilisation and association process \u2013 Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Montenegro \u2013 the EFTA countries Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, and also Ukraine and Moldova. It is important to arrive at a broad consensus so that we can send out a clear signal on this.\nWe shall also have to engage in dialogue with Russia, of course \u2013 herein lies another key to the events. We must make it clear that Russia, too, has to endorse the common values of the European Union, that the four areas we are always talking of in connection with the partnership with Russia presuppose that Russia, too, adheres to the rules of democracy. Naturally, we shall also express this in our contact with Russia.\nBy way of conclusion, I should like to assure you that the Council takes this situation very seriously, that we are concerned about Belarus, which is the last country in Europe where human rights are not respected, and where there is no freedom of assembly or expression. We shall continue our active endeavours to improve this situation. As the Austrian Minister for Foreign Affairs commented after the elections \u2018It will not always be winter in Minsk\u2019.", "lang": "DE", "original": "Hans Winkler, amtierender Ratspr\u00e4sident . Frau Pr\u00e4sidentin, meine sehr verehrten Damen und Herren! Es war mir ein Anliegen, heute bei dieser wichtigen Debatte hier zu sein, weil gerade auch vom Parlament ein starkes Signal dazu ausgehen muss, wie sehr wir in der Europ\u00e4ischen Union \u00fcber die Lage und die Entwicklung in Belarus besorgt sind.\nDer Rat besch\u00e4ftigt sich ja nicht erst seit vergangenem Sonntag, seit den Wahlen, mit Belarus, sondern schon seit l\u00e4ngerer Zeit. Die Situation in Belarus, die Lage und die Unterdr\u00fcckung der Menschenrechte, die Situation der Opposition, die Situation der Zivilgesellschaft haben den Rat bereits seit l\u00e4ngerer Zeit mit Sorge erf\u00fcllt. Es gibt daher auch eine ganze Reihe von Ma\u00dfnahmen, die der Rat im Vorfeld der Wahlen gesetzt hat, nicht zuletzt auch eine sehr deutliche Reaktion auf die Ank\u00fcndigung der belarussischen Regierung und auch des Pr\u00e4sidenten, mit H\u00e4rte gegen allf\u00e4llige Demonstranten vorzugehen. Da ist sogar das Wort Terrorist gefallen, von der Todesstrafe war die Rede, und wir haben uns als Rat sehr deutlich vernehmen lassen.\nDer Verlauf der Wahl selbst hat bedauerlicherweise die negativen Erwartungen, die man im Lichte der Ereignisse zuvor haben musste, n\u00e4mlich die Behinderung der Opposition und die Unterdr\u00fcckung der freien Meinungs\u00e4u\u00dferung, best\u00e4tigt und zu jenen unfreien Wahlen gef\u00fchrt, wie dies auch insbesondere die OSZE/ODIHR-Beobachtermission festgestellt hat, die ja gesagt hat, dass diese Wahlen nicht fair waren, nicht frei waren und nicht den Standards innerhalb der OSZE entsprochen haben. Die Pr\u00e4sidentschaft hat umgehend zu den Ereignissen in Belarus Stellung genommen und hat dazu schon beim Rat Allgemeine Angelegenheiten am Montag, 20. M\u00e4rz, eine Erkl\u00e4rung abgegeben. Der Rat hat das diskutiert und sich sehr deutlich im Sinne der dann am Nachmittag ver\u00f6ffentlichten Erkl\u00e4rung der OSZE/ODIHR vernehmen lassen.\nEs geht jetzt nat\u00fcrlich darum, was die Konsequenz dieser Ereignisse ist, wie sich die Europ\u00e4ische Union verhalten soll. Zun\u00e4chst war es wichtig, was den Rat betrifft, dass man rasch reagiert und ein Signal gesetzt hat. Ich begr\u00fc\u00dfe es nochmals au\u00dferordentlich, dass auch das Parlament sich sehr rasch mit dieser Situation besch\u00e4ftigt, um auch ein politisches Signal zu setzen. Der Rat wird sich in den kommenden Tagen und Wochen genau \u00fcberlegen, welche konkreten Ma\u00dfnahmen gesetzt werden sollen und k\u00f6nnen, um unsere Unzufriedenheit mit dieser Situation zum Ausdruck zu bringen, aber auch, um die zuk\u00fcnftige Entwicklung in diesem Land zu beeinflussen.\nDies begr\u00fcndet meiner Meinung nach auch die Schwierigkeit und die Notwendigkeit, sich Schritte genau zu \u00fcberlegen, denn wir wollen nicht, dass Schritte, die wir setzen, die Bev\u00f6lkerung, die Zivilgesellschaft treffen. Im Gegenteil \u2013 wir m\u00fcssen jetzt danach trachten, dass wir die freie Gesellschaft, die freie Zivilgesellschaft st\u00e4rken. Wir m\u00fcssen nach Wegen suchen, wie wir zusammenarbeiten k\u00f6nnen, wie wir den couragierten Personen, die sich hier versammeln, die hier ausharren, den R\u00fccken st\u00e4rken k\u00f6nnen, und wir m\u00fcssen \u00fcberlegen, wie wir weiter vorgehen sollen. Daher hat der Rat am Montag beschlossen, sich gemeinsam mit der Kommission eingehend zu \u00fcberlegen, wie diese Ma\u00dfnahmen aussehen k\u00f6nnen.\nEs ist sehr wichtig, dass sich auch die Partner der Europ\u00e4ischen Union den Ma\u00dfnahmen anschlie\u00dfen, die die Europ\u00e4ische Union ergreift und ergreifen wird. An der Erkl\u00e4rung, die die Pr\u00e4sidentschaft gestern Nachmittag abgegeben hat, haben sich insgesamt 40 Staaten beteiligt. Das ist ein starkes Signal. Es haben sich hier neben den Kandidatenl\u00e4ndern auch die Staaten des Stabilisierungs- und des Assoziationsprozesses Albanien, Bosnien und Herzegowina, Serbien und Montenegro, und die EFTA-Staaten Island, Liechtenstein und Norwegen angeschlossen, und auch die Ukraine sowie Moldau haben sich dieser Erkl\u00e4rung angeschlossen. Es ist wichtig, dass wir einen breiten Konsens zustande bringen, um hier ein deutliches Signal zu setzen.\nWir werden nat\u00fcrlich auch \u2013 und hier liegt auch ein Schl\u00fcssel zu den Ereignissen \u2013 mit Russland reden m\u00fcssen. Wir m\u00fcssen in aller Deutlichkeit sagen, dass auch Russland sich den gemeinsamen Werten der Europ\u00e4ischen Union anschlie\u00dfen muss, dass die vier R\u00e4ume, \u00fcber die wir in der Partnerschaft mit Russland immer wieder sprechen, voraussetzen, dass sich auch Russland an die demokratischen Spielregeln h\u00e4lt. Das werden wir selbstverst\u00e4ndlich auch in unseren Kontakten mit Russland zur Sprache bringen.\nAbschlie\u00dfend darf ich Ihnen versichern, dass wir im Rat die Situation sehr ernst nehmen, dass wir besorgt sind \u00fcber dieses Land, in dem als letztem Land in Europa die Menschenrechte noch nicht respektiert werden, wo keine Versammlungsfreiheit und keine freie Meinungs\u00e4u\u00dferung herrscht. Wir werden uns auch weiterhin intensiv mit dieser Situation mit Blickrichtung auf eine Verbesserung besch\u00e4ftigen.

Let me start by looking through the document again to find any mentions of him.\n\nThe user mentioned that the debate was about the political situation in Belarus after the elections, and there were 17 speakers plus procedural interventions. The key sections here are the \"Institutional Positions\" part. Under that, there's a section for the Council Position (Hans Winkler) and the Commission Position (L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs). \n\nLooking at the Council Position, it says: \"The Council President outlined a comprehensive response strategy emphasizing that 'we do not want any steps we take to affect the people, or civil society.

The Council committed to targeted sanctions while building international consensus, noting that 40 countries endorsed their condemnation statement.\"\n\nSo Hans Winkler, as the Council President, is talking about a response strategy. His main points here are about targeted sanctions, building international consensus, and ensuring that the actions don't harm the people or civil society. He wants to strengthen free society. The mention of 40 countries endorsing the condemnation statement shows that he's focusing on international cooperation.\n\nI need to make sure I don't include anything from other speakers. The user specified that only the points attributed to Hans Winkler should be included. The rest of the summary talks about other groups and individuals, but I need to stick strictly to what's mentioned under his section.\n\nSo the main points are:\n1. Comprehensive response strategy.\n2. Emphasis on not affecting the people or civil society, instead strengthening free society.\n3. Targeted sanctions.\n4. Building international consensus, with 40 countries endorsing the condemnation.\n\nI should present these as the key arguments made by Hans Winkler. There's no other information about him in the summary, so that's all I can include.\n</think>\n\nHans Winkler, as the Council President, emphasized a comprehensive response strategy to the fraudulent elections in Belarus, focusing on **targeted sanctions** against the regime while avoiding harm to the general population or civil society. He stressed the importance of **strengthening free society** and building **international consensus**, noting that 40 countries had endorsed the EU's condemnation statement.

No Ole Krarup is mentioned here.\n\nSo, the answer would be an empty string because there's no information provided about Ole Krarup's contributions.

The user provided a detailed summary of a parliamentary debate about Belarus after the 2006 elections. They want me to outline the main points made by the speaker named \"President.\" But wait, in the debate summary, the speakers mentioned are Hans Winkler (Council President), L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs (Commission), and others from different groups. The \"President\" here might refer to Hans Winkler, as he's the Council President. But the user specified \"President\" as the speaker name. Let me check the summary again.\n\nLooking at the \"Institutional Positions\" section, the Council Position is outlined by Hans Winkler, who is referred to as the Council President. The Commission Position is by L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs. The user's query is about the \"President,\" which could be Winkler. However, the user might have a different context. But in the given data, there's no other \"President\" mentioned. The user might have made a mistake, but I need to stick to the provided info.\n\nThe task is to list the main points attributed to the speaker named \"President.\" If there's no such speaker, return an empty string. But in the summary, the Council President is Hans Winkler. However, the user might have intended \"President\" as a role, not a person's name. But the user's instruction says \"the name of a speaker,\" so maybe \"President\" is the title. However, in the debate, the speakers are listed with their names and groups. The only \"President\" mentioned is Hans Winkler as Council President. But the user's query is about the speaker named \"President,\" which might not be a real name. Maybe it's a mistake, but I have to go with the info given.\n\nIf there's no speaker named \"President\" in the provided debate summary, then the answer is an empty string. However, if \"President\" refers to Hans Winkler, then his points are: the Council's response strategy, emphasizing not affecting the people, strengthening civil society, targeted sanctions, and building international consensus with 40 countries endorsing the condemnation. But the user might have intended a different name. Since the user's input says \"Speaker Name: President,\" but in the summary, the Council President is Hans Winkler, perhaps the user meant him. However, without explicit confirmation, maybe the answer is empty. But the user might expect that \"President\" refers to Winkler. This is a bit ambiguous. However, according to the strict instructions, if the speaker's name isn't in the summary, return empty. Since the summary doesn't have a speaker named \"President\" but has \"Council President\" Hans Winkler, maybe the answer is empty. But maybe the user intended \"President\" as the role. This is tricky. To be safe, check if \"President\" is a speaker. The summary lists 17 speakers plus procedural interventions. The names mentioned are Hans Winkler, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs, Bogdan Klich, Jan Marinus Wiersma, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, Elisabeth Schroedter, Kami\u0144ski, Tannock, Onyszkiewicz, Szyma\u0144ski, Muscat, Pavilionis, Libicki.

It seems that, for the first time in a long while, Parliament and the Commission are speaking the same language. This is a very good sign.\nThe Belarusians are expecting an expression of political solidarity from us. This is something for which Aleksander Milinkevich appealed when he made an appearance before Parliament a few months ago. He met Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner and Mr Solana and was acknowledged as a democratic partner by the political leaders of the European Union. Political solidarity is not just about making political declarations but also involves the need to revise the policies of our Union. This far-reaching revision process should aim to isolate the authorities in power without isolating Belarusian society. It should aim to support Belarusian society without supporting the authorities.\nThis House has long called for the actions taken by the Union to be intelligent and to introduce only those sanctions which will affect the regime\u2019s officials, those responsible for the infringement of civil rights and democratic freedoms.

The decision to include this item on the agenda reflects very positively on the European Parliament. The speech made by the Commissioner today also reflects well on the European Commission. It seems that, for the first time in a long while, Parliament and the Commission are speaking the same language. This is a very good sign.\nThe Belarusians are expecting an expression of political solidarity from us. This is something for which Aleksander Milinkevich appealed when he made an appearance before Parliament a few months ago. He met Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner and Mr Solana and was acknowledged as a democratic partner by the political leaders of the European Union. Political solidarity is not just about making political declarations but also involves the need to revise the policies of our Union. This far-reaching revision process should aim to isolate the authorities in power without isolating Belarusian society. It should aim to support Belarusian society without supporting the authorities.\nThis House has long called for the actions taken by the Union to be intelligent and to introduce only those sanctions which will affect the regime\u2019s officials, those responsible for the infringement of civil rights and democratic freedoms. We call for the list of those who are banned from entering the EU to be significantly extended. As the European Parliament delegation to Belarus, we have submitted the relevant document to Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner and Mr Solana. It is also very important to open the gates of the European Union to those Belarusians who cannot find a place in their own country, and it is vital to include the youth of Belarus who are currently excluded from universities for taking part in peace demonstrations in a special grant programme in the EU Member States. We owe this to our Belarusian partners.", "reconstructed_position": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out the main points that Bogdan Klich made in the parliamentary debate about Belarus.

I think it is also right and proper that the European Union should spell this out quite clearly and let our public know that we do not accept that a dictatorship should continue its grip on that country through elections of that kind.\nThat, of course, begs the question what we should do next. I share Mr Klich\u2019s view that we need to look into how we can go on extending what we call smart sanctions.\nWe believe it makes no sense to develop sanctions that affect the people of that country; the most important thing we should do for them is to see if we can help raise awareness or make more room for pluralism in that country.\nI think that the Council and Commission need to make it clear how that regime, after these elections, is to be characterised, and that we should use the same harsh words to describe it as the US.

I hope that these issues will be raised at the G8 summit, but also maybe, and mainly, in the framework of the regular consultation between the European Union and Russia. I think it is of crucial importance for the EU to join forces with neighbouring countries such as Ukraine, but also with the United States, in order to further develop policy with a view to bringing about change in the country in question.\nI also think that a more visible policy on our part would pay off at the moment. There has been so much media attention in all our countries about these elections that we should make use of the momentum it has created.\nFinally, we will be holding a more extensive debate on this issue in Strasbourg in two weeks\u2019 time, where we may be able to discuss in greater detail the action that the European Union could take, and so I would like to ask the Council one thing, and that is to present a sound programme and sound proposals to support the opposition and civil society in that country.

Ik denk ook dat het de Europese Unie past om dat ook helder en duidelijk te zeggen en ons publiek duidelijk te maken dat we niet accepteren dat zich in dat land via dit soort verkiezingen een dictatuur handhaaft.\nDan rijst natuurlijk de vraag wat te doen. Ik sluit me aan bij wat collega Klich gezegd heeft met betrekking tot de noodzaak om te bezien hoe we verder kunnen gaan met het uitbreiden van wat wij slimme sancties noemen.\nWij denken ook dat het geen zin heeft om sancties te ontwikkelen die de bevolking van het land raken. Wat we met die bevolking vooral moeten doen, is kijken of we haar kunnen helpen op het gebied van een verdere bewustwording of door meer ruimte te maken voor pluralisme in het land.\nIk denk dat het aan de Raad en de Commissie is om heel helder en duidelijk te maken hoe we dat regime na deze verkiezingen karakteriseren en dat we het in even harde bewoordingen moeten beschrijven als de Amerikanen. Dan is in ieder geval op zijn minst duidelijk wat wij van dat regime vinden.\nIk denk ook dat we zouden kunnen kijken of de rol van de hoge vertegenwoordiger kan worden uitgebreid. Waarom niet ook een speciaal vertegenwoordiger van de Europese Unie voor Wit-Rusland?\nEen kernpunt is natuurlijk, de heer Winkler heeft daar al naar verwezen, de relatie met Rusland. Het is mooi om 40 handtekeningen te hebben onder een verklaring van de Europese Unie, hartstikke goed, maar \u00e9\u00e9n handtekening ontbreekt. Die staat wel onder een telegram dat de heer Poetin geloof ik zondag al naar de heer Loekasjenko heeft gestuurd, om hem nogmaals te feliciteren met de fantastische uitslag, waarbij de heer Poetin hoopt dat hij in de toekomst samen met de heer Loekasjenko aan de verdere democratische ontwikkeling van beide landen kan werken.\nDat is de situatie waarmee we te maken hebben. Ik hoop dat deze zaken op de bijeenkomst van de G8, maar misschien vooral in het kader van het reguliere overleg tussen de Europese Unie en Rusland aan de orde worden gesteld. Ik denk dat het van immens belang is dat de EU samenwerkt met buurlanden als Oekra\u00efne, maar ook met de Verenigde Staten, als het gaat om het verder ontwikkelen van beleid om te zorgen voor verandering in het land waar we het over hebben.\nIk denk ook dat een meer zichtbare beleid van de Europese Unie op dit moment op vruchtbare bodem terecht zou komen. Er is in de media in al onze landen heel veel aandacht aan deze verkiezingen besteed. Van dat momentum zouden we ook gebruik moeten maken.\nTot slot dan. We zullen over deze kwestie nog een uitgebreider debat houden over twee weken in Straatsburg, waar we misschien wat uitgebreider kunnen ingaan op de maatregelen die de Europese Unie zou kunnen ontwikkelen. Ik wil daarbij \u00e9\u00e9n ding vragen aan de Raad en dat is om met een goed programma te komen, met goede voorstellen om de oppositie en de civiele maatschappij in het land te ondersteunen. Ik denk dat dat van groot belang is: zoeken naar meer mogelijkheden om met name de oppositie te steunen.

It has had a terrible history, suffering particularly badly from the fallout from Chernobyl. Indeed, I was one of the authors of an amendment in the last Parliament to increase the funding to help the children who are still suffering the consequences of the radioactivity to date.\nBelarus is now saddled with a paranoid, self-isolating dictator, Mr Lukashenko. I described the country as the \u2018Cuba of Europe\u2019. Mr Lukashenko has no time for fair and free elections. He goes through the charade only. He believes in the Stalinist saying that it does not matter how the voting is conducted, but who controls the count. Bizarrely, Mr Lukashenko may even have had sufficient popular support \u2013 55\u00a0to 60% \u2013 to have won the vote in a free election. However, that was not enough for a man like him: he wanted a much larger margin of a majority as a dictator, because he would fear that, if he were to become more unpopular, next time round there would be no comfort zone in which to retreat back to 55% or 60%.\nRegrettably, Russia, under Mr Putin, supplies gas to Belarus at USD\u00a050 per thousand cubic metres and the Belarus economy is rosy enough for Mr Lukashenko to be able to buy the votes of pensioners, the military, the police and all the apparatus of the state. Fortunately, the young are more cynical and I salute the courage of all those who have taken to the streets in protest and faced the brutality and the wrath of the militia and the KGB under Mr Lukashenko.\nAt the end of the day, Mr Lukashenko should be considered a pariah in the West and travel bans and financial assets must be tightened up on all the members of the regime: they must be frozen.

The debate summary has sections about different speakers and their contributions. Let me scan through each part.\n\nIn the \"Russia Factor\" section, there's a mention of Tannock. The summary says: \"Tannock noted that Russia 'supplies gas to Belarus at USD 50 per thousand cubic metres' enabling the regime to 'buy the votes of pensioners, the military, the police and all the apparatus of the state' [Tannock, 2006-03-23].\" \n\nSo that's the only direct quote from Tannock.

The user wants only the arguments from Tannock. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other mention. Let me check again. The \"Parliamentary Group Positions\" section mentions PPE-DE Group (Bogdan Klich), but Tannock is part of PPE-DE. However, the specific contributions listed under PPE-DE are from Klich, not Tannock. The other sections like \"Proposed Actions\" and \"Civil Society Support\" don't mention Tannock. \n\nSo the only point is the one about Russia supplying gas at a low price to the regime. That's the main argument from Tannock. The user wants the main points or arguments made by him. Since there's only one, I should present that. \n\nI need to structure it as a list, but since the user says \"outline the main points or arguments,\" and there's only one, I'll state that.

We have already mentioned extending the list of people banned from entering European Union territory, but I should like to add that this list must be extended drastically and not simply by seven or eight names. It must be a list that includes hundreds of people and it should be made public in Belarus as well. The list should be signed not only by the Member States of the European Union but also by countries aspiring to European Union membership. The aim is to make sure that those who are currently persecuting the demonstrators will not be able to go on holiday to Turkey, Romania or Bulgaria. Then there is also the possibility of freezing accounts belonging to those people so that, at the very least, they could not purchase anything from us. I apologise for trivialising this issue a little, but I wanted to be very specific. There is also a third matter which is often discussed in the European Parliament and which has also featured in Parliament resolutions, namely changing the way in which Parliament acts with respect to measures taken to support civil society in Belarus and in other countries, as well as support for action in the name of democracy.\nIt is somewhat embarrassing that so few resources have been used for this action. I am not talking about the resources earmarked for the purpose, of which there have been many, but those actually used. These have been few in number due to various lengthy procedures.\nThis is why I would like to register a further appeal for the creation of some sort of fund similar to either the Westminster Foundation, one of the German foundations or those in the Netherlands, so that the process of transferring funds can be greatly improved.\nThe final thing I would like to mention is that it would be worthwhile to consider showing the Belarusians that while Mr\u00a0Lukashenko has closed off Belarus, while he does not allow educational trips or even travel for health treatment, burdening all those who travel abroad with certain border duties, the European Union could decide that for those who are eligible for an entry visa, this visa could be free of charge.

We have already mentioned extending the list of people banned from entering European Union territory, but I should like to add that this list must be extended drastically and not simply by seven or eight names. It must be a list that includes hundreds of people and it should be made public in Belarus as well. The list should be signed not only by the Member States of the European Union but also by countries aspiring to European Union membership. The aim is to make sure that those who are currently persecuting the demonstrators will not be able to go on holiday to Turkey, Romania or Bulgaria. Then there is also the possibility of freezing accounts belonging to those people so that, at the very least, they could not purchase anything from us. I apologise for trivialising this issue a little, but I wanted to be very specific. There is also a third matter which is often discussed in the European Parliament and which has also featured in Parliament resolutions, namely changing the way in which Parliament acts with respect to measures taken to support civil society in Belarus and in other countries, as well as support for action in the name of democracy.\nIt is somewhat embarrassing that so few resources have been used for this action. I am not talking about the resources earmarked for the purpose, of which there have been many, but those actually used. These have been few in number due to various lengthy procedures.\nThis is why I would like to register a further appeal for the creation of some sort of fund similar to either the Westminster Foundation, one of the German foundations or those in the Netherlands, so that the process of transferring funds can be greatly improved.\nThe final thing I would like to mention is that it would be worthwhile to consider showing the Belarusians that while Mr\u00a0Lukashenko has closed off Belarus, while he does not allow educational trips or even travel for health treatment, burdening all those who travel abroad with certain border duties, the European Union could decide that for those who are eligible for an entry visa, this visa could be free of charge.

Firstly, we must not accept the election results.

As a result, the two parties will be given the status of PPE-DE observer members at the Congress to be held in Rome next week.\nThirdly, the European Union, particularly the Commission, should draw up a new strategy that is clear, more effective and more consistent. We must not allow EU financial support to be channelled through the Lukashenko administration where we have no control over how it is used. The Slovak Republic is in favour of stricter and tougher procedures.\nLadies and gentlemen, the European Union must not leave Lukashenko alone and revert to a \u2018business as usual\u2019 policy \u2013 as the most important trading partner of Belarus, the EU has in fact been contributing in no small measure to the preservation of this regime.", "lang": "SK", "original": "\u00c1rp\u00e1d Duka-Z\u00f3lyomi (PPE-DE). \u2013 Zn\u00e1my v\u00fdsledok prezidentsk\u00fdch volieb v\u00a0Bielorusku sa dal o\u010dak\u00e1va\u0165.

The outcome reflects the use of violence, fraud and mass arrest, in other words, gross violations of the basic rules that govern free and democratic elections. How will the situation evolve now, after the elections? It looks as if one chapter in the struggle for democracy in Belarus has come to a close, but we must not remain inactive. People have been protesting on the streets of Minsk for five days now.\nWhat can we in the European Parliament and the European Union do under the circumstances? Firstly, we must not accept the election results. This means we must reject, ignore and isolate the Belarus president from the rest of the world.\nSecondly, the European Union and the European Parliament must henceforth unambiguously support only the democratic opposition forces and citizens' associations, or civil society, as has already been suggested here. This support should be expressed not only in moral terms but should be specific and include financial assistance. Integrating Belarus opposition parties into European party structures might also be an effective step. The SMK [Hungarian Coalition Party] in Slovakia set a good example in signing an agreement with the Belarus National Front and the United Civic Party last year, and at the same time, the SMK is advancing this issue within the PPE-DE. As a result, the two parties will be given the status of PPE-DE observer members at the Congress to be held in Rome next week.\nThirdly, the European Union, particularly the Commission, should draw up a new strategy that is clear, more effective and more consistent. We must not allow EU financial support to be channelled through the Lukashenko administration where we have no control over how it is used. The Slovak Republic is in favour of stricter and tougher procedures.\nLadies and gentlemen, the European Union must not leave Lukashenko alone and revert to a \u2018business as usual\u2019 policy \u2013 as the most important trading partner of Belarus, the EU has in fact been contributing in no small measure to the preservation of this regime.", "reconstructed_position": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out what \u00c1rp\u00e1d Duka-Z\u00f3lyomi from the PPE-DE group said in the debate.

Wir sind uns hier einig. Wir haben selbstverst\u00e4ndlich vor, viele der Anregungen, die hier gemacht worden sind, in die Tat umzusetzen.\nDa ich nicht auf alle Punkte eingehen kann, m\u00f6chte ich auf diejenigen eingehen, die mir hier besonders interessant erscheinen. Herr Klich hat daran erinnert, dass Alexander Milinkewitsch hier im Parlament empfangen wurde. Ich darf daran erinnern, dass Alexander Milinkewitsch auch im Rat empfangen worden ist \u2013 es waren immerhin 14\u00a0Au\u00dfenminister bei dieser Aussprache anwesend, die im Rahmen einer Ratstagung stattgefunden hat, und wir haben auch dort sehr deutlich gemacht, wie sehr wir die Opposition f\u00fcr ihren Mut bewundern und auch unterst\u00fctzen.\nVon mehreren Rednern hier wurden restriktive Ma\u00dfnahmen, Sanktionen angesprochen. Genau das ist es, worum es jetzt geht. Es hat bisher schon Visarestriktionen gegeben und es wird nun darum gehen, diese restriktiven Ma\u00dfnahmen auszuweiten. Frau Schroedter hat gesagt, dass alle Verantwortlichen mit einem Visabann belegt werden sollen. Genau darum geht es. Das war auch der Grund, warum wir zwar selbstverst\u00e4ndlich schon vorher \u00fcber Szenarien nachgedacht haben, aber erst jetzt konkrete Ma\u00dfnahmen setzen k\u00f6nnen, weil wir jetzt genau wissen \u2013 und es bedarf noch einer genauen Analyse\u00a0\u2013, wer in Belarus f\u00fcr die Situation verantwortlich ist und wer auf dieser Liste von Visarestriktionen stehen soll.\nGleichzeitig \u2013 und das wurde von vielen Rednern gesagt \u2013 m\u00fcssen wir Wege finden, um die Menschen, die ins Ausland reisen wollen, die zu uns kommen wollen, die sich bilden wollen, die erleben wollen, wie Demokratie funktioniert, unterst\u00fctzen zu k\u00f6nnen. Ich bin auch Herrn Kommissar Kov\u00e1cs sehr dankbar, dass er ganz konkret zu den von der Kommission geplanten Ma\u00dfnahmen Stellung genommen hat, denn hier wird es auch darum gehen, dass die Kommission, die unsere volle Unterst\u00fctzung hat, glaubw\u00fcrdige und koh\u00e4rente Programme entwickelt.\nIntelligente Sanktionen wurden genannt. Ja, genau darum geht es, obwohl ich ganz ehrlich gestehen muss: Es ist oft einfacher gesagt als getan, wenn es darum geht, genau jene Richtung von Ma\u00dfnahmen zu finden, die eben nicht die Falschen trifft.\nEs wurde hier auch auf die EU-Beobachter hingewiesen, die nicht zugelassen worden sind. Das ist etwas, was wir sehr bedauern. Ich darf darauf verweisen, dass in der gestern ver\u00f6ffentlichten Pr\u00e4sidentschaftserkl\u00e4rung zur Situation in Belarus ausdr\u00fccklich bedauert wurde, dass Beobachter der EU einschlie\u00dflich der Vertreter des Europ\u00e4ischen Parlaments nicht zugelassen worden sind. Das beweist nur, wie sehr man Angst hat, freie Parlamentarier ins Land zu lassen.\nDie Unterst\u00fctzung der jungen Leute, der b\u00fcrgerlichen Gesellschaft, die Unterst\u00fctzung jener, die jetzt noch bei Temperaturen unter Null Grad ausharren, ist in der Tat unsere Aufgabe, und wir werden gemeinsam mit der Kommission hier nach Wegen suchen.\nHerr Kami\u0144ski hat die Rolle der freien Medien zur Sprache gebracht, die eine ganz wichtige Rolle spielen. In der Tat, darum geht es.

Let me start by looking at the debate summary provided. The user mentioned that the task is to outline the main points or arguments made by the specified speaker, which in this case is Hans Winkler. \n\nFirst, I'll check the sections of the summary where Hans Winkler is mentioned. The summary has a section titled \"Institutional Positions\" with two parts: Council Position (Hans Winkler) and Commission Position (L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs). \n\nUnder the Council Position, it says: \"The Council President outlined a comprehensive response strategy emphasizing that 'we do not want any steps we take to affect the people, or civil society. On the contrary, we must now seek to strengthen free society, or free civil society' [Winkler, 2006-03-23]. The Council committed to targeted sanctions while building international consensus, noting that 40 countries endorsed their condemnation statement.\"\n\nSo from this, Hans Winkler's main points are:\n\n1. The Council's response strategy focuses on not affecting the people or civil society, instead aiming to strengthen free society.\n2. The Council is committed to targeted sanctions.\n3. They are building international consensus, with 40 countries supporting their condemnation statement.\n\nI need to make sure there are no other mentions of Hans Winkler elsewhere in the summary. Let me scan through the other sections. The other parts talk about other speakers like Bogdan Klich, Jan Marinus Wiersma, etc. The Russia Factor section mentions Kami\u0144ski and Tannock. The Proposed Actions section has Onyszkiewicz, Szyma\u0144ski, etc. The Civil Society Support section has Muscat and Pavilionis. The Consensus and Critique section mentions Kami\u0144ski again, Libicki, etc. \n\nNo other mentions of Hans Winkler. So the only points are the ones under the Council Position. The user specified not to include arguments from other speakers, so even if there are other points in the summary, if they're not attributed to Winkler, they shouldn't be included. \n\nTherefore, the answer should list the three points mentioned above. The user also said if there are no points, respond with an empty string, but in this case, there are three points. I need to present them clearly, probably in bullet points or as a numbered list. The example response uses bullet points, so I'll follow that format.\n</think>\n\n- The Council's response strategy emphasized avoiding actions that harm the people or civil society, instead focusing on strengthening free society.  \n- The Council committed to implementing targeted sanctions against those responsible for the fraudulent elections.  \n- International consensus was highlighted, with 40 countries endorsing the condemnation statement.", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs,", "english": "L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs, Member of the Commission .
