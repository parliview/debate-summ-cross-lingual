{"speaker": "James Hugh Allister (NI). \u2013", "english": "James Hugh Allister (NI). \u2013 Mr President, it seems to me that on occasions the Commission\u2019s policy on State aid has proved to be a blunt, inflexible and at times inappropriately directed instrument, which has often discouraged rather than facilitated economic development. I therefore question whether a further assault on State aid is justified in pursuit of the failing Lisbon Agenda.\nHowever, the specific issue I wish to focus on is regional aid. I welcome the fact that the present regional aid guidelines, as they affect my constituency of Northern Ireland, are a marked improvement from earlier drafts, and that the Commission has listened to representations from myself and others. The new draft guidelines provide for continued distinctive treatment of Northern Ireland as an economic development region and therefore allow ongoing aid to attract inward foreign investment on a reducing scale through to 2011.\nHaving to compete with a 12.5% corporation tax south of the border in Ireland, the capacity for Northern Ireland to give aid to attract foreign investment is absolutely indispensable. It is exactly such local realities that the Commission needs to reflect more and more on the implementation of what is too often rigid dogma on State aid and indeed on other policies affecting the European Union.", "lang": "EN", "original": "James Hugh Allister (NI). \u2013 Mr President, it seems to me that on occasions the Commission\u2019s policy on State aid has proved to be a blunt, inflexible and at times inappropriately directed instrument, which has often discouraged rather than facilitated economic development.
