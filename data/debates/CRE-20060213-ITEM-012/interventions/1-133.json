On the one hand, it is naturally in our interest to make sure that State aid provided in individual Member States does not undermine the natural competitive environment. On the other hand, it gives me great pleasure that in its action plan for State aid reform the Commission has taken into consideration the fact that it is essential to strengthen the European Union by means of promoting the knowledge-based economy, something we have been demanding for so long.\nIn my contribution, I\u00a0would particularly like to emphasise innovation, research and development, areas closely associated with access to venture capital. These are areas where public funding may be usefully applied, generating high rates of return in the form of sustainable development and the increased competitiveness of the European economy, primarily for small and medium-sized enterprises.\nThe model of public and private partnerships establishing research and development centres, technology incubators and high-tech centres where universities have an important role, as well as local and regional authorities and third sector institutions, may contribute significantly to greater transparency over the use of public funds and, at the same time, help better tap the research, technological and innovation potential of individual member countries. The same applies to venture capital funds. Without public funds, it is almost impossible to set up the seed capital funds that innovative start-up businesses need so badly. State aid policy must in no way restrain their development. On the contrary, it should encourage and attract sufficient private capital funding. I trust that State aid reform will meet such requirements.", "lang": "EN", "original": "J\u00e1n Hudack\u00fd (PPE-DE). \u2013 ( SK) I would first like to thank the rapporteur, Mr H\u00f6kmark, for his excellent and well-balanced report, with many ideas on how State aid policy should be consistently evaluated and implemented.
