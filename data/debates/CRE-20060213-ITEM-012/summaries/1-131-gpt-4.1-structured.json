{"speaker": "David Casa (PPE-DE).", "english": "David Casa (PPE-DE). \u2013 (MT) Thank you, Mr President. I too wish to join my colleagues in thanking Mr\u00a0H\u00f6kmark for all the excellent work he has done to enable this report to be finalised today. The subject of State aid is one on which there is definitely a lot of room for discussion. This is because it directly concerns all 25 Member States. It is good to ask where we want the reform to take us and to see what has led to the need for this kind of reform. When the preliminary decisions taken by the Commission between February 2004 and the present day are examined thoroughly and compared with the Lisbon Strategy and the conclusions of the 2002 Barcelona European Summit, it is evident that it would be much more productive if State aid were more direct and designed to meet these same objectives. Thus, I think that we should work towards having a system that is as simple as possible and, therefore, more effective and more transparent. This will be an indispensable instrument because it will eliminate unnecessary bureaucracy that, until now, has not only led to more money being wasted but has prevented State aid from bringing about progress and made it less suited to the purpose for which it was intended. We need better to protect the use of State aid so that funds are delivered to where they are needed and not, as previously used to happen, squandered to no good purpose. We have to reach a position where the State has clear aims, involving the proportionality principle, concerning where it wants to use its aid. We must not forget that these funds are subsidised by all taxpayers, so we want them to be used wisely and responsibly so that they are more productive and their effects still more keenly felt. We must not forget companies that have logistical problems as a result of being based in disadvantaged regions, for example companies on an island such as Gozo. Once again, I wish to thank our rapporteur for his work.", "lang": "MT", "original": "David Casa (PPE-DE). \u2013 Grazzi Sur President, jien ukoll nixtieq ma' s\u0127abi nirringrazzja lis-Sur H\u00f6kmark g\u0127ax xog\u0127ol kollu li g\u0127amel biex dan ir-rapport seta' jkun finalizzat illum b'mod mill-aktar e\u010b\u010bellenti.
