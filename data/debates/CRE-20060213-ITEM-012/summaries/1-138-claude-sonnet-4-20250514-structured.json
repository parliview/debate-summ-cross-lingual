{"speaker": "Paolo Cirino Pomicino (PPE-DE). \u2013", "english": "Paolo Cirino Pomicino (PPE-DE). \u2013 (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the same way that our rapporteur is a sensible man, this proposal for a resolution is a sensible balance between various opinions and fulfils a core requirement of the European Union, which has been stuck in a rut of low and uncompetitive growth for far too long.\nThe Prodi Commission always looked upon State aid as the enemy of competition and of the single market. Sadly, that was a one-sided and distorted outlook, which often meant that less of that rightful public support went to strategic economic sectors, such as research and innovation, or to the vital cohesion policy. In contrast, the Barroso Commission seems to take a different view, and the resolution approved by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs provides some guidelines from which the Commission ought not to deviate.\nNone of us opposes competition. Nevertheless, this basic value in the market economy has often been subject to the ideologies of bureaucrats and economists lacking in any political responsibility, to the extent that, in the real economy, they have been responsible for delaying the recovery of competitiveness in entire regions of the European Union.\nAs Mr\u00a0Pittella has already stated, we must start a new chapter today by reconciling competition with cohesion policies. To this end, advantageous tax conditions, for instance, are useful because they can contribute positively to the cohesion policies and because, in the absence of any tax harmonisation among the Member States, they constitute a vital instrument in the hands of national governments where tackling regional underdevelopment is concerned.\nI therefore want to make just one recommendation to Mrs\u00a0Kroes: that she drafts a new proposal for a directive as quickly as possible. This proposal should \u2013 if not exclusively, then mainly \u2013 take account of Parliament\u2019s guidelines, given that the crisis the Union is grappling with is completely subsumed by the Council\u2019s crisis and by its inability, for example, to deal with the unequal way in which the Member States\u2019 markets are deregulated, a situation that is far more damaging to competition than any misguided State aid is.", "lang": "IT", "original": "Paolo Cirino Pomicino (PPE-DE). \u2013 Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, signora Commissario, la proposta di risoluzione in esame \u00e8 un punto di saggio equilibrio \u2013 come saggio \u00e8 il nostro relatore \u2013 tra opinioni diverse e coglie un\u2019esigenza profonda dell\u2019Unione europea, da troppo tempo ferma al palo di una crescita bassa e poco competitiva.\nLa Commissione Prodi ha sempre guardato agli aiuti di Stato come a un nemico della concorrenza e del mercato unico. Si \u00e8 trattato di una visione purtroppo parziale e distorta, che spesso ha fatto venir meno quel legittimo sostegno pubblico a settori economici strategici, quali la ricerca e l\u2019innovazione nonch\u00e9 la necessaria politica di coesione. La Commissione Barroso sembra invece respirare un\u2019aria diversa e la risoluzione approvata dalla commissione per i problemi economici e monetari fornisce alcune linee guida dalle quali la Commissione non dovrebbe discostarsi.\nNessuno di noi \u00e8 un attentatore della concorrenza. Tuttavia, questo valore essenziale nell\u2019economia di mercato \u00e8 stato spesso ideologizzato da burocrati e da economisti privi di responsabilit\u00e0 politica, sino al punto da innescare nell\u2019economia reale colpevoli ritardi nel recupero di competitivit\u00e0 di intere regioni dell\u2019Unione europea.\nCome ha gi\u00e0 detto l\u2019onorevole Pittella, oggi si deve voltar pagina conciliando concorrenza e politiche di coesione. In questa direzione, ad esempio, \u00e8 utile la fiscalit\u00e0 di vantaggio che pu\u00f2 concorrere in maniera determinante alle politiche di coesione e che, in assenza di un\u2019armonizzazione fiscale tra gli Stati membri, costituisce uno strumento indispensabile nelle mani dei governi nazionali per combattere il sottosviluppo regionale.\nDesidero dunque rivolgere alla signora Kroes solamente la raccomandazione di redigere al pi\u00f9 presto una nuova proposta di direttiva tenendo presenti, se non esclusivamente almeno prevalentemente, gli orientamenti del Parlamento, visto che la crisi in cui l\u2019Unione si dibatte \u00e8 tutta racchiusa nella crisi del Consiglio e nella sua incapacit\u00e0, ad esempio, di superare le liberalizzazioni asimmetriche dei mercati degli Stati membri, che sono la tomba della concorrenza molto pi\u00f9 di quanto non lo sia qualche aiuto di Stato sbagliato.", "agenda_item": "State aid reform (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060213-ITEM-012", "intervention_id": "1-138", "summary_english": "```json\n{\n  \"headline\": \"State aid reform needed to balance competition with cohesion policy and support regional development\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"The speaker addresses the European Union's approach to state aid reform, criticizing the previous Prodi Commission's treatment of state aid as purely anti-competitive while highlighting the EU's problem of low and uncompetitive growth.
