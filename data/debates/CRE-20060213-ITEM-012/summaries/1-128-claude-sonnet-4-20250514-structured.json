I agree that the administrative aspects of the procedure ought to be simplified, too. I strongly agree that we should increase the transparency of assistance. I also agree that a clearer regulation should be developed, especially in the area of public services. Transparency is also needed to make it clear who may be granted government assistance. Therefore the provision of assistance should be accompanied by the publication of a detailed list of those who are granted assistance, specifying the amounts received by each of them, especially in the case of agricultural allocations.\nHowever, I would like to call attention to the fact that while, on the one hand, I agree that there should not be any discrimination between regions or countries as regards assistance, on the other hand we must acknowledge that there are significantly underdeveloped countries and regions within the internal market. However, these countries \u2013 precisely in the interest of deepening the internal market \u2013 need a longer period of adaptation. It would not be fortunate if the debate on government assistance provided an opportunity for political attacks against the new Member States. These new Member States have already reduced their assistance significantly. These levels of assistance are not outstanding even when compared to their GDP, and they are lower than those of the more developed Member States in the most relevant comparison terms of euro/capita. This must also be taken into consideration when new Member States are accused in other areas, for instance of tax dumping. Also, it would not be fortunate if someone were to make a connection between government and European Union assistance and the delocation of companies, especially when new Member States are still in a negative transition period as regards structural funds or direct payments.\nApart from defined regional assistance, the aim is indeed to assist investments that create jobs in underdeveloped, competitively disadvantaged regions. We are not aiming at introducing an approach that would drive investors away from the European Union. Therefore maintaining well-targeted, but moderate assistance could be both justified and useful, without distorting competition. This is already forecasted in the Directives concerning regional assistance.", "lang": "HU", "original": "Zsolt L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Becsey (PPE-DE). \u2013 Gratul\u00e1lok H\u00f6kmark koll\u00e9g\u00e1mnak a hasznos jelent\u00e9s\u00e9rt, hiszen az ut\u00f3bbi n\u00e9h\u00e1ny \u00e9vben sajnos nem siker\u00fclt cs\u00f6kkenteni a magas t\u00e1mogat\u00e1si szinteket.
