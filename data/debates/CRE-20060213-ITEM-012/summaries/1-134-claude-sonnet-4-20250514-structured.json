I believe that the key strategy is one of reducing the amount of State aid, rewarding some sectors that have been mentioned, such as innovation, research, the environment and businesses, and ensuring greater transparency.\nAs my colleague, Mr\u00a0S\u00e1nchez Presedo, just mentioned, it is also advisable to link State aid to the cohesion policy. In this area, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has rightly added a paragraph on advantageous tax conditions. We are talking here about an instrument that can tie in with the cohesion measures and release entrepreneurial potential in some particularly disadvantaged areas.\nI hope that the Commission and Commissioner Kroes intend to take account of this important statement by Parliament.", "lang": "IT", "original": "Giovanni Pittella (PSE). \u2013 Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, anch\u2019io concordo con il relatore, con la signora Commissario e con molti colleghi sull\u2019opportunit\u00e0 di riformare gli aiuti di Stato adeguandoli alle sfide attuali.\nIl problema \u00e8 trovare le giuste modalit\u00e0. Ritengo che la strada maestra sia quella di ridurre il numero degli aiuti di Stato, di premiare alcuni settori che sono stati evocati, quali l\u2019innovazione, la ricerca, l\u2019ambiente e le imprese, e di assicurare una maggiore trasparenza.\nCome ha ricordato poc\u2019anzi il collega S\u00e1nchez Presedo, \u00e8 anche opportuno raccordare gli aiuti di Stato alla politica di coesione. In tale ambito, la commissione per i problemi economici e monetari ha giustamente inserito un paragrafo relativo alla fiscalit\u00e0 di vantaggio. Si tratta di uno strumento che pu\u00f2 sposarsi con gli interventi per la coesione e liberare potenzialit\u00e0 imprenditoriali in alcune aree particolarmente svantaggiate.\nMi auguro che la Commissione e la signora Commissario vogliano tener conto di questo importante pronunciamento del Parlamento.", "agenda_item": "State aid reform (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060213-ITEM-012", "intervention_id": "1-134", "summary_english": "```json\n{\n  \"headline\": \"Support for State Aid Reform with Focus on Innovation, Environment, and Regional Development\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"The speaker addresses the need for State aid reform to adapt to current challenges, emphasizing the importance of finding the right methods for reform.
