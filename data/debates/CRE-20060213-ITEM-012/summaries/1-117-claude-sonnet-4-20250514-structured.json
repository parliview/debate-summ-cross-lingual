I would like to take this opportunity to raise the issue of regional bonuses. It seems to me that in striving to attain the Lisbon Agenda parameters it would be logical to invest more in regions that are lagging behind, otherwise we risk creating only advanced, competitive enclaves that will inevitably be held back by the depressed areas, thus preventing the all-round growth of the European Union.\nIn addition, I\u00a0would like to emphasise the need to simplify procedures and to make the whole system of State aid provision transparent. Maximum transparency should be applied rigorously to the process of allocating and approving State aid. All persons and entities applying for aid in support of their activities must feel sure, in the event that they are turned down, that it was for objective reasons. Similarly, they must be informed about who has been granted aid, and why. This will generate a spirit of trust, and will enable citizens to have faith that the EU system is functioning in a uniform way.\nNational governments are important elements that can either support or disrupt this system. If they are given more responsibility for taking decisions on State aid provision, their decisions and activities must be subject to the transparency of the entire system. I\u00a0hope, Mr President, that we will all be able to conclude, following the reform of State aid provision, that the system really has been improved, and that it will contribute in a clearly objective manner to the uniform development of the European Union.", "lang": "SK", "original": "Milo\u0161 Koterec (PSE), Spravodajca V\u00fdboru pre region\u00e1lny rozvoj po\u017eiadan\u00e9ho o stanovisko . \u2013 Dovo\u013ete, aby som ako \u010dlen V\u00fdboru pre region\u00e1lny rozvoj a spravodajca pre ned\u00e1vno prijat\u00fa spr\u00e1vu o \u0161t\u00e1tnej pomoci pri region\u00e1lnom rozvoji povedal p\u00e1r slov z poh\u013eadu mo\u017en\u00fdch vplyvov reformy \u0161t\u00e1tnej pomoci na hospod\u00e1rsku, soci\u00e1lnu a teritori\u00e1lnu koh\u00e9ziu.\nAko Komisia vo svojom dokumente spr\u00e1vne kon\u0161tatuje, poskytovanie \u0161t\u00e1tnej pomoci je d\u00f4le\u017eit\u00fdm faktorom zabezpe\u010denia rovnomern\u00e9ho region\u00e1lneho rozvoja, a tak podporou jedn\u00e9ho zo z\u00e1kladn\u00fdch ekonomick\u00fdch pilierov Eur\u00f3pskej \u00fanie.
