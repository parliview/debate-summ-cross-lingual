Aid must not be given where it would work against these principles.\nProperly targeted State aid encourages enterprise and creates jobs, even in regions that suffer from permanent natural disadvantages or are a long way from the big markets. Those regions that suffer from permanent natural disadvantages, such as those in the north, should be in the same category as the Objective 1 zones.\nAid needs to be targeted more precisely, and should especially be allocated to bottlenecks in business, such as risk financing to create new technology and put it to use.
