Let me start by reading through the provided debate summary carefully.\n\nFirst, the debate was about State Aid Reform from 2005-2009. The summary mentions several speakers like Gunnar H\u00f6kmark, Neelie Kroes, Sophia in 't Veld, and others. But the user is asking about the \"President.\" Wait, in the context of a parliamentary debate, the \"President\" might refer to the President of the European Parliament or perhaps the chair of the debate. However, looking through the summary, I don't see any specific contributions attributed to a \"President.\" \n\nLet me check each section again. The Executive Summary lists various speakers with their party affiliations and quotes. For example, Gunnar H\u00f6kmark is mentioned as the rapporteur, and Commissioner Neelie Kroes is noted. Other speakers like Sophia in 't Veld, Gilles Savary, etc., are quoted. However, there's no mention of a \"President\" making a contribution. The only place where \"President\" is mentioned is in the user's query, not in the debate summary itself.\n\nWait, maybe the user is referring to the President of the European Parliament at the time? But the summary doesn't include any statements from the President. The summary does mention Commissioner Kroes, but that's the Commissioner for Competition, not the President. The debate was part of the European Parliament's proceedings, so the President of the Parliament would typically preside over the debate, but their role is usually procedural, not making speeches. \n\nLooking back at the debate summary structure, under \"Executive Summary,\" there's a section on \"Commissioner's Response\" where Kroes speaks, but no mention of the President. The \"Key Proposals and Recommendations\" section lists various proposals but again no mention of the President. The user's query says \"Speaker Name: President,\" but the summary doesn't attribute any statements to the President. \n\nTherefore, based on the provided information, there are no arguments or contributions from the \"President\" in this debate. The user's instruction says that if there are no points attributed to the speaker, I should respond with an empty string. So the answer should be an empty string because the President isn't mentioned as making any contributions in the summary.\n</think>\n\n\"President\" is not mentioned as making any contributions in the debate summary provided.", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Gunnar H\u00f6kmark (PPE-DE),", "english": "Gunnar H\u00f6kmark (PPE-DE), rapporteur . \u2013 Mr President, the roadmap for State aid reform from the Commission is a good and an important document. I hope that this report will contribute to the improvement of the State aid policy. Therefore, I should like to thank colleagues and shadow rapporteurs who have contributed to this improvement by the amendments and discussions we have had in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. I hope there will be, as there was in the committee, broad support for this new policy, which I hope will make an impact on the future guidelines on State aid policy that the Commission will be responsible for.\n(SV) Mr\u00a0President, Europe needs a competitive economy. As we say over and over again, we need new businesses, new jobs, new products and new markets. It is, therefore, also important to follow these matters up by ensuring that new, small companies operate under basic conditions as good as those under which old, large companies operate. Experience of various kinds teaches us that State aid always tends to safeguard old, existing companies at the expense of new and growing companies.\nIf we look around at the European economy, as well as at the international economy, we see very clearly that the new companies and the new products have emerged not through State aid but through the existence of sound basic conditions for businesses and individual entrepreneurs. Each type of State aid that distorts competition always tends to distort it at the expense of what is new and growing and to the advantage of what is old. This is therefore an issue that, to the highest degree, is about how we are to obtain new jobs and new businesses. A policy of State aid whereby we preserve businesses that are not very competitive, together with old products and low wages, will contribute to Europe lagging behind. However, a policy that aims for less State aid and at removing such State aid as distorts competition and that, moreover, invests resources in innovation and research will be able to produce a different outcome.\nIn European history, we have a lot to learn from a whole range of different experiences where State aid is concerned. In my report, I write that the Commission needs carefully to monitor and analyse these experiences, as well as the good experiences there are, because the objective of State aid is often popular and generally approved of. The problem is simply that the results of it are rarely what one had imagined they would be. As a consequence, we end up with old structures and with a dependency on subsidies, and we do not produce new jobs. We have seen this within the shipbuilding and steel industries and within a great many other sectors. Where State aid is introduced, renewal and transformation go out of the window. We must ensure that the opposite situation comes about.\nAn overarching objective of the report is to follow up the general aim not only of reducing State aid but also, as stated clearly in the report and still more clearly in the Commission\u2019s document, of removing such State aid as distorts competition. A further objective is to ensure that those rules that exist are made clearer, for the aim must be to follow up the demand for less State aid. What is required is that State aid be predictable. It must not be possible for it to be used for relocations. The rules governing State aid must be generally applicable. The aid must not have a specific focus, but be directed across the board and not favour one company at the expense of another. That is extremely important when we debate innovation, for innovation policy must not be an excuse for increased State aid but be designed to create better basic conditions for innovation. The same applies to companies in the public interest. We must not have State aid that funds that type of activity excessively, but must give new companies opportunities to develop.\nThe same may be said of regional or environmental aid. It must be directed across the board and so made open and accessible to all. If we ensure that this happens and follow up the demands for increased scrutiny and transparency, better rendering of accounts and more stringent auditing, we shall lay the basis for a State aid policy that entails less State aid, and such State aid as there is will no longer distort competition.

That's a key point. \n\nI should check if there are any other mentions of his contributions. The summary also states that Commissioner Neelie Kroes endorsed his approach, but that's her endorsement, not his own arguments. The core reform philosophy section specifically attributes the argument about safeguarding old companies and the need for less and better-targeted aid to H\u00f6kmark. \n\nLooking through the rest of the summary, other speakers have their own points, but the user wants only the arguments attributed to Gunnar H\u00f6kmark.

I am very pleased that Parliament, like the great majority of stakeholders, is supportive, in general, of the Commission\u2019s plans.\nI will not repeat the content of the reform programme, which was touched upon by the rapporteur. In the spirit of the Lisbon Strategy, we want State aid reform to help Member States get the best value for money by focusing state resources on measures that will contribute to sustainable economic growth and to more and better jobs for the future. State aid is taxpayers\u2019 money, so we need to take into account that we can explain it to those who want it and those who obtain it. We also want to improve the procedures and administration of State aid policy, as was rightly touched upon by the rapporteur.\nOne important message in the report is the need for legal certainty. I fully share the concern that, if we are not successful in making that legal certainty visible, then we will have failed. The Commission will explain further how it intends to use economics for State aid policy. Market failure is not a magic word; it is, rather, a methodology to analyse the problems within markets. I agree with the report\u2019s focus on the need for transparency of aid. On services of general economic interest, the Commission has no competence to interpret the jurisprudence. Nevertheless \u2013 I got your message, Mr President! \u2013 the Commission will try to give guidance when adopting decisions on individual cases in this field.\nI look forward to your questions and comments, and I will do my utmost to respond to them.", "reconstructed_position": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a detailed summary of a parliamentary debate about state aid reform and wants me to outline the main points made by Neelie Kroes. \n\nFirst, I need to go through the debate summary carefully. The user mentioned that contributions from other speakers shouldn't be included, only those from the specified speaker, which in this case is Neelie Kroes. \n\nLooking at the summary, there's a section titled \"Commissioner Neelie Kroes\" where her statements are mentioned. The key points here are that she endorsed the approach of \"less and better-targeted State aid,\" emphasizing that state aid is taxpayers' money and needs to be explained to those who receive it. She also warned against a subsidy race between member states. \n\nI need to make sure I don't include anything from other speakers like Gunnar H\u00f6kmark or others. The user specified that if there are no points attributed to the speaker, I should return an empty string. But in this case, there are indeed points from Kroes. \n\nI should structure the response to list her main arguments clearly. The user wants the main points or arguments made by her, so I'll extract those directly from the summary. Let me check again to ensure I didn't miss any other mentions of her. The summary also mentions her response at the end, where she acknowledges the consensus and mentions improving implementation, transparency, and considering threshold adjustments. However, the user's query is about the debate itself, so maybe the response part is part of the debate contributions. \n\nWait, the user's instruction says to outline the main points or arguments made by the speaker during the debate. The summary includes her statements during the debate and her response. So I should include both. \n\nSo the main points are:\n1. Endorsed the principle of \"less and better-targeted State aid.\"\n2. Emphasized that State aid is taxpayers' money and needs to be explained to recipients.\n3. Warned against a subsidy race among Member States.\n4. Acknowledged broad consensus and commitment to improving implementation, transparency, and considering threshold adjustments.\n\nI need to present these concisely, without any extra information. Also, check if there's any other input from her. The summary also mentions she said \"history has shown that by doing that you do not make the poor rich, you simply make the rich poor\" but wait, no, that's Graham Booth's statement. So no, Kroes' points are as listed. \n\nSo the final answer should list those points clearly.\n</think>\n\nCommissioner Neelie Kroes emphasized the need for \"less and better-targeted State aid,\" framing it as \"taxpayers' money\" requiring accountability and transparency. She warned against a \"subsidy race between the Member States\" and endorsed the rapporteur's approach, highlighting the importance of explaining aid to both providers and recipients. Kroes acknowledged broad political consensus on the reforms, committing to improve implementation, transparency, and consider threshold adjustments while prioritizing SMEs, which constitute 92% of EU enterprises.", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Milo\u0161 Koterec (PSE),", "english": "Milo\u0161 Koterec (PSE), rapporteur of the Committee on Regional Development, asked for an opinion . \u2013 (SK) As a\u00a0member of the Committee on Regional Development and rapporteur for the recently adopted report on State aid for regional development, allow me to make a\u00a0few points concerning the possible implications of the reform of State aid for economic, social and territorial cohesion.\nIn its document, the Commission correctly indicates that State aid is an important factor in ensuring homogenous regional development, thereby strengthening one of the fundamental economic pillars of the European Union. I would like to take this opportunity to raise the issue of regional bonuses. It seems to me that in striving to attain the Lisbon Agenda parameters it would be logical to invest more in regions that are lagging behind, otherwise we risk creating only advanced, competitive enclaves that will inevitably be held back by the depressed areas, thus preventing the all-round growth of the European Union.\nIn addition, I\u00a0would like to emphasise the need to simplify procedures and to make the whole system of State aid provision transparent. Maximum transparency should be applied rigorously to the process of allocating and approving State aid. All persons and entities applying for aid in support of their activities must feel sure, in the event that they are turned down, that it was for objective reasons. Similarly, they must be informed about who has been granted aid, and why. This will generate a spirit of trust, and will enable citizens to have faith that the EU system is functioning in a uniform way.\nNational governments are important elements that can either support or disrupt this system.

Let me start by looking through the provided debate summary.\n\nFirst, the user mentioned that the task is to outline the main points or arguments made by the specified speaker, in this case, Milo\u0161 Koterec. The key here is to only include what's attributed to him and not other speakers. \n\nLooking at the summary, there's a section titled \"Regional Development and Cohesion Concerns\" which mentions Milo\u0161 Koterec (PSE). The exact quote is: \"Milo\u0161 Koterec (PSE) stressed the importance of investing 'more in regions that are lagging behind, otherwise we risk creating only advanced, competitive enclaves that will inevitably be held back by the depressed areas' [Koterec, 2006-02-13].\"\n\nSo, the main argument here is about regional development. Koterec is emphasizing the need to invest in lagging regions to prevent the creation of competitive enclaves that are held back by less developed areas. That seems to be the core point. \n\nI should check if there are any other mentions of Koterec in the summary. Scanning through the other sections: the \"Key Proposals and Recommendations\" part lists some proposals, but I don't see Koterec's name there. The other sections like \"Opposition Voices\" or \"Procedural and Transparency Improvements\" mention other speakers like Manolakou, Booth, Wortmann-Kool, and Casa, but not Koterec. \n\nSo, the only direct contribution from Koterec is the one about regional investment. Therefore, the main point is his argument regarding investing in lagging regions to avoid economic disparities. There's no other information provided about his arguments. \n\nI need to make sure not to include any other speakers' points.

If one thing explains the differences in growth between the United States and Europe, it is dynamism, the power of its small and medium-sized companies, not so much in terms of net birth rate, which is more or less the same, but in terms of US small businesses\u2019 greater capacity for growth in the first two years, which requires a degree of funding. And in the field of risk capital we are a long way behind. If my figures are accurate, while risk capital represents 0.45% of United States GDP, European risk capital is less than 0.14%.\nOn the issue of regional aid \u2013 my final point \u2013 I would also stress what Mr Koterec has said, but I would like to add an aspect that has not been mentioned: it would not make sense also to take State aid away from regions that stop receiving Structural Funds as a result of natural growth, and not just for statistical reasons, as the rapporteur has said. If the Commissioner will allow me, therefore, I would like to correct paragraph 36 on this issue, to include regions losing funds for statistical reasons and those that lose them through natural growth.\nI congratulate the rapporteur once again.", "reconstructed_position": "<think>\nOkay, let's see.

The summary has sections like Core Reform Philosophy, Competing Perspectives, Regional Development, etc. Let me scan each part.\n\nLooking at the \"Innovation and Environmental Priorities\" section, there's a mention of Jos\u00e9 Manuel Garc\u00eda-Margallo y Marfil. The key point here is that he highlighted Europe's lag in risk capital compared to the US. He noted that risk capital in the US is 0.45% of GDP, while Europe's is less than 0.14%. That's a specific argument about the need to boost risk capital.\n\nI need to make sure there are no other mentions of him elsewhere. Scanning through the other sections: Core Reform Philosophy mentions H\u00f6kmark and Kroes, then in Competing Perspectives, in 't Veld, Savary, van den Burg. Regional Development has Koterec, Becsey. Then Innovation and Environmental has Garc\u00eda-Margallo and Schroedter. The rest of the sections like Opposition Voices, Procedural Improvements, Key Proposals, Commissioner's Response don't mention him again.\n\nSo the only point attributed to Garc\u00eda-Margallo y Marfil is the one about risk capital. The user's instruction says to only include points from the specified speaker.

We are in fact dealing here with a non-legislative report, and I believe that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has done a good job in terms of voicing the European Parliament\u2019s strong position. On the whole, we have managed to end up with a fairly clear outlook on things.\nI am one of those who believe, along with the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, that we do in fact need to review the State aid system. This system is more than ever at the heart of the Commission\u2019s powers, since Europe remains essentially a Europe of the internal market and competition until further notice. I am not sure whether the \u2018No\u2019 vote in the French referendum offers other prospects for the long-term future. We are therefore truly at the heart of Community powers here, and it is true that, with the enlargement of Europe, the European Union and the Commission are at risk of thrombosis if the State aid system and arrangements are left in their current state.\nParliament has above all stressed that the internal market and competition should not be regarded as representing every aspect of European society. We are not just a market society; there must, as the texts stipulate, also be room for public action, not only on all those occasions when the market is failing, but also on all those occasions when we need to reduce social or territorial inequalities, manage external effects, promote innovation and, should the need arise, give a boost to industry. When, at times, we shift to a free market way of thinking, we sometimes find ourselves wondering: \u2018Would we be in a position today to build the Airbus or would we be in a position to build the Ariane rocket, given the dominant ideology?\u2019 I believe that we must retain this opportunity to intervene very forcefully in the industrial landscape and in public research.\nI should like to say to the Commissioner that the main contribution of Parliament is to ensure that State aid is not assessed as something merely to be borne but, rather, is assessed in a balanced way, that is to say that not only are the negative aspects, such as distortions of competition, considered, but so too are the positive effects. We, in the European Parliament, wanted the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality to be clearly applied and, more specifically, wanted State aid that has no obvious impact on the internal market to be considered as compensation. We also wanted market failures to be better understood.\nFinally, I should like to mention the issues that still need to be discussed and that are referred to in the 21 amendments tabled. With regard to public services, we need clarification on those aspects to do with compensation, with the legitimate funding of public services and with subsidiary funding and, above all, we need clarification on what constitutes the fourth criterion set out in the Altmark judgment, a criterion that, by the Commission\u2019s own admission, is actually extremely vague and very difficult to handle.\nWith regard to innovation, Mrs\u00a0in 't Veld will soon present us with her report. We believe that it is a very good text and we hope to enhance it. The question that must be asked concerns the scope of the report: should it be strictly confined to innovation, or should it branch out a little further into the area of research and development? With regard to the regions, some excellent amendments are focused on preventing relocations from being funded by State aid. This is an extremely serious problem because it gives Europeans the impression that they are being pitted against one another, and this in terms, furthermore, of the amount received by way of public subsidies.\nFinally, I should like to conclude by saying that we are obviously totally in favour of State aid being considered in the framework of the Lisbon Process and the Gothenburg Process, that is to say not only in terms of the knowledge-based economy, but also in terms of helping the environment.", "lang": "FR", "original": "Gilles Savary, au nom du groupe PSE . - Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, je voudrais remercier notre rapporteur M.

The task is to outline the main points or arguments made by a specific speaker, in this case, Gilles Savary. The instructions say to only include the points attributed to him and ignore others. If there are none, I should return an empty string.\n\nLooking at the summary, under the section \"Competing Perspectives on State Aid Philosophy,\" there's a mention of Gilles Savary (PSE). The summary states: \"Savary emphasized that 'we are not just a market society; there must also be room for public action' and questioned whether Europe could still 'build the Airbus or build the Ariane rocket, given the dominant ideology' [Savary, 2006-02-13].\"\n\nSo, the key points from Savary are:\n1. Arguing that Europe isn't just a market society and needs room for public action.\n2. Questioning the ability to undertake major projects like Airbus or Ariane rocket under the dominant ideology (which seems to be the market-oriented approach).\n\nI need to present these points clearly.

State support should be a last resort and is not a panacea. Although it may be presented in that way from time to time, it also has adverse side effects.\nAt the same time, we can be open-handed in granting state support only after all pre-conditions and our other items of policy have been complied with, or else we would end up fighting a running battle. We must, for example, ensure that the internal market is completed and functions well and in that respect, I hope that this House will be taking a sensible decision on Thursday with regard to the services directive.\nWe must counter protectionism, promote fair competition, abolish red tape and excessive legislation, guarantee better access to risk capital and also establish an internal market for financial services, but at the same time, we must put in place such things as truly free movement for workers from all EU Member States and an immigration policy that is geared towards keeping the brightest and best, our top people, in Europe rather than chasing them away to the United States.\nOnly when those things are in place can we see whether we might be able to intervene with State aid where the market is inefficient, for we are not so much dealing with market failure as we are with market inefficiencies.\nI should also like to repeat that State aid should, in principle, not be sanctioned. It disrupts the market and distorts competition. Mr Savary said a moment ago that the EU has a tendency to be too liberal, but I should like to draw Mr Savary\u2019s attention to the fact that we spend billions on State aid each year. Even by the most conservative estimates, the amounts involved are more or less half of the EU\u2019s budget, so that is not terribly liberal in my view. Things could be a bit more liberal as far as I am concerned.\nI also agree with what Mr Savary said a moment ago: we must set aside State aid for the priorities of the twenty-first century: the Lisbon objectives, innovation, knowledge, sustainability \u2026\nConsequently, I think that we should give far less State aid to obsolete and obsolescent industries, and as far as State aid for environmental objectives is concerned, I think we should first set to abolishing the billions of State aid we grant the many polluting industries and sectors that make use of sources of non-renewable energy, and I will therefore advise my group to support Mr Lipietz\u2019s amendments to that effect.\nGlobal context is also important in the debate. We cannot deny, of course, that in other parts of the world, liberal amounts of State aid are still being given out. That much we should recognise, but our objective to reduce State aid remains intact.\nFinally, I should like to say a few words on public services. I should like to repeat \u2013 and I am increasingly feeling like a voice in the wilderness in this respect \u2013 that the phrases \u2018services of general interest\u2019 and \u2018services of general economic interest\u2019 have still not been defined, and it is, in that light, very odd to legislate for them. That is just by the by.\nAs Mr Savary mentioned a moment ago, legal certainty and clarity are urgently needed for those public services.\nI should like to finish by asking the Commission to submit, at the earliest opportunity, an assessment of the impact which the rules that the Commission adopted last year had on State aid as compensation for public services.

Staatssteun moet een laatste redmiddel zijn en het is geen wondermiddel. Het wordt wel eens een keer zo gepresenteerd, maar staatssteun heeft ook negatieve bijwerkingen.\nDaarnaast kunnen we niet ruimhartig staatssteun geven, als alle randvoorwaarden en ons ander beleid niet in orde zijn. Dat is namelijk dweilen met de kraan open. We moeten er bijvoorbeeld voor zorgen dat de interne markt vervolmaakt wordt en goed functioneert en wat dat betreft, hoop ik dus ook dat dit Parlement op donderdag een verstandige keuze ten aanzien van de dienstenrichtlijn zal maken.\nWe moeten protectionisme tegengaan, we moeten eerlijke concurrentie stimuleren, bureaucratie en overregulering afschaffen, zorgen voor betere toegang tot risicokapitaal en ook een interne markt tot stand brengen voor financi\u00eble diensten, maar tegelijk moeten we zorgen voor zaken als bijvoorbeeld een echt vrij verkeer voor werknemers uit alle EU-lidstaten en een immigratiebeleid dat erop gericht is om de \u201cbest en brightest\u201d, onze beste krachten, binnen te halen in Europa in plaats van ze weg te jagen naar de Verenigde Staten.\nPas als we al die dingen op orde hebben, kunnen we gaan kijken of we eventueel, waar de markt ineffici\u00ebnt is, want het gaat niet om marktfalen, maar om marktineffici\u00ebnties, kunnen bijspringen met staatssteun.\nStaatssteun mag in principe niet, laten we dat ook nog eens een keer herhalen. Staatssteun verstoort de markt en vervalst concurrentie. De heer Savary zei net dat de EU er wel eens naar neigt te liberaal te zijn, maar ik wil onder de aandacht van de heer Savary brengen dat we elk jaar miljarden aan staatssteun spenderen. Zelfs in de meest conservatieve schattingen gaat het om bedragen ter hoogte van ongeveer de helft van het budget van de Europese Unie, dus dat vind ik niet zo heel erg liberaal. Wat mij betreft mag het wel iets liberaler.\nIk ben het eens met wat de heer Savary ook net gezegd heeft: we moeten staatssteun geven voor de prioriteiten van de 21ste eeuw: de doelstellingen van Lissabon, innovatie, kennis, duurzaamheid ...\nBijgevolg moeten we volgens mij veel minder staatssteun geven aan oude en ten dode opgeschreven industrie\u00ebn en wat staatssteun voor milieudoelstellingen betreft, denk ik dat we eerst eens moeten gaan kijken naar het afschaffen van de miljarden staatssteun die we geven aan hele vervuilende industrie\u00ebn en sectoren die gebruik maken van niet hernieuwbare energiebronnen en ik zal dan ook mijn fractie aanraden om de amendementen te steunen van de heer Lipietz die in die richting gaan.\nVerder is in het debat ook de mondiale context van belang. Natuurlijk is het zo dat we niet kunnen ontkennen dat in andere delen van de wereld nog steeds ruimhartig staatssteun gegeven wordt, dat moeten we erkennen, maar onze doelstelling moet terugdringing van de staatssteun blijven.\nDan tenslotte even over publieke diensten. Ik wil hier nog maar eens zeggen, zo langzamerhand voel ik me een roepende in de woestijn, dat de termen diensten van algemeen belang en diensten van algemeen economisch belang nog steeds niet gedefinieerd zijn en dat het dus heel raar is om daar wetgeving over te maken. Maar goed.\nVoor die publieke diensten is dringend juridische zekerheid en helderheid nodig. Het is net ook al door de heer Savary aangegeven.\nIk zou willen afsluiten, mijnheer de Voorzitter, met een verzoek aan de Commissie, nl. om zo snel mogelijk een evaluatie voor te leggen van de impact van de regels die de Commissie vorig jaar heeft aangenomen met betrekking tot staatssteun als compensatie voor publieke diensten.

State support should be a last resort and is not a panacea. Although it may be presented in that way from time to time, it also has adverse side effects.\nAt the same time, we can be open-handed in granting state support only after all pre-conditions and our other items of policy have been complied with, or else we would end up fighting a running battle. We must, for example, ensure that the internal market is completed and functions well and in that respect, I hope that this House will be taking a sensible decision on Thursday with regard to the services directive.\nWe must counter protectionism, promote fair competition, abolish red tape and excessive legislation, guarantee better access to risk capital and also establish an internal market for financial services, but at the same time, we must put in place such things as truly free movement for workers from all EU Member States and an immigration policy that is geared towards keeping the brightest and best, our top people, in Europe rather than chasing them away to the United States.\nOnly when those things are in place can we see whether we might be able to intervene with State aid where the market is inefficient, for we are not so much dealing with market failure as we are with market inefficiencies.\nI should also like to repeat that State aid should, in principle, not be sanctioned. It disrupts the market and distorts competition. Mr Savary said a moment ago that the EU has a tendency to be too liberal, but I should like to draw Mr Savary\u2019s attention to the fact that we spend billions on State aid each year. Even by the most conservative estimates, the amounts involved are more or less half of the EU\u2019s budget, so that is not terribly liberal in my view. Things could be a bit more liberal as far as I am concerned.\nI also agree with what Mr Savary said a moment ago: we must set aside State aid for the priorities of the twenty-first century: the Lisbon objectives, innovation, knowledge, sustainability \u2026\nConsequently, I think that we should give far less State aid to obsolete and obsolescent industries, and as far as State aid for environmental objectives is concerned, I think we should first set to abolishing the billions of State aid we grant the many polluting industries and sectors that make use of sources of non-renewable energy, and I will therefore advise my group to support Mr Lipietz\u2019s amendments to that effect.\nGlobal context is also important in the debate. We cannot deny, of course, that in other parts of the world, liberal amounts of State aid are still being given out. That much we should recognise, but our objective to reduce State aid remains intact.\nFinally, I should like to say a few words on public services. I should like to repeat \u2013 and I am increasingly feeling like a voice in the wilderness in this respect \u2013 that the phrases \u2018services of general interest\u2019 and \u2018services of general economic interest\u2019 have still not been defined, and it is, in that light, very odd to legislate for them. That is just by the by.\nAs Mr Savary mentioned a moment ago, legal certainty and clarity are urgently needed for those public services.\nI should like to finish by asking the Commission to submit, at the earliest opportunity, an assessment of the impact which the rules that the Commission adopted last year had on State aid as compensation for public services.

This means less State aid for grass-roots needs and servicing of the competitiveness of European capital. In other words, the people's money will be not for grass-roots prosperity, but for the profitability of capital.\nThe references to State aid for purposes of general interest and in the public good at European Union level not only demonstrate indifference to the asymmetrical development between the Member States, but also prejudge that such a procedure will further strengthen this asymmetrical development by increasing inequality and injustice.\nIt is vital, they say, to reduce State aid, in order for it to have positive results. Do remote rural and island areas, such as those in my country, in which capital does not invest because there is no or little profit, really have to be abandoned completely, including by State aid, and be laid to waste? They are already being abandoned, to a degree, and it looks like this will intensify in future.\nPublic services are being privatised, basic grass-roots needs are being commercialised. The reduction in State aid and its orientation towards servicing the anti-grass roots Lisbon Strategy will exacerbate still further the situation of the grass-roots classes. Despite the reference to the financing of small- and medium-sized enterprises for investments, unfortunately the evidence shows that, so far, economic aid for small businesses has been non-existent or has been dispensed with a dropper. By contrast, for big business there has been open-handedness and it is big business that benefits and, with today's proposals, will be strengthened even more.", "reconstructed_position": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the main points or arguments made by Diamanto Manolakou in the State Aid Reform Debate based on the provided summary.

The summary has a section titled \"Opposition Voices\" which includes her. Let me check that part again.\n\nUnder \"Opposition Voices,\" it says: \"Diamanto Manolakou (GUE/NGL) provided the strongest opposition, characterizing the reforms as redirecting 'workers' money' away from 'grass-roots prosperity' toward 'the profitability of capital' and warning about the abandonment of 'remote rural and island areas' [Manolakou, 2006-02-13].\"\n\nSo her main arguments are two-fold.

The Commissioner\u2019s contribution also gave great cause for hope.\nThe reform of policy on State aid is enormously important to people at the local level, where the towns, boroughs and regions are the main sources of public investments. As has already been said, their municipal enterprises play an important part in guaranteeing the provision of services of general interest, and so it is important that the Commission should \u2013 as it has already agreed to do \u2013 announce how it proposes to implement the criteria set out in the ECJ\u2019s ruling in the Altmark case. If legal disputes are to be avoided, those who will have to apply these criteria must have a clear idea of what the Commission\u2019s policy is. The more concrete the Altmark criteria are, the more difficult they are to implement, and the individual public offices cannot be expected to get to grips with the fundamental principle and determine for themselves whether or not aid has been granted on the basis of the avoidance of overcompensation using market compensations; to do so would involve them in a quite unjustifiable amount of bureaucracy.

Die Anwender m\u00fcssen Klarheit \u00fcber die Politik der Kommission haben, um Rechtsstreite zu vermeiden. Die Kriterien des Altmark-Urteils sind umso schwieriger anzuwenden, je konkreter sie sind.

In my view, this \u2018less is more\u2019 mind-set is not the most important dimension. What matters is for what purpose and how this State aid is deployed.

Ik denk dat het ook weer een compliment is voor de Commissie economische en monetaire zaken dat we erin slagen met een zeer liberale Zweedse invalshoek en tegelijk een socialistische Franse invalshoek toch tot goede resultaten te komen.\nIn tegenstelling tot mijn Nederlandse collega mevrouw in \u2019t Veld zou ik niet de nadruk willen leggen op minder staatssteun. Ik denk dat dit minder-meer niet de belangrijkste dimensie is. Het gaat erom met welk doel en hoe die staatssteun wordt ingezet. Staatssteun moet niet alleen gezien worden als een afwijking, een aberratie ten opzichte van perfecte marktwerking, maar als een instrument voor sociale, economische en maatschappelijke doelen.\nHet is positief dat deze Commissaris van mededinging haar portefeuille ook in zo\u2019n bredere economische context ziet, nl. de Lissabon-strategie, en in die Lissabon-strategie gaat het inderdaad niet alleen over economische, maar ook over bredere sociaal-economische effecten. Dus vanuit mijn fractie zou ik met name ook dat willen benadrukken, die sociaal economische context en die bijkomende invalshoek van werkgelegenheid en sociale cohesie.\nIn dit verband zou ik twee punten willen noemen en willen vragen om op die punten geen te dogmatische benadering te kiezen.\nIn de eerste plaats het marktfalen. Daar gaat het er ook om naar bredere aspecten te kijken en volop rekening met werkgelegenheid en sociale cohesie te houden. Het andere punt is het tijdelijke karakter van de staatssteun. Ook daar zou ik ervoor willen pleiten er niet te dogmatisch mee om te gaan, want het kan zijn dat het in sommige sectoren wel degelijk nodig is om ook voor wat langere termijn met overheidssubsidies en overheidsinstrumenten te werken. Ik noem bijvoorbeeld de publieke omroep: het belang van pluraliteit van de pers en een goed evenwicht in de informatievoorziening kan vereisen dat er ook op langere termijn overheidsgeld in zo\u2019n sector gestoken wordt.\nVolkshuisvesting is een ander voorbeeld. Daar kan het ook zijn dat de belangen van stedenbouwkundige planning, het integreren van minderheden en sociale integratie in een stad vereisen dat je bepaalde spelers op de markt voorziet van overheidssteun om die ruimere doelstellingen te kunnen halen.\nDe laatste opmerking gaat over de Europese dimensie en de nationale dimensie. Daar zou ik erop willen wijzen, en dat heeft de heer H\u00f6kmark in het verslag ook gedaan, op het feit dat staatssteun nog wel eens gebruikt wordt om beleidsconcurrentie tussen lidstaten te voeren en ik zou de Commissie willen vragen daarop te letten, daar vanuit de Commissie sterker op toe te zien en ook op het gebied van sanctionering te kijken of de lidstaten zelf op dit punt niet aangepakt moeten worden en niet alleen de bedrijven waar de steun naartoe gaat.", "agenda_item": "State aid reform (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060213-ITEM-012", "intervention_id": "1-126", "summary_english": "{\n  \"headline\": \"Supports Flexible Approach to State Aid Reform with Focus on Socio-Economic Objectives Beyond Market Efficiency\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"The speaker addresses state aid reform, emphasizing the need to view state aid as an instrument for achieving socio-economic objectives rather than merely a market deviation.

The summary says she argued that \"State aid should not only be seen as a deviation or aberration from perfect market forces, but as an instrument for achieving socio-economic objectives.\" \n\nSo her main point here is that state aid isn't just a bad thing that distorts the market; it's a tool to achieve social and economic goals. That's one key argument. I need to make sure there's no other mention of her in other sections.

If we take Gothenburg seriously, it makes sound business sense to rely on the equilateral triangle between economic, social and environmental development, but the statement is flawed in economic terms.\nIf Mr H\u00f6kmark \u2013 as he himself is right to say \u2013 wants small and medium-sized enterprises to be efficient and innovation to be driven forward, above all by subsidy, then what is needed alongside that is good training, good education, and the right infrastructure \u2013 not just in the great conurbations, but also, of course, in rural areas. He is therefore forced back onto the need for territorial, social and environmental cohesion.\nIf not, the simple fact is that people who live in places without these favourable and natural conditions are put at a disadvantage. That being so, I do indeed urge that a great deal of care be taken when considering where aid is to be applied, and it also has to be considered whether services in the public interest benefit from it, or else there is no point to it.\nIn one respect, I can tell Mr H\u00f6kmark that he is absolutely right. He writes that it makes no sense to give aid to businesses that are already profitable, and in that I agree with him.\nWhen I say that that sort of aid is wrong, I am thinking of the Federal Republic of Germany and of the highly-profitable motor industry into which money is shovelled, only for the firms to then close down and take production elsewhere with the help of more subsidies. That cannot be what aid is for. In that respect, Mr\u00a0H\u00f6kmark, you have got it absolutely right.\nThere are a whole load of models that we have to change. The de minimis threshold is the right one.

If we take Gothenburg seriously, it makes sound business sense to rely on the equilateral triangle between economic, social and environmental development, but the statement is flawed in economic terms.\nIf Mr H\u00f6kmark \u2013 as he himself is right to say \u2013 wants small and medium-sized enterprises to be efficient and innovation to be driven forward, above all by subsidy, then what is needed alongside that is good training, good education, and the right infrastructure \u2013 not just in the great conurbations, but also, of course, in rural areas. He is therefore forced back onto the need for territorial, social and environmental cohesion.\nIf not, the simple fact is that people who live in places without these favourable and natural conditions are put at a disadvantage. That being so, I do indeed urge that a great deal of care be taken when considering where aid is to be applied, and it also has to be considered whether services in the public interest benefit from it, or else there is no point to it.\nIn one respect, I can tell Mr H\u00f6kmark that he is absolutely right. He writes that it makes no sense to give aid to businesses that are already profitable, and in that I agree with him.\nWhen I say that that sort of aid is wrong, I am thinking of the Federal Republic of Germany and of the highly-profitable motor industry into which money is shovelled, only for the firms to then close down and take production elsewhere with the help of more subsidies. That cannot be what aid is for. In that respect, Mr\u00a0H\u00f6kmark, you have got it absolutely right.\nThere are a whole load of models that we have to change. The de minimis threshold is the right one. It is indeed the case that regional aid is needed for the more backward regions in particular, and it cannot be denied that aid under Article 87 will continue to be needed for those regions currently affected by the statistical effect.", "reconstructed_position": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what Helmuth Markov from GUE/NGL said in the debate.

On the one hand, it is naturally in our interest to make sure that State aid provided in individual Member States does not undermine the natural competitive environment. On the other hand, it gives me great pleasure that in its action plan for State aid reform the Commission has taken into consideration the fact that it is essential to strengthen the European Union by means of promoting the knowledge-based economy, something we have been demanding for so long.\nIn my contribution, I\u00a0would particularly like to emphasise innovation, research and development, areas closely associated with access to venture capital. These are areas where public funding may be usefully applied, generating high rates of return in the form of sustainable development and the increased competitiveness of the European economy, primarily for small and medium-sized enterprises.\nThe model of public and private partnerships establishing research and development centres, technology incubators and high-tech centres where universities have an important role, as well as local and regional authorities and third sector institutions, may contribute significantly to greater transparency over the use of public funds and, at the same time, help better tap the research, technological and innovation potential of individual member countries. The same applies to venture capital funds. Without public funds, it is almost impossible to set up the seed capital funds that innovative start-up businesses need so badly. State aid policy must in no way restrain their development. On the contrary, it should encourage and attract sufficient private capital funding.

Die Unterst\u00fctzung von Unternehmen durch staatliche Beihilfen ist einer der Faktoren, der die Entscheidung von Unternehmen zur Investition in einem bestimmten Gebiet beeinflusst und somit wesentlich zum Wirtschaftswachstum und zur Schaffung von Arbeitspl\u00e4tzen in diesem Gebiet beitr\u00e4gt. Grunds\u00e4tzlich sind nach dem EG-Vertrag staatliche Beihilfen nicht erlaubt, sofern sie sich nachteilig auf den Binnenmarkt auswirken, da sie zur Verz\u00f6gerung des Wettbewerbs f\u00fchren k\u00f6nnen. Bestimmte staatliche Beihilfen f\u00fcr spezielle Zwecke sind jedoch von diesem Grundsatz ausgenommen, etwa solche zur F\u00f6rderung der wirtschaftlichen Entwicklung benachteiligter Regionen in Europa. Als Mitglied des Ausschusses f\u00fcr regionale Entwicklung bin ich der festen \u00dcberzeugung, dass die staatlichen Direktbeihilfen in ihrer Schl\u00fcsselfunktion als Instrument der regionalen Entwicklung ein wichtiges Mittel zur Erreichung vorrangiger Koh\u00e4sionsziele sind.\nDie beihilferechtlichen Spielr\u00e4ume, wie sie sich aus Artikel 87 Absatz 3 Buchstabe\u00a0a EG-Vertrag in Verbindung mit den Leitlinien f\u00fcr die Regionalbeihilfen ergeben, haben es den betroffenen Regionen in der Vergangenheit erm\u00f6glicht, den Aufholprozess durch die Ansiedlung von Unternehmen aktiv zu gestalten.

Mr President, I count my blessings tonight. I conclude that there is not that much difference between political views on this issue. I congratulate the rapporteur. The content of the report and the Commission review are in line with what we discussed during this debate.\nI should like to underline that there is no rigid dogma. That was made clear on your side. It is more that we try to give a hook to Member States\u2019 companies, because the aid does not go to the Member States themselves. Via State aid, the Member State gives a hook to those who need a bit of help, instead of just giving them the fish. They want to do it themselves, but they need a little bit of backing.\nMrs in\u2018t Veld and other Members have talked about less and better State aid. She mentioned that that statement by the Commission is appropriate advice, in the opinion of her political group and her personal opinion. I would have been pleased to say that it was my wording, but we got it from the Council. Aid should be less and better. That is what we tried to indicate and that is what the rapporteur put in his report. State aid reform has to be shaped to deliver not only on growth, innovation and employment, but also on a wide range of primarily non-economic issues. We all agree that they are of fundamental importance to our social European model. These include the social and regional cohesion, human capital and cultural diversity rightly mentioned by Mrs van den Burg. However, State aid should be used wisely, because it is taxpayers\u2019 money. We should not compete through State aid by the Member States, because that is the wrong route. It would have a very detrimental effect. We must not allow a subsidy race between the Member States, so there is clearly a need for less aid, and aid that is better targeted.\nOn the specific concerns raised here today, the Commission will do its utmost to improve how the rules work in practice. It will also step up transparency, rightly called for by a number of Members. Aid should be monitored, but in the end it is only through a positive partnership that we will be able to deliver successful State aid reform.\nA couple of Members touched upon the role of the regional aid guidelines and focusing aid on the regions most in need. We discussed this before and it was adopted last year. Again that is not dogmatic, but it takes account of the fact that some need more backing at a particular moment. We want to deliver a fair and balanced package and we discussed that here in December.\nWe will look further at how the State aid rules can be adapted to new financing mechanisms such as public-private partnerships. The same goes for aid for projects of common interest to boost competitiveness and technological innovation. The question of innovation has been raised. I have just read an article by Professor Getz, saying that innovation should not just be developed in the research and development department of a company, it should be at all levels, from bottom to top. That is an interesting philosophy that could be considered when we are talking about how to boost innovation.\nTurning to SMEs, when we look at the 25 Member States, 92% of all the enterprises in the European Union are in the category of small and medium-sized enterprises. So when we talk about creating jobs and economic growth, we have to bear in mind that the vast majority fall within the category of small and medium-sized enterprises. That is what we are trying to take into account when we talk about giving them more attention than they have received up to now and to stimulate innovation and cooperation between, sometimes, a combination of research institutes, smaller companies and larger companies. It is a challenge to ensure that all those SMEs can take advantage of these opportunities.\nIt has rightly been mentioned that risk capital is not very developed in Europe. Compared to the United States, quite often innovative ideas are not taken up by companies that are small or just starting up because there is no backing from the banks. State aid to back those companies in their early development could be very helpful.\nMr Wortmann-Kool asked whether the Commission could raise the threshold. I am not saying that we would not be prepared to raise it. However, we should bear in mind that we are talking about SMEs and not large companies, and we should try to reduce bureaucracy and red tape. The amount of euros we are talking about really covers that category.

I am talking about less bureaucracy. I am being consistent and not saying that we should still do it when it is not necessary.\nFinally, the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs have done a great deal of work on this report and I am grateful that we can have a discussion with the same goal, i.e. more jobs for Europe, in a social context that we are proud to be living in.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Neelie Kroes, Member of the Commission . Mr President, I count my blessings tonight. I conclude that there is not that much difference between political views on this issue. I congratulate the rapporteur. The content of the report and the Commission review are in line with what we discussed during this debate.\nI should like to underline that there is no rigid dogma. That was made clear on your side. It is more that we try to give a hook to Member States\u2019 companies, because the aid does not go to the Member States themselves. Via State aid, the Member State gives a hook to those who need a bit of help, instead of just giving them the fish. They want to do it themselves, but they need a little bit of backing.\nMrs in\u2018t Veld and other Members have talked about less and better State aid. She mentioned that that statement by the Commission is appropriate advice, in the opinion of her political group and her personal opinion. I would have been pleased to say that it was my wording, but we got it from the Council. Aid should be less and better. That is what we tried to indicate and that is what the rapporteur put in his report. State aid reform has to be shaped to deliver not only on growth, innovation and employment, but also on a wide range of primarily non-economic issues. We all agree that they are of fundamental importance to our social European model. These include the social and regional cohesion, human capital and cultural diversity rightly mentioned by Mrs van den Burg. However, State aid should be used wisely, because it is taxpayers\u2019 money. We should not compete through State aid by the Member States, because that is the wrong route. It would have a very detrimental effect. We must not allow a subsidy race between the Member States, so there is clearly a need for less aid, and aid that is better targeted.\nOn the specific concerns raised here today, the Commission will do its utmost to improve how the rules work in practice. It will also step up transparency, rightly called for by a number of Members. Aid should be monitored, but in the end it is only through a positive partnership that we will be able to deliver successful State aid reform.\nA couple of Members touched upon the role of the regional aid guidelines and focusing aid on the regions most in need. We discussed this before and it was adopted last year. Again that is not dogmatic, but it takes account of the fact that some need more backing at a particular moment. We want to deliver a fair and balanced package and we discussed that here in December.\nWe will look further at how the State aid rules can be adapted to new financing mechanisms such as public-private partnerships. The same goes for aid for projects of common interest to boost competitiveness and technological innovation. The question of innovation has been raised. I have just read an article by Professor Getz, saying that innovation should not just be developed in the research and development department of a company, it should be at all levels, from bottom to top. That is an interesting philosophy that could be considered when we are talking about how to boost innovation.\nTurning to SMEs, when we look at the 25 Member States, 92% of all the enterprises in the European Union are in the category of small and medium-sized enterprises. So when we talk about creating jobs and economic growth, we have to bear in mind that the vast majority fall within the category of small and medium-sized enterprises. That is what we are trying to take into account when we talk about giving them more attention than they have received up to now and to stimulate innovation and cooperation between, sometimes, a combination of research institutes, smaller companies and larger companies. It is a challenge to ensure that all those SMEs can take advantage of these opportunities.\nIt has rightly been mentioned that risk capital is not very developed in Europe. Compared to the United States, quite often innovative ideas are not taken up by companies that are small or just starting up because there is no backing from the banks. State aid to back those companies in their early development could be very helpful.\nMr Wortmann-Kool asked whether the Commission could raise the threshold. I am not saying that we would not be prepared to raise it. However, we should bear in mind that we are talking about SMEs and not large companies, and we should try to reduce bureaucracy and red tape. The amount of euros we are talking about really covers that category.

The user provided a debate summary about State Aid Reform from 2006 and wants the main points from Neelie Kroes. First, I need to check the summary to find any mentions of her.\n\nLooking through the sections, there's a part under \"Core Reform Philosophy\" where Commissioner Neelie Kroes is mentioned. She endorsed the approach of \"less and better-targeted State aid,\" emphasizing that state aid is taxpayers' money and needs to be explained to those who get it. She also warned against a subsidy race between member states. \n\nWait, the user specified to only include points attributed to the speaker, which in this case is Neelie Kroes. The summary mentions her twice: once in the Core Reform Philosophy and once in the Commissioner's Response. But the user's query is about her contributions. The Core section says she \"fully endorsed this approach\" and her quotes. Then in the Commissioner's Response, she's quoted again. However, the user's instruction is to outline the main points or arguments made by the speaker, so I need to extract her specific arguments.\n\nSo her main points would be: 1) Supporting the principle of less and better-targeted state aid. 2) Emphasizing that state aid is taxpayers' money and needs transparency. 3) Warning against a subsidy race among member states. \n\nI need to make sure not to include other speakers' points. The user also mentioned that if there are no points, return an empty string, but here there are points.

The only mention of \"President\" is in the speaker name query, but the debate summary doesn't attribute any statements to the President. \n\nSo, since there's no information about the President's contributions in the debate summary provided, the answer should be an empty string.
