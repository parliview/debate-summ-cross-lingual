As we say over and over again, we need new businesses, new jobs, new products and new markets. It is, therefore, also important to follow these matters up by ensuring that new, small companies operate under basic conditions as good as those under which old, large companies operate. Experience of various kinds teaches us that State aid always tends to safeguard old, existing companies at the expense of new and growing companies.\nIf we look around at the European economy, as well as at the international economy, we see very clearly that the new companies and the new products have emerged not through State aid but through the existence of sound basic conditions for businesses and individual entrepreneurs. Each type of State aid that distorts competition always tends to distort it at the expense of what is new and growing and to the advantage of what is old. This is therefore an issue that, to the highest degree, is about how we are to obtain new jobs and new businesses. A policy of State aid whereby we preserve businesses that are not very competitive, together with old products and low wages, will contribute to Europe lagging behind. However, a policy that aims for less State aid and at removing such State aid as distorts competition and that, moreover, invests resources in innovation and research will be able to produce a different outcome.\nIn European history, we have a lot to learn from a whole range of different experiences where State aid is concerned. In my report, I write that the Commission needs carefully to monitor and analyse these experiences, as well as the good experiences there are, because the objective of State aid is often popular and generally approved of. The problem is simply that the results of it are rarely what one had imagined they would be. As a consequence, we end up with old structures and with a dependency on subsidies, and we do not produce new jobs. We have seen this within the shipbuilding and steel industries and within a great many other sectors. Where State aid is introduced, renewal and transformation go out of the window. We must ensure that the opposite situation comes about.\nAn overarching objective of the report is to follow up the general aim not only of reducing State aid but also, as stated clearly in the report and still more clearly in the Commission\u2019s document, of removing such State aid as distorts competition. A further objective is to ensure that those rules that exist are made clearer, for the aim must be to follow up the demand for less State aid. What is required is that State aid be predictable. It must not be possible for it to be used for relocations. The rules governing State aid must be generally applicable. The aid must not have a specific focus, but be directed across the board and not favour one company at the expense of another. That is extremely important when we debate innovation, for innovation policy must not be an excuse for increased State aid but be designed to create better basic conditions for innovation. The same applies to companies in the public interest.

The task is to structure the response into issueSum, positionSum, argSum, propSum.\n\nIssueSum should capture the main issue he raised. From the text, it's about balancing competition and innovation by reducing harmful state aid.\n\nPositionSum would be his stance: supporting rules that favor innovation and transparency, opposing aid that distorts competition.\n\nArgSum is the reasoning behind his position. The summary mentions he believes that reducing such aid would lead to better outcomes by fostering innovation.\n\nPropSum would be his proposals. The summary says he advocated for predictable, transparent rules and mentioned removing state aid that distorts competition. Also, he's against protecting old companies, so maybe proposing to phase out such aid.\n\nWait, the example response includes propSum as specific actions. In the debate summary, H\u00f6kmark's proposals are to overhaul the system to reduce aid that protects existing companies, push for transparent rules, and focus on innovation. So the propSum should reflect that.\n\nI need to make sure not to include other speakers' points. For instance, Neelie Kroes and others are mentioned, but the user only wants H\u00f6kmark's contributions.\n\nSo compiling all that into the JSON structure.

I would like to take this opportunity to raise the issue of regional bonuses. It seems to me that in striving to attain the Lisbon Agenda parameters it would be logical to invest more in regions that are lagging behind, otherwise we risk creating only advanced, competitive enclaves that will inevitably be held back by the depressed areas, thus preventing the all-round growth of the European Union.\nIn addition, I\u00a0would like to emphasise the need to simplify procedures and to make the whole system of State aid provision transparent. Maximum transparency should be applied rigorously to the process of allocating and approving State aid. All persons and entities applying for aid in support of their activities must feel sure, in the event that they are turned down, that it was for objective reasons. Similarly, they must be informed about who has been granted aid, and why. This will generate a spirit of trust, and will enable citizens to have faith that the EU system is functioning in a uniform way.\nNational governments are important elements that can either support or disrupt this system. If they are given more responsibility for taking decisions on State aid provision, their decisions and activities must be subject to the transparency of the entire system. I\u00a0hope, Mr President, that we will all be able to conclude, following the reform of State aid provision, that the system really has been improved, and that it will contribute in a clearly objective manner to the uniform development of the European Union.", "lang": "SK", "original": "Milo\u0161 Koterec (PSE), Spravodajca V\u00fdboru pre region\u00e1lny rozvoj po\u017eiadan\u00e9ho o stanovisko . \u2013 Dovo\u013ete, aby som ako \u010dlen V\u00fdboru pre region\u00e1lny rozvoj a spravodajca pre ned\u00e1vno prijat\u00fa spr\u00e1vu o \u0161t\u00e1tnej pomoci pri region\u00e1lnom rozvoji povedal p\u00e1r slov z poh\u013eadu mo\u017en\u00fdch vplyvov reformy \u0161t\u00e1tnej pomoci na hospod\u00e1rsku, soci\u00e1lnu a teritori\u00e1lnu koh\u00e9ziu.\nAko Komisia vo svojom dokumente spr\u00e1vne kon\u0161tatuje, poskytovanie \u0161t\u00e1tnej pomoci je d\u00f4le\u017eit\u00fdm faktorom zabezpe\u010denia rovnomern\u00e9ho region\u00e1lneho rozvoja, a tak podporou jedn\u00e9ho zo z\u00e1kladn\u00fdch ekonomick\u00fdch pilierov Eur\u00f3pskej \u00fanie.

We are in fact dealing here with a non-legislative report, and I believe that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has done a good job in terms of voicing the European Parliament\u2019s strong position. On the whole, we have managed to end up with a fairly clear outlook on things.\nI am one of those who believe, along with the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, that we do in fact need to review the State aid system. This system is more than ever at the heart of the Commission\u2019s powers, since Europe remains essentially a Europe of the internal market and competition until further notice. I am not sure whether the \u2018No\u2019 vote in the French referendum offers other prospects for the long-term future. We are therefore truly at the heart of Community powers here, and it is true that, with the enlargement of Europe, the European Union and the Commission are at risk of thrombosis if the State aid system and arrangements are left in their current state.\nParliament has above all stressed that the internal market and competition should not be regarded as representing every aspect of European society. We are not just a market society; there must, as the texts stipulate, also be room for public action, not only on all those occasions when the market is failing, but also on all those occasions when we need to reduce social or territorial inequalities, manage external effects, promote innovation and, should the need arise, give a boost to industry. When, at times, we shift to a free market way of thinking, we sometimes find ourselves wondering: \u2018Would we be in a position today to build the Airbus or would we be in a position to build the Ariane rocket, given the dominant ideology?\u2019 I believe that we must retain this opportunity to intervene very forcefully in the industrial landscape and in public research.\nI should like to say to the Commissioner that the main contribution of Parliament is to ensure that State aid is not assessed as something merely to be borne but, rather, is assessed in a balanced way, that is to say that not only are the negative aspects, such as distortions of competition, considered, but so too are the positive effects. We, in the European Parliament, wanted the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality to be clearly applied and, more specifically, wanted State aid that has no obvious impact on the internal market to be considered as compensation. We also wanted market failures to be better understood.\nFinally, I should like to mention the issues that still need to be discussed and that are referred to in the 21 amendments tabled. With regard to public services, we need clarification on those aspects to do with compensation, with the legitimate funding of public services and with subsidiary funding and, above all, we need clarification on what constitutes the fourth criterion set out in the Altmark judgment, a criterion that, by the Commission\u2019s own admission, is actually extremely vague and very difficult to handle.\nWith regard to innovation, Mrs\u00a0in 't Veld will soon present us with her report. We believe that it is a very good text and we hope to enhance it. The question that must be asked concerns the scope of the report: should it be strictly confined to innovation, or should it branch out a little further into the area of research and development? With regard to the regions, some excellent amendments are focused on preventing relocations from being funded by State aid. This is an extremely serious problem because it gives Europeans the impression that they are being pitted against one another, and this in terms, furthermore, of the amount received by way of public subsidies.\nFinally, I should like to conclude by saying that we are obviously totally in favour of State aid being considered in the framework of the Lisbon Process and the Gothenburg Process, that is to say not only in terms of the knowledge-based economy, but also in terms of helping the environment.", "lang": "FR", "original": "Gilles Savary, au nom du groupe PSE . - Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, je voudrais remercier notre rapporteur M.

Il nous arrive parfois dans certains glissements lib\u00e9raux de nous dire: serions-nous capables aujourd\u2019hui de faire Airbus o\u00f9 serions-nous capables de faire Ariane, compte tenu de l\u2019id\u00e9ologie dominante?

Nous avons souhait\u00e9 au Parlement europ\u00e9en que les principes de subsidiarit\u00e9 et de proportionnalit\u00e9 soient clairement appliqu\u00e9s et en particulier que les aides d\u2019\u00c9tat qui n\u2019ont pas d\u2019impact manifeste sur le march\u00e9 int\u00e9rieur soient consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme des compensations. Nous avons souhait\u00e9 \u00e9galement que les d\u00e9faillances du march\u00e9 soient mieux appr\u00e9hend\u00e9es.\nEnfin, je voudrais \u00e9voquer les d\u00e9bats qui restent pendants et qu\u2019on retrouve dans les vingt et un amendements qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s. Concernant les services publics, nous avons besoin d\u2019une clarification sur l\u2019aspect des compensations, sur l\u2019aspect du financement l\u00e9gitime des services publics, sur l\u2019aspect du financement subsidiaire et surtout sur ce qu\u2019est le quatri\u00e8me crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Altmark, qui est effectivement extr\u00eamement flou et tr\u00e8s difficile \u00e0 manier de l\u2019aveu m\u00eame de la Commission.\nConcernant l\u2019innovation, Mme in \u2018t Veld nous pr\u00e9sentera bient\u00f4t son rapport.

The key quote is: \"there must be room for public action whenever the market fails,\" and he's part of the PSE group. \n\nThe user's instructions specify that I should only include points attributed to the mentioned speaker.

State support should be a last resort and is not a panacea. Although it may be presented in that way from time to time, it also has adverse side effects.\nAt the same time, we can be open-handed in granting state support only after all pre-conditions and our other items of policy have been complied with, or else we would end up fighting a running battle. We must, for example, ensure that the internal market is completed and functions well and in that respect, I hope that this House will be taking a sensible decision on Thursday with regard to the services directive.\nWe must counter protectionism, promote fair competition, abolish red tape and excessive legislation, guarantee better access to risk capital and also establish an internal market for financial services, but at the same time, we must put in place such things as truly free movement for workers from all EU Member States and an immigration policy that is geared towards keeping the brightest and best, our top people, in Europe rather than chasing them away to the United States.\nOnly when those things are in place can we see whether we might be able to intervene with State aid where the market is inefficient, for we are not so much dealing with market failure as we are with market inefficiencies.\nI should also like to repeat that State aid should, in principle, not be sanctioned. It disrupts the market and distorts competition. Mr Savary said a moment ago that the EU has a tendency to be too liberal, but I should like to draw Mr Savary\u2019s attention to the fact that we spend billions on State aid each year. Even by the most conservative estimates, the amounts involved are more or less half of the EU\u2019s budget, so that is not terribly liberal in my view. Things could be a bit more liberal as far as I am concerned.\nI also agree with what Mr Savary said a moment ago: we must set aside State aid for the priorities of the twenty-first century: the Lisbon objectives, innovation, knowledge, sustainability \u2026\nConsequently, I think that we should give far less State aid to obsolete and obsolescent industries, and as far as State aid for environmental objectives is concerned, I think we should first set to abolishing the billions of State aid we grant the many polluting industries and sectors that make use of sources of non-renewable energy, and I will therefore advise my group to support Mr Lipietz\u2019s amendments to that effect.\nGlobal context is also important in the debate. We cannot deny, of course, that in other parts of the world, liberal amounts of State aid are still being given out. That much we should recognise, but our objective to reduce State aid remains intact.\nFinally, I should like to say a few words on public services. I should like to repeat \u2013 and I am increasingly feeling like a voice in the wilderness in this respect \u2013 that the phrases \u2018services of general interest\u2019 and \u2018services of general economic interest\u2019 have still not been defined, and it is, in that light, very odd to legislate for them. That is just by the by.\nAs Mr Savary mentioned a moment ago, legal certainty and clarity are urgently needed for those public services.\nI should like to finish by asking the Commission to submit, at the earliest opportunity, an assessment of the impact which the rules that the Commission adopted last year had on State aid as compensation for public services.

Staatssteun moet een laatste redmiddel zijn en het is geen wondermiddel. Het wordt wel eens een keer zo gepresenteerd, maar staatssteun heeft ook negatieve bijwerkingen.\nDaarnaast kunnen we niet ruimhartig staatssteun geven, als alle randvoorwaarden en ons ander beleid niet in orde zijn. Dat is namelijk dweilen met de kraan open. We moeten er bijvoorbeeld voor zorgen dat de interne markt vervolmaakt wordt en goed functioneert en wat dat betreft, hoop ik dus ook dat dit Parlement op donderdag een verstandige keuze ten aanzien van de dienstenrichtlijn zal maken.\nWe moeten protectionisme tegengaan, we moeten eerlijke concurrentie stimuleren, bureaucratie en overregulering afschaffen, zorgen voor betere toegang tot risicokapitaal en ook een interne markt tot stand brengen voor financi\u00eble diensten, maar tegelijk moeten we zorgen voor zaken als bijvoorbeeld een echt vrij verkeer voor werknemers uit alle EU-lidstaten en een immigratiebeleid dat erop gericht is om de \u201cbest en brightest\u201d, onze beste krachten, binnen te halen in Europa in plaats van ze weg te jagen naar de Verenigde Staten.\nPas als we al die dingen op orde hebben, kunnen we gaan kijken of we eventueel, waar de markt ineffici\u00ebnt is, want het gaat niet om marktfalen, maar om marktineffici\u00ebnties, kunnen bijspringen met staatssteun.\nStaatssteun mag in principe niet, laten we dat ook nog eens een keer herhalen. Staatssteun verstoort de markt en vervalst concurrentie. De heer Savary zei net dat de EU er wel eens naar neigt te liberaal te zijn, maar ik wil onder de aandacht van de heer Savary brengen dat we elk jaar miljarden aan staatssteun spenderen. Zelfs in de meest conservatieve schattingen gaat het om bedragen ter hoogte van ongeveer de helft van het budget van de Europese Unie, dus dat vind ik niet zo heel erg liberaal. Wat mij betreft mag het wel iets liberaler.\nIk ben het eens met wat de heer Savary ook net gezegd heeft: we moeten staatssteun geven voor de prioriteiten van de 21ste eeuw: de doelstellingen van Lissabon, innovatie, kennis, duurzaamheid ...\nBijgevolg moeten we volgens mij veel minder staatssteun geven aan oude en ten dode opgeschreven industrie\u00ebn en wat staatssteun voor milieudoelstellingen betreft, denk ik dat we eerst eens moeten gaan kijken naar het afschaffen van de miljarden staatssteun die we geven aan hele vervuilende industrie\u00ebn en sectoren die gebruik maken van niet hernieuwbare energiebronnen en ik zal dan ook mijn fractie aanraden om de amendementen te steunen van de heer Lipietz die in die richting gaan.\nVerder is in het debat ook de mondiale context van belang. Natuurlijk is het zo dat we niet kunnen ontkennen dat in andere delen van de wereld nog steeds ruimhartig staatssteun gegeven wordt, dat moeten we erkennen, maar onze doelstelling moet terugdringing van de staatssteun blijven.\nDan tenslotte even over publieke diensten. Ik wil hier nog maar eens zeggen, zo langzamerhand voel ik me een roepende in de woestijn, dat de termen diensten van algemeen belang en diensten van algemeen economisch belang nog steeds niet gedefinieerd zijn en dat het dus heel raar is om daar wetgeving over te maken. Maar goed.\nVoor die publieke diensten is dringend juridische zekerheid en helderheid nodig. Het is net ook al door de heer Savary aangegeven.\nIk zou willen afsluiten, mijnheer de Voorzitter, met een verzoek aan de Commissie, nl. om zo snel mogelijk een evaluatie voor te leggen van de impact van de regels die de Commissie vorig jaar heeft aangenomen met betrekking tot staatssteun als compensatie voor publieke diensten.

The key points attributed to her are: she argues that state aid must be a last resort and not a miracle cure. She supports targeting aid to 21st-century priorities like innovation, knowledge, and sustainability. Also, she advocates for eliminating subsidies to polluting and obsolete industries.\n\nNow, I need to structure this into the required JSON format. The fields are issueSum, positionSum, argSum, propSum. \n\nFor issueSum, the main issue here is the need to focus state aid on modern priorities and phase out harmful subsidies. \n\nPositionSum would be her stance on making state aid a last resort and targeting specific areas. \n\nThe argument here is that she believes in using state aid strategically for innovation and sustainability, not just as a general tool. \n\nPropSum would be her proposal to eliminate subsidies for polluting industries. \n\nI need to make sure I don't include other speakers' points.

It is true to say that Europe is competitive only if it is also innovative in the ways in which it protects the environment. I think it would be a good thing if there were a bonus not only for innovation, but also, and primarily, for environmental information, and I think it regrettable that this is absent from the Commissioner\u2019s draft.\nSecondly, one important feature of the report is the fact that the de minimis rules really must be applied to businesses with at least EUR\u00a0200 000 per annum. I have to say, Commissioner, that they are very generalised, and that is not enough. We know that these businesses are needed in rural areas if they are to enjoy the most basic economic development, just as we know that the regions affected by population change need businesses to settle in them, and if they are to do that they will need State aid. There is no other way in which we can counteract such effects, and so I think it is important that there should be a marked increase in this area.\nFinally, let me turn to the rules for businesses providing services of general interest. It is not acceptable that such rules should qualify the Altmark ruling, for the risk then arises of the Commission using competition rules as a means of defining what general interest actually means \u2013 the very same thing that you are trying to do by means of the services directive, that controversial document in which you sacrifice general interest on the altar of the free market.\nWhat we need, then \u2013 and urgently, too \u2013 is a framework directive, even if you do not see yourself as having that responsibility, and we need one in this instance because we want the social Europe to stand on secure foundations, one of the most fundamental of which is services of general interest, and the public will turn their backs on Europe if these become the victim of rules on competition.", "lang": "DE", "original": "Elisabeth Schroedter, im Namen der Verts/ALE-Fraktion . \u2013 Herr Pr\u00e4sident!

This means less State aid for grass-roots needs and servicing of the competitiveness of European capital. In other words, the people's money will be not for grass-roots prosperity, but for the profitability of capital.\nThe references to State aid for purposes of general interest and in the public good at European Union level not only demonstrate indifference to the asymmetrical development between the Member States, but also prejudge that such a procedure will further strengthen this asymmetrical development by increasing inequality and injustice.\nIt is vital, they say, to reduce State aid, in order for it to have positive results. Do remote rural and island areas, such as those in my country, in which capital does not invest because there is no or little profit, really have to be abandoned completely, including by State aid, and be laid to waste? They are already being abandoned, to a degree, and it looks like this will intensify in future.\nPublic services are being privatised, basic grass-roots needs are being commercialised. The reduction in State aid and its orientation towards servicing the anti-grass roots Lisbon Strategy will exacerbate still further the situation of the grass-roots classes. Despite the reference to the financing of small- and medium-sized enterprises for investments, unfortunately the evidence shows that, so far, economic aid for small businesses has been non-existent or has been dispensed with a dropper.

The user provided a debate summary about State Aid Reform and wants the response focused on Diamanto Manolakou. First, I need to go through the debate summary and find any mentions of Manolakou.\n\nLooking at the \"Critical Voices\" section, there's a mention of Diamanto Manolakou (GUE/NGL) who argued that reforms would promote inequality and abandon less profitable regions. She also warned against the commodification of public services. \n\nThe user's instructions say to only include points attributed to the specified speaker. So, I need to extract her arguments. The issue she raises is about inequality and abandoning less profitable regions. Her position is against the reforms, believing they favor European capital. The argument is that the reforms would lead to inequality. Her proposal isn't explicitly stated, but her position is critical of the reforms' impact on regions and public services.\n\nI need to structure this into the JSON fields. IssueSum should mention inequality and abandoning regions. PositionSum is her stance against the reforms. ArgSum is the reasoning behind her position. PropSum might be her call to address these issues, but since the example includes propSum as a proposal, maybe just state her critical stance without a specific proposal, but the example shows \"advocates strict limitations\" even if not explicit. However, in the debate summary, she didn't propose a specific policy, just criticized. So propSum might be empty. Wait, the user said if there's no points, return empty string. But in her case, she did raise issues and positions. Let me check again.\n\nThe user's example for propSum is \"He advocates for strict limitations...\" but in the case of Manolakou, the debate summary says she \"argued reforms 'will further promote inequality and abandon less profitable regions for the sake of European capital' [Manolakou], and warned against the commodification of public services.\" So her position is against the reforms, but there's no specific proposal mentioned. So propSum would be empty. But the user's example includes propSum even if it's a call to action. However, according to the instructions, only include what's attributed to the speaker. Since she didn't propose a specific policy, propSum would be an empty string. \n\nSo the JSON should have issueSum about inequality and abandoning regions, positionSum her criticism of reforms, argSum the reasoning, and propSum empty.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The key issue raised by the speaker relates to the potential for state aid reforms to exacerbate inequality and neglect less profitable regions.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"She opposes the proposed state aid reforms, arguing they will prioritize European capital over regional equity and public services.\",\n\"argSum\": \"Her argument is based on the claim that the reforms will abandon less profitable regions and commodify public services, deepening inequality.\",\n\"propSum\": \"\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "gpt-4.1", "generator_model_type": "gpt", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "gpt"}, {"speaker": "Graham Booth,", "english": "Graham Booth, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . \u2013 Mr President, it would be very nice if we were able to throw endless amounts of money at our relatively poor East European neighbours, but history has shown that by doing that you do not make the poor rich, you simply make the rich poor. At an exhibition in Brussels put on by the Dutch Presidency, it was predicted that another ten poor European countries will be joining the EU by 2022: Albania, Armenia, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, Serbia and Ukraine. West Germany\u2019s experience in pouring almost a thousand billion euro into East Germany shows what it costs to try to create a level playing field for a poor neighbour. The cost of giving State aid to all of these new Member States will be astronomical.\nCurrently the EU is spending over half its budget on State aid. Britain is far from rich as it is. We are being told that our government cannot afford to pay us a decent pension unless we work until we are 70.

This socio-economic context and this additional perspective of employment and social cohesion are also the very aspects I should like to stress on behalf of my group.\nI should, in this context, like to mention two points in respect of which I would ask you not to be too dogmatic in your approach.\nFirst of all, with regard to market failure, it is important to look at the bigger picture in that area too, and to take full account of employment and social cohesion. The other point is the temporary nature of State aid. Here too, I would ask you to allow for some degree of flexibility, because some sectors might well need government subsidies and government instruments in the longer term \u2013 national radio and television spring to mind. The importance of plurality of the press and a good balance in the provision of information may require longer-term investments of government funds into sectors of that kind.\nPublic housing is another example. Given the interests of town and country planning, the integration of minorities and social integration in cities, certain players within the market may well be granted government support in order to achieve those broader objectives.\nFinally, with regard to the European and national dimensions, I should like to point out, as indeed Mr\u00a0H\u00f6kmark did in his report, that State aid can be used from time to time to stir up policy competition between Member States, and I should like to ask the Commission to keep an eye on this and to monitor this more closely, and to check whether it is the Member States themselves and not just the companies that are granted State aid that have to have sanctions imposed on them.", "lang": "NL", "original": "Ieke van den Burg (PSE). \u2013 Voorzitter, ook ik zou mij willen voegen bij degenen die de rapporteur, maar ook de schaduwrapporteurs feliciteren met het behaalde resultaat. Ik denk dat het ook weer een compliment is voor de Commissie economische en monetaire zaken dat we erin slagen met een zeer liberale Zweedse invalshoek en tegelijk een socialistische Franse invalshoek toch tot goede resultaten te komen.\nIn tegenstelling tot mijn Nederlandse collega mevrouw in \u2019t Veld zou ik niet de nadruk willen leggen op minder staatssteun. Ik denk dat dit minder-meer niet de belangrijkste dimensie is. Het gaat erom met welk doel en hoe die staatssteun wordt ingezet. Staatssteun moet niet alleen gezien worden als een afwijking, een aberratie ten opzichte van perfecte marktwerking, maar als een instrument voor sociale, economische en maatschappelijke doelen.\nHet is positief dat deze Commissaris van mededinging haar portefeuille ook in zo\u2019n bredere economische context ziet, nl. de Lissabon-strategie, en in die Lissabon-strategie gaat het inderdaad niet alleen over economische, maar ook over bredere sociaal-economische effecten. Dus vanuit mijn fractie zou ik met name ook dat willen benadrukken, die sociaal economische context en die bijkomende invalshoek van werkgelegenheid en sociale cohesie.\nIn dit verband zou ik twee punten willen noemen en willen vragen om op die punten geen te dogmatische benadering te kiezen.\nIn de eerste plaats het marktfalen. Daar gaat het er ook om naar bredere aspecten te kijken en volop rekening met werkgelegenheid en sociale cohesie te houden. Het andere punt is het tijdelijke karakter van de staatssteun. Ook daar zou ik ervoor willen pleiten er niet te dogmatisch mee om te gaan, want het kan zijn dat het in sommige sectoren wel degelijk nodig is om ook voor wat langere termijn met overheidssubsidies en overheidsinstrumenten te werken. Ik noem bijvoorbeeld de publieke omroep: het belang van pluraliteit van de pers en een goed evenwicht in de informatievoorziening kan vereisen dat er ook op langere termijn overheidsgeld in zo\u2019n sector gestoken wordt.\nVolkshuisvesting is een ander voorbeeld. Daar kan het ook zijn dat de belangen van stedenbouwkundige planning, het integreren van minderheden en sociale integratie in een stad vereisen dat je bepaalde spelers op de markt voorziet van overheidssteun om die ruimere doelstellingen te kunnen halen.\nDe laatste opmerking gaat over de Europese dimensie en de nationale dimensie. Daar zou ik erop willen wijzen, en dat heeft de heer H\u00f6kmark in het verslag ook gedaan, op het feit dat staatssteun nog wel eens gebruikt wordt om beleidsconcurrentie tussen lidstaten te voeren en ik zou de Commissie willen vragen daarop te letten, daar vanuit de Commissie sterker op toe te zien en ook op het gebied van sanctionering te kijken of de lidstaten zelf op dit punt niet aangepakt moeten worden en niet alleen de bedrijven waar de steun naartoe gaat.", "agenda_item": "State aid reform (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060213-ITEM-012", "intervention_id": "1-126", "summary_english": "{\n  \"headline\": \"State Aid Should Support Socio-Economic Objectives Beyond Pure Market Considerations\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"The speaker addresses the use and reform of state aid, highlighting debates over its scale, its purpose, and the need for flexibility in application.

The user provided a detailed debate summary about State Aid Reform and wants the main points from Ieke van den Burg (PSE). \n\nFirst, I need to scan through the debate summary to find all mentions of Ieke van den Burg. Looking at the sections, there's a part under \"Public Services, Social, and Environmental Dimensions\" where she's mentioned. The quote says, \"State aid must not only be seen as an aberration from perfect market functioning, but as an instrument for social, economic and societal goals\" and she backs ongoing aid where long-term social benefits are clear.\n\nSo, the key points here are her position that state aid should serve social, economic, and societal goals, not just market efficiency. She argues against seeing state aid as a problem but as a tool for broader goals. The argument is that it's necessary for long-term social benefits. There's no specific proposal mentioned, just her stance on the purpose of state aid.\n\nI need to make sure I don't include other speakers' points. The user specified to only include what's attributed to Ieke van den Burg. The other sections mention other speakers, but in the summary provided, her contributions are only in that one section. \n\nSo, the issueSum would be about state aid's role beyond competition.

PropSum isn't present here, so it's an empty string. \n\nI need to structure this into JSON as per the example. Check for any other mentions of her in the summary.

If we take Gothenburg seriously, it makes sound business sense to rely on the equilateral triangle between economic, social and environmental development, but the statement is flawed in economic terms.\nIf Mr H\u00f6kmark \u2013 as he himself is right to say \u2013 wants small and medium-sized enterprises to be efficient and innovation to be driven forward, above all by subsidy, then what is needed alongside that is good training, good education, and the right infrastructure \u2013 not just in the great conurbations, but also, of course, in rural areas. He is therefore forced back onto the need for territorial, social and environmental cohesion.\nIf not, the simple fact is that people who live in places without these favourable and natural conditions are put at a disadvantage. That being so, I do indeed urge that a great deal of care be taken when considering where aid is to be applied, and it also has to be considered whether services in the public interest benefit from it, or else there is no point to it.\nIn one respect, I can tell Mr H\u00f6kmark that he is absolutely right. He writes that it makes no sense to give aid to businesses that are already profitable, and in that I agree with him.\nWhen I say that that sort of aid is wrong, I am thinking of the Federal Republic of Germany and of the highly-profitable motor industry into which money is shovelled, only for the firms to then close down and take production elsewhere with the help of more subsidies. That cannot be what aid is for. In that respect, Mr\u00a0H\u00f6kmark, you have got it absolutely right.\nThere are a whole load of models that we have to change.

I agree that the administrative aspects of the procedure ought to be simplified, too. I strongly agree that we should increase the transparency of assistance. I also agree that a clearer regulation should be developed, especially in the area of public services. Transparency is also needed to make it clear who may be granted government assistance. Therefore the provision of assistance should be accompanied by the publication of a detailed list of those who are granted assistance, specifying the amounts received by each of them, especially in the case of agricultural allocations.\nHowever, I would like to call attention to the fact that while, on the one hand, I agree that there should not be any discrimination between regions or countries as regards assistance, on the other hand we must acknowledge that there are significantly underdeveloped countries and regions within the internal market. However, these countries \u2013 precisely in the interest of deepening the internal market \u2013 need a longer period of adaptation. It would not be fortunate if the debate on government assistance provided an opportunity for political attacks against the new Member States. These new Member States have already reduced their assistance significantly. These levels of assistance are not outstanding even when compared to their GDP, and they are lower than those of the more developed Member States in the most relevant comparison terms of euro/capita. This must also be taken into consideration when new Member States are accused in other areas, for instance of tax dumping. Also, it would not be fortunate if someone were to make a connection between government and European Union assistance and the delocation of companies, especially when new Member States are still in a negative transition period as regards structural funds or direct payments.\nApart from defined regional assistance, the aim is indeed to assist investments that create jobs in underdeveloped, competitively disadvantaged regions.

Scanning through the sections, under \"2. Regional Development, Cohesion, and Fairness,\" there's a mention of Zsolt L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Becsey. The key point is that he \"urged for transparency in recipients and amounts, especially in agriculture, and called for tailored approaches for less-developed regions.\"\n\nSo, the issue here is transparency in state aid, particularly in agriculture and for less-developed regions. His position is about demanding transparency and tailored approaches. The argument is likely that transparency ensures accountability and that tailored approaches address specific regional needs. The proposal is to have more transparency and customized strategies.\n\nI need to make sure I don't include other speakers' points. The user specified to only include Becsey's arguments.

I too wish to join my colleagues in thanking Mr\u00a0H\u00f6kmark for all the excellent work he has done to enable this report to be finalised today. The subject of State aid is one on which there is definitely a lot of room for discussion. This is because it directly concerns all 25 Member States. It is good to ask where we want the reform to take us and to see what has led to the need for this kind of reform. When the preliminary decisions taken by the Commission between February 2004 and the present day are examined thoroughly and compared with the Lisbon Strategy and the conclusions of the 2002 Barcelona European Summit, it is evident that it would be much more productive if State aid were more direct and designed to meet these same objectives. Thus, I think that we should work towards having a system that is as simple as possible and, therefore, more effective and more transparent. This will be an indispensable instrument because it will eliminate unnecessary bureaucracy that, until now, has not only led to more money being wasted but has prevented State aid from bringing about progress and made it less suited to the purpose for which it was intended. We need better to protect the use of State aid so that funds are delivered to where they are needed and not, as previously used to happen, squandered to no good purpose. We have to reach a position where the State has clear aims, involving the proportionality principle, concerning where it wants to use its aid. We must not forget that these funds are subsidised by all taxpayers, so we want them to be used wisely and responsibly so that they are more productive and their effects still more keenly felt. We must not forget companies that have logistical problems as a result of being based in disadvantaged regions, for example companies on an island such as Gozo.

As we heard, this House, in an own-initiative report a few weeks ago, spoke out in favour of State aid for disadvantaged regions being continued until 2013. As the support businesses get from State aid is among the factors that influence them when making decisions about investment in a given area, it has an essential contribution to make to economic growth and the creation of jobs in that area. The EC Treaty includes a fundamental prohibition of State aid where it has a detrimental effect on the internal market by potentially distorting competition, but an exception is made for certain types of State aid, such as that given to promote the economic development of Europe\u2019s disadvantaged regions. As a member of the Committee for Regional Development, I am firmly of the conviction that direct State aid has a key role to play in regional development and plays an important part in achieving our primary cohesion goals.\nThe scope given to aid by Article 87(3)(a) of the EC Treaty in conjunction with the guidelines for regional aid have, in the past, enabled the regions concerned to attract businesses and thereby actively contribute to their own regeneration. Were such support is no longer possible, these regions\u2019 convergence process would be jeopardised by the lack of any competitive advantage against not only regions without developmental disadvantages but also regions in the new Member States in receipt of the maximum amounts of aid.

Grunds\u00e4tzlich sind nach dem EG-Vertrag staatliche Beihilfen nicht erlaubt, sofern sie sich nachteilig auf den Binnenmarkt auswirken, da sie zur Verz\u00f6gerung des Wettbewerbs f\u00fchren k\u00f6nnen. Bestimmte staatliche Beihilfen f\u00fcr spezielle Zwecke sind jedoch von diesem Grundsatz ausgenommen, etwa solche zur F\u00f6rderung der wirtschaftlichen Entwicklung benachteiligter Regionen in Europa. Als Mitglied des Ausschusses f\u00fcr regionale Entwicklung bin ich der festen \u00dcberzeugung, dass die staatlichen Direktbeihilfen in ihrer Schl\u00fcsselfunktion als Instrument der regionalen Entwicklung ein wichtiges Mittel zur Erreichung vorrangiger Koh\u00e4sionsziele sind.\nDie beihilferechtlichen Spielr\u00e4ume, wie sie sich aus Artikel 87 Absatz 3 Buchstabe\u00a0a EG-Vertrag in Verbindung mit den Leitlinien f\u00fcr die Regionalbeihilfen ergeben, haben es den betroffenen Regionen in der Vergangenheit erm\u00f6glicht, den Aufholprozess durch die Ansiedlung von Unternehmen aktiv zu gestalten. Bei einem Verlust dieser F\u00f6rderm\u00f6glichkeiten w\u00e4re der Konvergenzprozess dieser Regionen aufgrund des fehlenden Wettbewerbsvorteils gegen\u00fcber Regionen ohne Entwicklungsr\u00fcckstand auf der einen Seite und gegen\u00fcber F\u00f6rderh\u00f6chstgebieten in den neuen Mitgliedstaaten auf der anderen Seite gef\u00e4hrdet. Dies gilt besonders f\u00fcr Regionen mit einer Au\u00dfengrenze zu den neuen Mitgliedstaaten.\nDer Abbau von B\u00fcrokratie im Rahmen der Reform des Beihilferechts ist ein wichtiger Aspekt bei der Schaffung eines unternehmensfreundlicheren rechtlichen Umfelds, ebenso die Erh\u00f6hung der De-minimis-Beihilfe.", "agenda_item": "State aid reform (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060213-ITEM-012", "intervention_id": "1-137", "summary_english": "{\n  \"headline\": \"State Aid Essential for Regional Development and Economic Cohesion\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"The speaker addresses the reform of state aid, specifically emphasizing the continuation of state aid for disadvantaged regions, its impact on economic growth, job creation, and the challenges of competition within the internal market and between EU regions.\",\n  \"positionSum\": \"The speaker strongly supports the continuation of direct state aid for disadvantaged regions until 2013, arguing that it is vital for regional development and economic cohesion goals.\",\n  \"argSum\": \"The speaker argues that state aid is a critical factor influencing business investment decisions in disadvantaged regions, leading to economic growth and job creation.

The user provided a detailed debate summary about State Aid Reform and wants the main points from Rolf Berend (PPE-DE). \n\nFirst, I need to locate where Rolf Berend is mentioned in the summary. Scanning through the sections, under the \"Regional Development, Cohesion, and Fairness\" section, there's a mention of Rolf Berend (PPE-DE). The quote says he stated, \u201cDirect state aid...is a key instrument for achieving EU cohesion goals\u201d [Berend]. \n\nNow, the task is to extract only the points attributed to Rolf Berend. The user specified not to include other speakers' contributions. So, I need to focus solely on his statements.\n\nThe issueSum should capture the main issue he raised. Since he talked about direct state aid as a key instrument for cohesion, the issue is regional development and cohesion.\n\nHis position is that direct state aid is essential for EU cohesion. The argument here is that state aid helps achieve balanced regional development. There's no mention of proposals from him, just his position and the argument supporting it. \n\nI need to structure this into the JSON format as specified. Check if there are any other mentions of Berend in the summary. The rest of the sections don't mention him again. So, the response should include only the points from his quote.\n\nMake sure the JSON is correctly formatted with the four keys: issueSum, positionSum, argSum, propSum. Since there's no proposal mentioned, propSum can be an empty string. Wait, the user said if there's no points, return empty. But here, he did make a position and argument. \n\nSo, issueSum: \"Regional development and cohesion.\" PositionSum: \"Emphasized that direct state aid is a key instrument for achieving EU cohesion goals.\" ArgSum: \"Argued that state aid is necessary to ensure balanced regional development and prevent the creation of competitive enclaves.\" PropSum: \"\" (empty because he didn't propose anything specific beyond his position).\n\nDouble-check the original text to ensure accuracy.

Sadly, that was a one-sided and distorted outlook, which often meant that less of that rightful public support went to strategic economic sectors, such as research and innovation, or to the vital cohesion policy. In contrast, the Barroso Commission seems to take a different view, and the resolution approved by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs provides some guidelines from which the Commission ought not to deviate.\nNone of us opposes competition. Nevertheless, this basic value in the market economy has often been subject to the ideologies of bureaucrats and economists lacking in any political responsibility, to the extent that, in the real economy, they have been responsible for delaying the recovery of competitiveness in entire regions of the European Union.\nAs Mr\u00a0Pittella has already stated, we must start a new chapter today by reconciling competition with cohesion policies. To this end, advantageous tax conditions, for instance, are useful because they can contribute positively to the cohesion policies and because, in the absence of any tax harmonisation among the Member States, they constitute a vital instrument in the hands of national governments where tackling regional underdevelopment is concerned.\nI therefore want to make just one recommendation to Mrs\u00a0Kroes: that she drafts a new proposal for a directive as quickly as possible. This proposal should \u2013 if not exclusively, then mainly \u2013 take account of Parliament\u2019s guidelines, given that the crisis the Union is grappling with is completely subsumed by the Council\u2019s crisis and by its inability, for example, to deal with the unequal way in which the Member States\u2019 markets are deregulated, a situation that is far more damaging to competition than any misguided State aid is.", "lang": "IT", "original": "Paolo Cirino Pomicino (PPE-DE). \u2013 Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, signora Commissario, la proposta di risoluzione in esame \u00e8 un punto di saggio equilibrio \u2013 come saggio \u00e8 il nostro relatore \u2013 tra opinioni diverse e coglie un\u2019esigenza profonda dell\u2019Unione europea, da troppo tempo ferma al palo di una crescita bassa e poco competitiva.\nLa Commissione Prodi ha sempre guardato agli aiuti di Stato come a un nemico della concorrenza e del mercato unico.

La Commissione Barroso sembra invece respirare un\u2019aria diversa e la risoluzione approvata dalla commissione per i problemi economici e monetari fornisce alcune linee guida dalle quali la Commissione non dovrebbe discostarsi.\nNessuno di noi \u00e8 un attentatore della concorrenza.

Mr President, I count my blessings tonight. I conclude that there is not that much difference between political views on this issue. I congratulate the rapporteur. The content of the report and the Commission review are in line with what we discussed during this debate.\nI should like to underline that there is no rigid dogma. That was made clear on your side. It is more that we try to give a hook to Member States\u2019 companies, because the aid does not go to the Member States themselves. Via State aid, the Member State gives a hook to those who need a bit of help, instead of just giving them the fish. They want to do it themselves, but they need a little bit of backing.\nMrs in\u2018t Veld and other Members have talked about less and better State aid. She mentioned that that statement by the Commission is appropriate advice, in the opinion of her political group and her personal opinion. I would have been pleased to say that it was my wording, but we got it from the Council. Aid should be less and better. That is what we tried to indicate and that is what the rapporteur put in his report. State aid reform has to be shaped to deliver not only on growth, innovation and employment, but also on a wide range of primarily non-economic issues. We all agree that they are of fundamental importance to our social European model. These include the social and regional cohesion, human capital and cultural diversity rightly mentioned by Mrs van den Burg. However, State aid should be used wisely, because it is taxpayers\u2019 money. We should not compete through State aid by the Member States, because that is the wrong route. It would have a very detrimental effect. We must not allow a subsidy race between the Member States, so there is clearly a need for less aid, and aid that is better targeted.\nOn the specific concerns raised here today, the Commission will do its utmost to improve how the rules work in practice. It will also step up transparency, rightly called for by a number of Members. Aid should be monitored, but in the end it is only through a positive partnership that we will be able to deliver successful State aid reform.\nA couple of Members touched upon the role of the regional aid guidelines and focusing aid on the regions most in need. We discussed this before and it was adopted last year. Again that is not dogmatic, but it takes account of the fact that some need more backing at a particular moment. We want to deliver a fair and balanced package and we discussed that here in December.\nWe will look further at how the State aid rules can be adapted to new financing mechanisms such as public-private partnerships. The same goes for aid for projects of common interest to boost competitiveness and technological innovation. The question of innovation has been raised. I have just read an article by Professor Getz, saying that innovation should not just be developed in the research and development department of a company, it should be at all levels, from bottom to top. That is an interesting philosophy that could be considered when we are talking about how to boost innovation.\nTurning to SMEs, when we look at the 25 Member States, 92% of all the enterprises in the European Union are in the category of small and medium-sized enterprises. So when we talk about creating jobs and economic growth, we have to bear in mind that the vast majority fall within the category of small and medium-sized enterprises. That is what we are trying to take into account when we talk about giving them more attention than they have received up to now and to stimulate innovation and cooperation between, sometimes, a combination of research institutes, smaller companies and larger companies. It is a challenge to ensure that all those SMEs can take advantage of these opportunities.\nIt has rightly been mentioned that risk capital is not very developed in Europe. Compared to the United States, quite often innovative ideas are not taken up by companies that are small or just starting up because there is no backing from the banks. State aid to back those companies in their early development could be very helpful.\nMr Wortmann-Kool asked whether the Commission could raise the threshold. I am not saying that we would not be prepared to raise it. However, we should bear in mind that we are talking about SMEs and not large companies, and we should try to reduce bureaucracy and red tape. The amount of euros we are talking about really covers that category. So we shall be submitting a proposal quite soon, but do not be too optimistic, because I have heard on the grapevine that people are thinking of huge sums of money, but then we are not taking account of the category.\nOn the environment, the Commission cannot refuse to approve aid just because the objective pursued is not environmental. I am sure that is not the question that is being asked. We have to look at all the policies of the Union. However, the Commission shares the aim of reducing environmentally damaging State aid and we should all encourage Member States to take that into account when deciding on the subsidy.\nOn public services, services of general economic interest, the Commission\u2019s decision and framework makes clear how the State aid rules apply to public service compensation. The Commission is committed to reporting on the impact of those rules within the deadlines set by those instruments. As you know, the Commission does not consider a framework directive necessary. I am talking about less bureaucracy. I am being consistent and not saying that we should still do it when it is not necessary.\nFinally, the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs have done a great deal of work on this report and I am grateful that we can have a discussion with the same goal, i.e. more jobs for Europe, in a social context that we are proud to be living in.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Neelie Kroes, Member of the Commission .

I have just read an article by Professor Getz, saying that innovation should not just be developed in the research and development department of a company, it should be at all levels, from bottom to top. That is an interesting philosophy that could be considered when we are talking about how to boost innovation.\nTurning to SMEs, when we look at the 25 Member States, 92% of all the enterprises in the European Union are in the category of small and medium-sized enterprises. So when we talk about creating jobs and economic growth, we have to bear in mind that the vast majority fall within the category of small and medium-sized enterprises. That is what we are trying to take into account when we talk about giving them more attention than they have received up to now and to stimulate innovation and cooperation between, sometimes, a combination of research institutes, smaller companies and larger companies. It is a challenge to ensure that all those SMEs can take advantage of these opportunities.\nIt has rightly been mentioned that risk capital is not very developed in Europe. Compared to the United States, quite often innovative ideas are not taken up by companies that are small or just starting up because there is no backing from the banks. State aid to back those companies in their early development could be very helpful.\nMr Wortmann-Kool asked whether the Commission could raise the threshold. I am not saying that we would not be prepared to raise it. However, we should bear in mind that we are talking about SMEs and not large companies, and we should try to reduce bureaucracy and red tape. The amount of euros we are talking about really covers that category. So we shall be submitting a proposal quite soon, but do not be too optimistic, because I have heard on the grapevine that people are thinking of huge sums of money, but then we are not taking account of the category.\nOn the environment, the Commission cannot refuse to approve aid just because the objective pursued is not environmental. I am sure that is not the question that is being asked. We have to look at all the policies of the Union. However, the Commission shares the aim of reducing environmentally damaging State aid and we should all encourage Member States to take that into account when deciding on the subsidy.\nOn public services, services of general economic interest, the Commission\u2019s decision and framework makes clear how the State aid rules apply to public service compensation. The Commission is committed to reporting on the impact of those rules within the deadlines set by those instruments. As you know, the Commission does not consider a framework directive necessary. I am talking about less bureaucracy. I am being consistent and not saying that we should still do it when it is not necessary.\nFinally, the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs have done a great deal of work on this report and I am grateful that we can have a discussion with the same goal, i.e. more jobs for Europe, in a social context that we are proud to be living in.", "agenda_item": "State aid reform (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060213-ITEM-012", "intervention_id": "1-139", "summary_english": "{\n\"headline\": \"Commission Emphasizes Targeted, Transparent, and Wise State Aid Reform for Growth, Innovation, and Social Cohesion\",\n\"issueSum\": \"The key issues addressed include the need for reforming State aid to ensure it is less in quantity but better in quality, to stimulate growth, innovation, and employment while maintaining social and regional cohesion.

The user provided a detailed debate summary about State Aid Reform and wants the main points from Neelie Kroes. First, I need to find all the mentions of Neelie Kroes in the summary.\n\nLooking through the sections, there's a part under \"1. Competition, Innovation, and Market Efficiency\" where Neelie Kroes is mentioned. The quote says she supported \"less and better\" state aid, emphasizing \"legal certainty\" and warning against a \"subsidy race between Member States.\" She also mentions that state aid is taxpayers' money and needs to be explainable.\n\nAnother mention is in the \"Simplification, Legal Certainty, and Transparency\" section. Wait, no, that's under other speakers. Let me check again. The user's example response includes issueSum, positionSum, argSum, propSum. \n\nSo, for Neelie Kroes, the key points are her stance on \"less and better\" state aid, legal certainty, avoiding subsidy races, and transparency. Her position is in favor of reducing distortive aid and making it more targeted. The arguments are about legal certainty and preventing misuse. Proposals include \"less and better\" aid and ensuring transparency. \n\nI need to make sure I don't include other speakers' points. The user specified to only include what's attributed to Neelie Kroes. So the issueSum would be about balancing competition and transparency. PositionSum is supporting \"less and better\" aid. ArgSum is about legal certainty and preventing subsidy races. PropSum would be her proposals for targeted aid and transparency. \n\nWait, the example response has \"issueSum\" as the key issue. So for Kroes, the issues are competition law, transparency, and legal certainty. Her position is advocating for \"less and better\" state aid. The arguments are the need for legal certainty and explaining taxpayer money. Proposals include targeted aid and transparency measures. \n\nI need to structure this into the JSON fields without any markdown. Make sure each section is a summary of her points. Check that there's no mention of other speakers. The user said if there are no points, return an empty string, but here there are quotes.

Let me check the debate summary again.\n\nLooking through the summary, the main speakers mentioned are various MEPs and Commissioners like Gunnar H\u00f6kmark, Neelie Kroes, Sophia in 't Veld, etc. However, there's no specific mention of a \"President\" in the contributions.
