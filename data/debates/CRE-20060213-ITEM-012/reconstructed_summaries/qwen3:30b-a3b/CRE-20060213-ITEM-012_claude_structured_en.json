As we say over and over again, we need new businesses, new jobs, new products and new markets. It is, therefore, also important to follow these matters up by ensuring that new, small companies operate under basic conditions as good as those under which old, large companies operate. Experience of various kinds teaches us that State aid always tends to safeguard old, existing companies at the expense of new and growing companies.\nIf we look around at the European economy, as well as at the international economy, we see very clearly that the new companies and the new products have emerged not through State aid but through the existence of sound basic conditions for businesses and individual entrepreneurs. Each type of State aid that distorts competition always tends to distort it at the expense of what is new and growing and to the advantage of what is old. This is therefore an issue that, to the highest degree, is about how we are to obtain new jobs and new businesses. A policy of State aid whereby we preserve businesses that are not very competitive, together with old products and low wages, will contribute to Europe lagging behind. However, a policy that aims for less State aid and at removing such State aid as distorts competition and that, moreover, invests resources in innovation and research will be able to produce a different outcome.\nIn European history, we have a lot to learn from a whole range of different experiences where State aid is concerned. In my report, I write that the Commission needs carefully to monitor and analyse these experiences, as well as the good experiences there are, because the objective of State aid is often popular and generally approved of. The problem is simply that the results of it are rarely what one had imagined they would be. As a consequence, we end up with old structures and with a dependency on subsidies, and we do not produce new jobs. We have seen this within the shipbuilding and steel industries and within a great many other sectors. Where State aid is introduced, renewal and transformation go out of the window. We must ensure that the opposite situation comes about.\nAn overarching objective of the report is to follow up the general aim not only of reducing State aid but also, as stated clearly in the report and still more clearly in the Commission\u2019s document, of removing such State aid as distorts competition. A further objective is to ensure that those rules that exist are made clearer, for the aim must be to follow up the demand for less State aid. What is required is that State aid be predictable. It must not be possible for it to be used for relocations. The rules governing State aid must be generally applicable. The aid must not have a specific focus, but be directed across the board and not favour one company at the expense of another. That is extremely important when we debate innovation, for innovation policy must not be an excuse for increased State aid but be designed to create better basic conditions for innovation. The same applies to companies in the public interest. We must not have State aid that funds that type of activity excessively, but must give new companies opportunities to develop.\nThe same may be said of regional or environmental aid.

The task is to extract the main points he made, without including others. The example response structure is given, so I need to make sure I follow that.\n\nLooking at the key positions section, under \"Strong Reform Advocates,\" it says that Gunnar H\u00f6kmark (PPE-DE) led the reform charge, arguing that state aid \"safeguard old, existing companies at the expense of new and growing companies.\" He advocated for clearer rules, increased transparency, and redirecting resources toward innovation instead of preserving uncompetitive businesses.\n\nSo, the issue here is about state aid reform, specifically the need to shift focus from supporting existing companies to innovation. His position is in favor of reform, emphasizing less and better-targeted aid. The arguments he used are that current state aid favors old companies over new ones, and that clarity and transparency are needed. The proposals would include redirecting resources to innovation and making rules clearer.\n\nI need to structure this into the four fields: issueSum, positionSum, argSum, propSum. Let me check if there's anything else about him. The summary mentions he's the rapporteur, so he's a key figure here. No other points attributed to him beyond what's in the key positions. \n\nSo, issueSum would be the need for reform in state aid to focus on innovation. PositionSum is supporting the reform with clearer rules and transparency. ArgSum is that state aid currently favors old companies. PropSum is redirecting resources to innovation and clearer rules. \n\nI need to make sure not to include other speakers' points. For example, Sophia in 't Veld's points are separate.

I would like to take this opportunity to raise the issue of regional bonuses. It seems to me that in striving to attain the Lisbon Agenda parameters it would be logical to invest more in regions that are lagging behind, otherwise we risk creating only advanced, competitive enclaves that will inevitably be held back by the depressed areas, thus preventing the all-round growth of the European Union.\nIn addition, I\u00a0would like to emphasise the need to simplify procedures and to make the whole system of State aid provision transparent. Maximum transparency should be applied rigorously to the process of allocating and approving State aid. All persons and entities applying for aid in support of their activities must feel sure, in the event that they are turned down, that it was for objective reasons. Similarly, they must be informed about who has been granted aid, and why. This will generate a spirit of trust, and will enable citizens to have faith that the EU system is functioning in a uniform way.\nNational governments are important elements that can either support or disrupt this system. If they are given more responsibility for taking decisions on State aid provision, their decisions and activities must be subject to the transparency of the entire system. I\u00a0hope, Mr President, that we will all be able to conclude, following the reform of State aid provision, that the system really has been improved, and that it will contribute in a clearly objective manner to the uniform development of the European Union.", "lang": "SK", "original": "Milo\u0161 Koterec (PSE), Spravodajca V\u00fdboru pre region\u00e1lny rozvoj po\u017eiadan\u00e9ho o stanovisko . \u2013 Dovo\u013ete, aby som ako \u010dlen V\u00fdboru pre region\u00e1lny rozvoj a spravodajca pre ned\u00e1vno prijat\u00fa spr\u00e1vu o \u0161t\u00e1tnej pomoci pri region\u00e1lnom rozvoji povedal p\u00e1r slov z poh\u013eadu mo\u017en\u00fdch vplyvov reformy \u0161t\u00e1tnej pomoci na hospod\u00e1rsku, soci\u00e1lnu a teritori\u00e1lnu koh\u00e9ziu.\nAko Komisia vo svojom dokumente spr\u00e1vne kon\u0161tatuje, poskytovanie \u0161t\u00e1tnej pomoci je d\u00f4le\u017eit\u00fdm faktorom zabezpe\u010denia rovnomern\u00e9ho region\u00e1lneho rozvoja, a tak podporou jedn\u00e9ho zo z\u00e1kladn\u00fdch ekonomick\u00fdch pilierov Eur\u00f3pskej \u00fanie.

We are in fact dealing here with a non-legislative report, and I believe that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has done a good job in terms of voicing the European Parliament\u2019s strong position. On the whole, we have managed to end up with a fairly clear outlook on things.\nI am one of those who believe, along with the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, that we do in fact need to review the State aid system. This system is more than ever at the heart of the Commission\u2019s powers, since Europe remains essentially a Europe of the internal market and competition until further notice. I am not sure whether the \u2018No\u2019 vote in the French referendum offers other prospects for the long-term future. We are therefore truly at the heart of Community powers here, and it is true that, with the enlargement of Europe, the European Union and the Commission are at risk of thrombosis if the State aid system and arrangements are left in their current state.\nParliament has above all stressed that the internal market and competition should not be regarded as representing every aspect of European society. We are not just a market society; there must, as the texts stipulate, also be room for public action, not only on all those occasions when the market is failing, but also on all those occasions when we need to reduce social or territorial inequalities, manage external effects, promote innovation and, should the need arise, give a boost to industry. When, at times, we shift to a free market way of thinking, we sometimes find ourselves wondering: \u2018Would we be in a position today to build the Airbus or would we be in a position to build the Ariane rocket, given the dominant ideology?\u2019 I believe that we must retain this opportunity to intervene very forcefully in the industrial landscape and in public research.\nI should like to say to the Commissioner that the main contribution of Parliament is to ensure that State aid is not assessed as something merely to be borne but, rather, is assessed in a balanced way, that is to say that not only are the negative aspects, such as distortions of competition, considered, but so too are the positive effects. We, in the European Parliament, wanted the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality to be clearly applied and, more specifically, wanted State aid that has no obvious impact on the internal market to be considered as compensation. We also wanted market failures to be better understood.\nFinally, I should like to mention the issues that still need to be discussed and that are referred to in the 21 amendments tabled. With regard to public services, we need clarification on those aspects to do with compensation, with the legitimate funding of public services and with subsidiary funding and, above all, we need clarification on what constitutes the fourth criterion set out in the Altmark judgment, a criterion that, by the Commission\u2019s own admission, is actually extremely vague and very difficult to handle.\nWith regard to innovation, Mrs\u00a0in 't Veld will soon present us with her report. We believe that it is a very good text and we hope to enhance it. The question that must be asked concerns the scope of the report: should it be strictly confined to innovation, or should it branch out a little further into the area of research and development? With regard to the regions, some excellent amendments are focused on preventing relocations from being funded by State aid. This is an extremely serious problem because it gives Europeans the impression that they are being pitted against one another, and this in terms, furthermore, of the amount received by way of public subsidies.\nFinally, I should like to conclude by saying that we are obviously totally in favour of State aid being considered in the framework of the Lisbon Process and the Gothenburg Process, that is to say not only in terms of the knowledge-based economy, but also in terms of helping the environment.", "lang": "FR", "original": "Gilles Savary, au nom du groupe PSE . - Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, je voudrais remercier notre rapporteur M.

Nous ne sommes pas uniquement une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de march\u00e9; il faut aussi qu\u2019il y ait une place pour l\u2019action publique, toutes les fois o\u00f9 le march\u00e9 est d\u00e9faillant, comme le stipulent les textes, mais aussi toutes les fois o\u00f9 nous avons besoin de r\u00e9duire des in\u00e9galit\u00e9s sociales ou territoriales, de g\u00e9rer des effets externes, de promouvoir l\u2019innovation et, \u00e9ventuellement, de donner des impulsions industrielles. Il nous arrive parfois dans certains glissements lib\u00e9raux de nous dire: serions-nous capables aujourd\u2019hui de faire Airbus o\u00f9 serions-nous capables de faire Ariane, compte tenu de l\u2019id\u00e9ologie dominante? Je crois qu\u2019il faut se garder cette possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019intervenir tr\u00e8s fortement dans le paysage industriel et la recherche publique.\nJe voudrais dire \u00e0 l\u2019attention de Mme la Commissaire que les apports essentiels du Parlement sont, d\u2019une part, que l\u2019\u00e9valuation des aides d\u2019\u00c9tat ne se fasse pas seulement \u00e0 charge, mais qu\u2019elle soit \u00e9quilibr\u00e9e, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire que l\u2019on regarde les aspects n\u00e9gatifs - distorsions de la concurrence - mais aussi les effets positifs. Nous avons souhait\u00e9 au Parlement europ\u00e9en que les principes de subsidiarit\u00e9 et de proportionnalit\u00e9 soient clairement appliqu\u00e9s et en particulier que les aides d\u2019\u00c9tat qui n\u2019ont pas d\u2019impact manifeste sur le march\u00e9 int\u00e9rieur soient consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme des compensations. Nous avons souhait\u00e9 \u00e9galement que les d\u00e9faillances du march\u00e9 soient mieux appr\u00e9hend\u00e9es.\nEnfin, je voudrais \u00e9voquer les d\u00e9bats qui restent pendants et qu\u2019on retrouve dans les vingt et un amendements qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s. Concernant les services publics, nous avons besoin d\u2019une clarification sur l\u2019aspect des compensations, sur l\u2019aspect du financement l\u00e9gitime des services publics, sur l\u2019aspect du financement subsidiaire et surtout sur ce qu\u2019est le quatri\u00e8me crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Altmark, qui est effectivement extr\u00eamement flou et tr\u00e8s difficile \u00e0 manier de l\u2019aveu m\u00eame de la Commission.\nConcernant l\u2019innovation, Mme in \u2018t Veld nous pr\u00e9sentera bient\u00f4t son rapport. Nous pensons qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un tr\u00e8s bon texte et nous esp\u00e9rons l\u2019enrichir. La question qui se pose est celle du champ d\u2019application: faut-il s\u2019en tenir strictement \u00e0 l\u2019innovation, ou faut-il aller un peu plus loin dans le domaine de la recherche et du d\u00e9veloppement? Concernant les r\u00e9gions, d\u2019excellents amendements portent sur le fait d\u2019\u00e9viter de financer des d\u00e9localisations par des aides d\u2019\u00c9tat.

State support should be a last resort and is not a panacea. Although it may be presented in that way from time to time, it also has adverse side effects.\nAt the same time, we can be open-handed in granting state support only after all pre-conditions and our other items of policy have been complied with, or else we would end up fighting a running battle. We must, for example, ensure that the internal market is completed and functions well and in that respect, I hope that this House will be taking a sensible decision on Thursday with regard to the services directive.\nWe must counter protectionism, promote fair competition, abolish red tape and excessive legislation, guarantee better access to risk capital and also establish an internal market for financial services, but at the same time, we must put in place such things as truly free movement for workers from all EU Member States and an immigration policy that is geared towards keeping the brightest and best, our top people, in Europe rather than chasing them away to the United States.\nOnly when those things are in place can we see whether we might be able to intervene with State aid where the market is inefficient, for we are not so much dealing with market failure as we are with market inefficiencies.\nI should also like to repeat that State aid should, in principle, not be sanctioned. It disrupts the market and distorts competition. Mr Savary said a moment ago that the EU has a tendency to be too liberal, but I should like to draw Mr Savary\u2019s attention to the fact that we spend billions on State aid each year. Even by the most conservative estimates, the amounts involved are more or less half of the EU\u2019s budget, so that is not terribly liberal in my view. Things could be a bit more liberal as far as I am concerned.\nI also agree with what Mr Savary said a moment ago: we must set aside State aid for the priorities of the twenty-first century: the Lisbon objectives, innovation, knowledge, sustainability \u2026\nConsequently, I think that we should give far less State aid to obsolete and obsolescent industries, and as far as State aid for environmental objectives is concerned, I think we should first set to abolishing the billions of State aid we grant the many polluting industries and sectors that make use of sources of non-renewable energy, and I will therefore advise my group to support Mr Lipietz\u2019s amendments to that effect.\nGlobal context is also important in the debate. We cannot deny, of course, that in other parts of the world, liberal amounts of State aid are still being given out. That much we should recognise, but our objective to reduce State aid remains intact.\nFinally, I should like to say a few words on public services. I should like to repeat \u2013 and I am increasingly feeling like a voice in the wilderness in this respect \u2013 that the phrases \u2018services of general interest\u2019 and \u2018services of general economic interest\u2019 have still not been defined, and it is, in that light, very odd to legislate for them. That is just by the by.\nAs Mr Savary mentioned a moment ago, legal certainty and clarity are urgently needed for those public services.\nI should like to finish by asking the Commission to submit, at the earliest opportunity, an assessment of the impact which the rules that the Commission adopted last year had on State aid as compensation for public services. I would like to know the amount of State aid involved, the number of companies involved and what impact this had on the market.", "lang": "NL", "original": "Sophia in \u2019t Veld, namens de ALDE-Fractie . \u2013 Voorzitter, allereerst wil ik mijn steun betuigen aan het uitstekende rapport van de heer H\u00f6kmark, waar wij ons als fractie achter zullen stellen, en we steunen ook de keuze die de Commissie heeft gemaakt, nl. minder en betere staatssteun, waarbij ik nog een keer zou willen onderstrepen dat het dus \u00f3\u00f3k gaat om minder, laten we dat niet vergeten. Staatssteun moet een laatste redmiddel zijn en het is geen wondermiddel. Het wordt wel eens een keer zo gepresenteerd, maar staatssteun heeft ook negatieve bijwerkingen.\nDaarnaast kunnen we niet ruimhartig staatssteun geven, als alle randvoorwaarden en ons ander beleid niet in orde zijn. Dat is namelijk dweilen met de kraan open. We moeten er bijvoorbeeld voor zorgen dat de interne markt vervolmaakt wordt en goed functioneert en wat dat betreft, hoop ik dus ook dat dit Parlement op donderdag een verstandige keuze ten aanzien van de dienstenrichtlijn zal maken.\nWe moeten protectionisme tegengaan, we moeten eerlijke concurrentie stimuleren, bureaucratie en overregulering afschaffen, zorgen voor betere toegang tot risicokapitaal en ook een interne markt tot stand brengen voor financi\u00eble diensten, maar tegelijk moeten we zorgen voor zaken als bijvoorbeeld een echt vrij verkeer voor werknemers uit alle EU-lidstaten en een immigratiebeleid dat erop gericht is om de \u201cbest en brightest\u201d, onze beste krachten, binnen te halen in Europa in plaats van ze weg te jagen naar de Verenigde Staten.\nPas als we al die dingen op orde hebben, kunnen we gaan kijken of we eventueel, waar de markt ineffici\u00ebnt is, want het gaat niet om marktfalen, maar om marktineffici\u00ebnties, kunnen bijspringen met staatssteun.\nStaatssteun mag in principe niet, laten we dat ook nog eens een keer herhalen. Staatssteun verstoort de markt en vervalst concurrentie. De heer Savary zei net dat de EU er wel eens naar neigt te liberaal te zijn, maar ik wil onder de aandacht van de heer Savary brengen dat we elk jaar miljarden aan staatssteun spenderen. Zelfs in de meest conservatieve schattingen gaat het om bedragen ter hoogte van ongeveer de helft van het budget van de Europese Unie, dus dat vind ik niet zo heel erg liberaal. Wat mij betreft mag het wel iets liberaler.\nIk ben het eens met wat de heer Savary ook net gezegd heeft: we moeten staatssteun geven voor de prioriteiten van de 21ste eeuw: de doelstellingen van Lissabon, innovatie, kennis, duurzaamheid ...\nBijgevolg moeten we volgens mij veel minder staatssteun geven aan oude en ten dode opgeschreven industrie\u00ebn en wat staatssteun voor milieudoelstellingen betreft, denk ik dat we eerst eens moeten gaan kijken naar het afschaffen van de miljarden staatssteun die we geven aan hele vervuilende industrie\u00ebn en sectoren die gebruik maken van niet hernieuwbare energiebronnen en ik zal dan ook mijn fractie aanraden om de amendementen te steunen van de heer Lipietz die in die richting gaan.\nVerder is in het debat ook de mondiale context van belang. Natuurlijk is het zo dat we niet kunnen ontkennen dat in andere delen van de wereld nog steeds ruimhartig staatssteun gegeven wordt, dat moeten we erkennen, maar onze doelstelling moet terugdringing van de staatssteun blijven.\nDan tenslotte even over publieke diensten. Ik wil hier nog maar eens zeggen, zo langzamerhand voel ik me een roepende in de woestijn, dat de termen diensten van algemeen belang en diensten van algemeen economisch belang nog steeds niet gedefinieerd zijn en dat het dus heel raar is om daar wetgeving over te maken. Maar goed.\nVoor die publieke diensten is dringend juridische zekerheid en helderheid nodig. Het is net ook al door de heer Savary aangegeven.\nIk zou willen afsluiten, mijnheer de Voorzitter, met een verzoek aan de Commissie, nl. om zo snel mogelijk een evaluatie voor te leggen van de impact van de regels die de Commissie vorig jaar heeft aangenomen met betrekking tot staatssteun als compensatie voor publieke diensten.

It is true to say that Europe is competitive only if it is also innovative in the ways in which it protects the environment. I think it would be a good thing if there were a bonus not only for innovation, but also, and primarily, for environmental information, and I think it regrettable that this is absent from the Commissioner\u2019s draft.\nSecondly, one important feature of the report is the fact that the de minimis rules really must be applied to businesses with at least EUR\u00a0200 000 per annum. I have to say, Commissioner, that they are very generalised, and that is not enough. We know that these businesses are needed in rural areas if they are to enjoy the most basic economic development, just as we know that the regions affected by population change need businesses to settle in them, and if they are to do that they will need State aid. There is no other way in which we can counteract such effects, and so I think it is important that there should be a marked increase in this area.\nFinally, let me turn to the rules for businesses providing services of general interest. It is not acceptable that such rules should qualify the Altmark ruling, for the risk then arises of the Commission using competition rules as a means of defining what general interest actually means \u2013 the very same thing that you are trying to do by means of the services directive, that controversial document in which you sacrifice general interest on the altar of the free market.\nWhat we need, then \u2013 and urgently, too \u2013 is a framework directive, even if you do not see yourself as having that responsibility, and we need one in this instance because we want the social Europe to stand on secure foundations, one of the most fundamental of which is services of general interest, and the public will turn their backs on Europe if these become the victim of rules on competition.", "lang": "DE", "original": "Elisabeth Schroedter, im Namen der Verts/ALE-Fraktion . \u2013 Herr Pr\u00e4sident! Ich kann unmittelbar an meine Vorrednerin ankn\u00fcpfen. Es ist richtig, dass Europa an sich nur wettbewerbsf\u00e4hig ist, wenn es auch im Bereich Umweltschutz innovativ ist. Ich f\u00e4nde es gut, wenn es nicht nur f\u00fcr die Innovation, sondern vor allen Dingen f\u00fcr die Umweltinformation einen Bonus g\u00e4be. Das vermisse ich in Ihrem Entwurf, Frau Kommissarin.\nZum Zweiten hat der Bericht eine wichtige Passage, n\u00e4mlich die Tatsache, dass die De-Minimis-Regeln \u2013 200\u00a0000\u00a0Euro j\u00e4hrlich \u2013 f\u00fcr solche Betriebe auch wirklich gelten m\u00fcssen. Sie sind sehr allgemein, Frau Kommissarin \u2013 das reicht nicht aus. Wir wissen, dass wir gerade im l\u00e4ndlichen Raum diese Betriebe brauchen, um dort eine Grundversorgung an wirtschaftlicher Entwicklung zu haben. Wir wissen, dass genau die Regionen, die vom demographischen Effekt betroffen sind, Betriebe brauchen, die sich dort ansiedeln, und dazu brauchen wir staatliche Unterst\u00fctzung. Anders k\u00f6nnen wir solchen Effekten nicht entgegenwirken. Ich finde es deswegen wichtig, dass hier eine deutliche Erh\u00f6hung stattfindet.\nZum Schluss komme ich zu den Regeln f\u00fcr Unternehmen f\u00fcr Dienstleistungen des allgemeinen wirtschaftlichen Interesses. Es darf nicht sein, dass diese Regeln das Altmark-Urteil einschr\u00e4nken, denn dann besteht die Gefahr, dass die Kommission \u00fcber die Wettbewerbsregeln definiert, was Daseinsvorsorge ist. Das ist genau der gleiche Versuch, den Sie in der Dienstleistungsrichtlinie machen, wo Sie in Ihrem umstrittenen Text die Daseinsvorsorge dem freien Markt opfern.\nDeshalb sage ich: Wir brauchen dringend eine Rahmenregelung, auch wenn Sie sich daf\u00fcr nicht verantwortlich f\u00fchlen. Wir brauchen sie in diesem Fall, denn wir wollen, dass ein soziales Europa gefestigt wird.

Also, in the common themes and proposals, she proposed increasing de minimis thresholds to EUR 200,000 per annum.\n\nSo, the issue she raised is about linking innovation and environmental protection. Her position is that state aid should focus on environmental bonuses. The argument is that Europe's competitiveness requires innovation in environmental protection. The proposal is increasing the de minimis thresholds for SMEs.\n\nI need to make sure I don't include other speakers' points.

This means less State aid for grass-roots needs and servicing of the competitiveness of European capital. In other words, the people's money will be not for grass-roots prosperity, but for the profitability of capital.\nThe references to State aid for purposes of general interest and in the public good at European Union level not only demonstrate indifference to the asymmetrical development between the Member States, but also prejudge that such a procedure will further strengthen this asymmetrical development by increasing inequality and injustice.\nIt is vital, they say, to reduce State aid, in order for it to have positive results. Do remote rural and island areas, such as those in my country, in which capital does not invest because there is no or little profit, really have to be abandoned completely, including by State aid, and be laid to waste? They are already being abandoned, to a degree, and it looks like this will intensify in future.\nPublic services are being privatised, basic grass-roots needs are being commercialised. The reduction in State aid and its orientation towards servicing the anti-grass roots Lisbon Strategy will exacerbate still further the situation of the grass-roots classes. Despite the reference to the financing of small- and medium-sized enterprises for investments, unfortunately the evidence shows that, so far, economic aid for small businesses has been non-existent or has been dispensed with a dropper.

There's no mention of specific proposals or other arguments from her. \n\nThe issue she raises is about the focus of the reforms. Her position is skeptical, arguing that the reforms benefit large corporations instead of addressing the needs of smaller entities or grassroots levels. The argument here is that the reforms are not genuinely helping the intended sectors but are instead favoring big businesses. There's no explicit proposal from her, just criticism.\n\nSo, structuring the JSON: issueSum would be about the focus of state aid reforms on big business. positionSum is her stance against the reforms, saying they serve big business. argSum is her argument that the reforms don't address grassroots needs. propSum would be empty since there's no proposal mentioned.\n\nI need to make sure not to include anything from other speakers. The example response uses summaries, so I need to keep it concise. Also, check if there's any other info about her in other sections. The executive summary and common themes don't mention her again.

The summary says he opposed the reforms, saying they serve big business. So his position is against the reforms, arguing they harm the economy. His arguments are based on historical examples.

The Commissioner\u2019s contribution also gave great cause for hope.\nThe reform of policy on State aid is enormously important to people at the local level, where the towns, boroughs and regions are the main sources of public investments. As has already been said, their municipal enterprises play an important part in guaranteeing the provision of services of general interest, and so it is important that the Commission should \u2013 as it has already agreed to do \u2013 announce how it proposes to implement the criteria set out in the ECJ\u2019s ruling in the Altmark case. If legal disputes are to be avoided, those who will have to apply these criteria must have a clear idea of what the Commission\u2019s policy is. The more concrete the Altmark criteria are, the more difficult they are to implement, and the individual public offices cannot be expected to get to grips with the fundamental principle and determine for themselves whether or not aid has been granted on the basis of the avoidance of overcompensation using market compensations; to do so would involve them in a quite unjustifiable amount of bureaucracy. The local offices could, though, be enabled to do that if \u2013 as has indeed already been announced \u2013 they had access to workable guidelines with which, for example, they could determine which market was relevant.

Die Anwender m\u00fcssen Klarheit \u00fcber die Politik der Kommission haben, um Rechtsstreite zu vermeiden. Die Kriterien des Altmark-Urteils sind umso schwieriger anzuwenden, je konkreter sie sind.

I think that it is once again thanks to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs that we have managed, with a very liberal Swedish perspective and at the same time a Socialist French perspective, to achieve a good outcome after all.\nIn contrast to my Dutch fellow Member, Mrs in \u2019t Veld, I will not make a case for less State aid. In my view, this \u2018less is more\u2019 mind-set is not the most important dimension. What matters is for what purpose and how this State aid is deployed. State aid should not only be seen as a deviation or aberration from perfect market forces, but as an instrument for achieving socio-economic objectives.\nIt is to be welcomed that the current Commissioner for Competition also sees her portfolio in such a broader economic context, to include the Lisbon strategy, for this strategy is not just about economic, but also about broader socio-economic effects. This socio-economic context and this additional perspective of employment and social cohesion are also the very aspects I should like to stress on behalf of my group.\nI should, in this context, like to mention two points in respect of which I would ask you not to be too dogmatic in your approach.\nFirst of all, with regard to market failure, it is important to look at the bigger picture in that area too, and to take full account of employment and social cohesion. The other point is the temporary nature of State aid. Here too, I would ask you to allow for some degree of flexibility, because some sectors might well need government subsidies and government instruments in the longer term \u2013 national radio and television spring to mind. The importance of plurality of the press and a good balance in the provision of information may require longer-term investments of government funds into sectors of that kind.\nPublic housing is another example. Given the interests of town and country planning, the integration of minorities and social integration in cities, certain players within the market may well be granted government support in order to achieve those broader objectives.\nFinally, with regard to the European and national dimensions, I should like to point out, as indeed Mr\u00a0H\u00f6kmark did in his report, that State aid can be used from time to time to stir up policy competition between Member States, and I should like to ask the Commission to keep an eye on this and to monitor this more closely, and to check whether it is the Member States themselves and not just the companies that are granted State aid that have to have sanctions imposed on them.", "lang": "NL", "original": "Ieke van den Burg (PSE). \u2013 Voorzitter, ook ik zou mij willen voegen bij degenen die de rapporteur, maar ook de schaduwrapporteurs feliciteren met het behaalde resultaat.

Ik denk dat dit minder-meer niet de belangrijkste dimensie is. Het gaat erom met welk doel en hoe die staatssteun wordt ingezet. Staatssteun moet niet alleen gezien worden als een afwijking, een aberratie ten opzichte van perfecte marktwerking, maar als een instrument voor sociale, economische en maatschappelijke doelen.\nHet is positief dat deze Commissaris van mededinging haar portefeuille ook in zo\u2019n bredere economische context ziet, nl. de Lissabon-strategie, en in die Lissabon-strategie gaat het inderdaad niet alleen over economische, maar ook over bredere sociaal-economische effecten. Dus vanuit mijn fractie zou ik met name ook dat willen benadrukken, die sociaal economische context en die bijkomende invalshoek van werkgelegenheid en sociale cohesie.\nIn dit verband zou ik twee punten willen noemen en willen vragen om op die punten geen te dogmatische benadering te kiezen.\nIn de eerste plaats het marktfalen. Daar gaat het er ook om naar bredere aspecten te kijken en volop rekening met werkgelegenheid en sociale cohesie te houden. Het andere punt is het tijdelijke karakter van de staatssteun. Ook daar zou ik ervoor willen pleiten er niet te dogmatisch mee om te gaan, want het kan zijn dat het in sommige sectoren wel degelijk nodig is om ook voor wat langere termijn met overheidssubsidies en overheidsinstrumenten te werken. Ik noem bijvoorbeeld de publieke omroep: het belang van pluraliteit van de pers en een goed evenwicht in de informatievoorziening kan vereisen dat er ook op langere termijn overheidsgeld in zo\u2019n sector gestoken wordt.\nVolkshuisvesting is een ander voorbeeld. Daar kan het ook zijn dat de belangen van stedenbouwkundige planning, het integreren van minderheden en sociale integratie in een stad vereisen dat je bepaalde spelers op de markt voorziet van overheidssteun om die ruimere doelstellingen te kunnen halen.\nDe laatste opmerking gaat over de Europese dimensie en de nationale dimensie. Daar zou ik erop willen wijzen, en dat heeft de heer H\u00f6kmark in het verslag ook gedaan, op het feit dat staatssteun nog wel eens gebruikt wordt om beleidsconcurrentie tussen lidstaten te voeren en ik zou de Commissie willen vragen daarop te letten, daar vanuit de Commissie sterker op toe te zien en ook op het gebied van sanctionering te kijken of de lidstaten zelf op dit punt niet aangepakt moeten worden en niet alleen de bedrijven waar de steun naartoe gaat.", "agenda_item": "State aid reform (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060213-ITEM-012", "intervention_id": "1-126", "summary_english": "{\n  \"headline\": \"Supports Flexible Approach to State Aid Reform with Focus on Socio-Economic Objectives Beyond Market Efficiency\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"The speaker addresses state aid reform, emphasizing the need to view state aid as an instrument for achieving socio-economic objectives rather than merely a market deviation.

If we take Gothenburg seriously, it makes sound business sense to rely on the equilateral triangle between economic, social and environmental development, but the statement is flawed in economic terms.\nIf Mr H\u00f6kmark \u2013 as he himself is right to say \u2013 wants small and medium-sized enterprises to be efficient and innovation to be driven forward, above all by subsidy, then what is needed alongside that is good training, good education, and the right infrastructure \u2013 not just in the great conurbations, but also, of course, in rural areas. He is therefore forced back onto the need for territorial, social and environmental cohesion.\nIf not, the simple fact is that people who live in places without these favourable and natural conditions are put at a disadvantage. That being so, I do indeed urge that a great deal of care be taken when considering where aid is to be applied, and it also has to be considered whether services in the public interest benefit from it, or else there is no point to it.\nIn one respect, I can tell Mr H\u00f6kmark that he is absolutely right. He writes that it makes no sense to give aid to businesses that are already profitable, and in that I agree with him.\nWhen I say that that sort of aid is wrong, I am thinking of the Federal Republic of Germany and of the highly-profitable motor industry into which money is shovelled, only for the firms to then close down and take production elsewhere with the help of more subsidies. That cannot be what aid is for. In that respect, Mr\u00a0H\u00f6kmark, you have got it absolutely right.\nThere are a whole load of models that we have to change. The de minimis threshold is the right one. It is indeed the case that regional aid is needed for the more backward regions in particular, and it cannot be denied that aid under Article 87 will continue to be needed for those regions currently affected by the statistical effect.", "lang": "DE", "original": "Helmuth Markov (GUE/NGL). \u2013 Herr Pr\u00e4sident, Frau Kommissarin, Herr Berichterstatter!

I agree that the administrative aspects of the procedure ought to be simplified, too. I strongly agree that we should increase the transparency of assistance. I also agree that a clearer regulation should be developed, especially in the area of public services. Transparency is also needed to make it clear who may be granted government assistance. Therefore the provision of assistance should be accompanied by the publication of a detailed list of those who are granted assistance, specifying the amounts received by each of them, especially in the case of agricultural allocations.\nHowever, I would like to call attention to the fact that while, on the one hand, I agree that there should not be any discrimination between regions or countries as regards assistance, on the other hand we must acknowledge that there are significantly underdeveloped countries and regions within the internal market. However, these countries \u2013 precisely in the interest of deepening the internal market \u2013 need a longer period of adaptation. It would not be fortunate if the debate on government assistance provided an opportunity for political attacks against the new Member States. These new Member States have already reduced their assistance significantly. These levels of assistance are not outstanding even when compared to their GDP, and they are lower than those of the more developed Member States in the most relevant comparison terms of euro/capita. This must also be taken into consideration when new Member States are accused in other areas, for instance of tax dumping. Also, it would not be fortunate if someone were to make a connection between government and European Union assistance and the delocation of companies, especially when new Member States are still in a negative transition period as regards structural funds or direct payments.\nApart from defined regional assistance, the aim is indeed to assist investments that create jobs in underdeveloped, competitively disadvantaged regions. We are not aiming at introducing an approach that would drive investors away from the European Union.

I too wish to join my colleagues in thanking Mr\u00a0H\u00f6kmark for all the excellent work he has done to enable this report to be finalised today. The subject of State aid is one on which there is definitely a lot of room for discussion. This is because it directly concerns all 25 Member States. It is good to ask where we want the reform to take us and to see what has led to the need for this kind of reform. When the preliminary decisions taken by the Commission between February 2004 and the present day are examined thoroughly and compared with the Lisbon Strategy and the conclusions of the 2002 Barcelona European Summit, it is evident that it would be much more productive if State aid were more direct and designed to meet these same objectives. Thus, I think that we should work towards having a system that is as simple as possible and, therefore, more effective and more transparent. This will be an indispensable instrument because it will eliminate unnecessary bureaucracy that, until now, has not only led to more money being wasted but has prevented State aid from bringing about progress and made it less suited to the purpose for which it was intended. We need better to protect the use of State aid so that funds are delivered to where they are needed and not, as previously used to happen, squandered to no good purpose. We have to reach a position where the State has clear aims, involving the proportionality principle, concerning where it wants to use its aid. We must not forget that these funds are subsidised by all taxpayers, so we want them to be used wisely and responsibly so that they are more productive and their effects still more keenly felt. We must not forget companies that have logistical problems as a result of being based in disadvantaged regions, for example companies on an island such as Gozo.

The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs will be closely monitoring the Commission in the next few months and we will gladly enter into dialogue with it, because I hope that the Commission will issue more detailed guidelines on the definition of State aid so as to guarantee more legal certainty and prevent misuse at the same time, because innovation should be what it implies, rather than a licence for certain Member States to carry on as before.\nI am also pleased that the majority in Parliament wants to go further than the Commissioner, by doubling the minimum threshold at which point State aid must be reported to Brussels.

As we heard, this House, in an own-initiative report a few weeks ago, spoke out in favour of State aid for disadvantaged regions being continued until 2013. As the support businesses get from State aid is among the factors that influence them when making decisions about investment in a given area, it has an essential contribution to make to economic growth and the creation of jobs in that area. The EC Treaty includes a fundamental prohibition of State aid where it has a detrimental effect on the internal market by potentially distorting competition, but an exception is made for certain types of State aid, such as that given to promote the economic development of Europe\u2019s disadvantaged regions. As a member of the Committee for Regional Development, I am firmly of the conviction that direct State aid has a key role to play in regional development and plays an important part in achieving our primary cohesion goals.\nThe scope given to aid by Article 87(3)(a) of the EC Treaty in conjunction with the guidelines for regional aid have, in the past, enabled the regions concerned to attract businesses and thereby actively contribute to their own regeneration. Were such support is no longer possible, these regions\u2019 convergence process would be jeopardised by the lack of any competitive advantage against not only regions without developmental disadvantages but also regions in the new Member States in receipt of the maximum amounts of aid.

Sadly, that was a one-sided and distorted outlook, which often meant that less of that rightful public support went to strategic economic sectors, such as research and innovation, or to the vital cohesion policy. In contrast, the Barroso Commission seems to take a different view, and the resolution approved by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs provides some guidelines from which the Commission ought not to deviate.\nNone of us opposes competition. Nevertheless, this basic value in the market economy has often been subject to the ideologies of bureaucrats and economists lacking in any political responsibility, to the extent that, in the real economy, they have been responsible for delaying the recovery of competitiveness in entire regions of the European Union.\nAs Mr\u00a0Pittella has already stated, we must start a new chapter today by reconciling competition with cohesion policies. To this end, advantageous tax conditions, for instance, are useful because they can contribute positively to the cohesion policies and because, in the absence of any tax harmonisation among the Member States, they constitute a vital instrument in the hands of national governments where tackling regional underdevelopment is concerned.\nI therefore want to make just one recommendation to Mrs\u00a0Kroes: that she drafts a new proposal for a directive as quickly as possible. This proposal should \u2013 if not exclusively, then mainly \u2013 take account of Parliament\u2019s guidelines, given that the crisis the Union is grappling with is completely subsumed by the Council\u2019s crisis and by its inability, for example, to deal with the unequal way in which the Member States\u2019 markets are deregulated, a situation that is far more damaging to competition than any misguided State aid is.", "lang": "IT", "original": "Paolo Cirino Pomicino (PPE-DE). \u2013 Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, signora Commissario, la proposta di risoluzione in esame \u00e8 un punto di saggio equilibrio \u2013 come saggio \u00e8 il nostro relatore \u2013 tra opinioni diverse e coglie un\u2019esigenza profonda dell\u2019Unione europea, da troppo tempo ferma al palo di una crescita bassa e poco competitiva.\nLa Commissione Prodi ha sempre guardato agli aiuti di Stato come a un nemico della concorrenza e del mercato unico. Si \u00e8 trattato di una visione purtroppo parziale e distorta, che spesso ha fatto venir meno quel legittimo sostegno pubblico a settori economici strategici, quali la ricerca e l\u2019innovazione nonch\u00e9 la necessaria politica di coesione. La Commissione Barroso sembra invece respirare un\u2019aria diversa e la risoluzione approvata dalla commissione per i problemi economici e monetari fornisce alcune linee guida dalle quali la Commissione non dovrebbe discostarsi.\nNessuno di noi \u00e8 un attentatore della concorrenza. Tuttavia, questo valore essenziale nell\u2019economia di mercato \u00e8 stato spesso ideologizzato da burocrati e da economisti privi di responsabilit\u00e0 politica, sino al punto da innescare nell\u2019economia reale colpevoli ritardi nel recupero di competitivit\u00e0 di intere regioni dell\u2019Unione europea.\nCome ha gi\u00e0 detto l\u2019onorevole Pittella, oggi si deve voltar pagina conciliando concorrenza e politiche di coesione. In questa direzione, ad esempio, \u00e8 utile la fiscalit\u00e0 di vantaggio che pu\u00f2 concorrere in maniera determinante alle politiche di coesione e che, in assenza di un\u2019armonizzazione fiscale tra gli Stati membri, costituisce uno strumento indispensabile nelle mani dei governi nazionali per combattere il sottosviluppo regionale.\nDesidero dunque rivolgere alla signora Kroes solamente la raccomandazione di redigere al pi\u00f9 presto una nuova proposta di direttiva tenendo presenti, se non esclusivamente almeno prevalentemente, gli orientamenti del Parlamento, visto che la crisi in cui l\u2019Unione si dibatte \u00e8 tutta racchiusa nella crisi del Consiglio e nella sua incapacit\u00e0, ad esempio, di superare le liberalizzazioni asimmetriche dei mercati degli Stati membri, che sono la tomba della concorrenza molto pi\u00f9 di quanto non lo sia qualche aiuto di Stato sbagliato.", "agenda_item": "State aid reform (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060213-ITEM-012", "intervention_id": "1-138", "summary_english": "```json\n{\n  \"headline\": \"State aid reform needed to balance competition with cohesion policy and support regional development\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"The speaker addresses the European Union's approach to state aid reform, criticizing the previous Prodi Commission's treatment of state aid as purely anti-competitive while highlighting the EU's problem of low and uncompetitive growth.

Mr President, I count my blessings tonight. I conclude that there is not that much difference between political views on this issue. I congratulate the rapporteur. The content of the report and the Commission review are in line with what we discussed during this debate.\nI should like to underline that there is no rigid dogma. That was made clear on your side. It is more that we try to give a hook to Member States\u2019 companies, because the aid does not go to the Member States themselves. Via State aid, the Member State gives a hook to those who need a bit of help, instead of just giving them the fish. They want to do it themselves, but they need a little bit of backing.\nMrs in\u2018t Veld and other Members have talked about less and better State aid. She mentioned that that statement by the Commission is appropriate advice, in the opinion of her political group and her personal opinion. I would have been pleased to say that it was my wording, but we got it from the Council. Aid should be less and better. That is what we tried to indicate and that is what the rapporteur put in his report. State aid reform has to be shaped to deliver not only on growth, innovation and employment, but also on a wide range of primarily non-economic issues. We all agree that they are of fundamental importance to our social European model. These include the social and regional cohesion, human capital and cultural diversity rightly mentioned by Mrs van den Burg. However, State aid should be used wisely, because it is taxpayers\u2019 money. We should not compete through State aid by the Member States, because that is the wrong route. It would have a very detrimental effect. We must not allow a subsidy race between the Member States, so there is clearly a need for less aid, and aid that is better targeted.\nOn the specific concerns raised here today, the Commission will do its utmost to improve how the rules work in practice. It will also step up transparency, rightly called for by a number of Members. Aid should be monitored, but in the end it is only through a positive partnership that we will be able to deliver successful State aid reform.\nA couple of Members touched upon the role of the regional aid guidelines and focusing aid on the regions most in need. We discussed this before and it was adopted last year. Again that is not dogmatic, but it takes account of the fact that some need more backing at a particular moment. We want to deliver a fair and balanced package and we discussed that here in December.\nWe will look further at how the State aid rules can be adapted to new financing mechanisms such as public-private partnerships. The same goes for aid for projects of common interest to boost competitiveness and technological innovation. The question of innovation has been raised. I have just read an article by Professor Getz, saying that innovation should not just be developed in the research and development department of a company, it should be at all levels, from bottom to top. That is an interesting philosophy that could be considered when we are talking about how to boost innovation.\nTurning to SMEs, when we look at the 25 Member States, 92% of all the enterprises in the European Union are in the category of small and medium-sized enterprises. So when we talk about creating jobs and economic growth, we have to bear in mind that the vast majority fall within the category of small and medium-sized enterprises. That is what we are trying to take into account when we talk about giving them more attention than they have received up to now and to stimulate innovation and cooperation between, sometimes, a combination of research institutes, smaller companies and larger companies. It is a challenge to ensure that all those SMEs can take advantage of these opportunities.\nIt has rightly been mentioned that risk capital is not very developed in Europe. Compared to the United States, quite often innovative ideas are not taken up by companies that are small or just starting up because there is no backing from the banks. State aid to back those companies in their early development could be very helpful.\nMr Wortmann-Kool asked whether the Commission could raise the threshold. I am not saying that we would not be prepared to raise it. However, we should bear in mind that we are talking about SMEs and not large companies, and we should try to reduce bureaucracy and red tape. The amount of euros we are talking about really covers that category. So we shall be submitting a proposal quite soon, but do not be too optimistic, because I have heard on the grapevine that people are thinking of huge sums of money, but then we are not taking account of the category.\nOn the environment, the Commission cannot refuse to approve aid just because the objective pursued is not environmental. I am sure that is not the question that is being asked. We have to look at all the policies of the Union. However, the Commission shares the aim of reducing environmentally damaging State aid and we should all encourage Member States to take that into account when deciding on the subsidy.\nOn public services, services of general economic interest, the Commission\u2019s decision and framework makes clear how the State aid rules apply to public service compensation. The Commission is committed to reporting on the impact of those rules within the deadlines set by those instruments. As you know, the Commission does not consider a framework directive necessary. I am talking about less bureaucracy. I am being consistent and not saying that we should still do it when it is not necessary.\nFinally, the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs have done a great deal of work on this report and I am grateful that we can have a discussion with the same goal, i.e. more jobs for Europe, in a social context that we are proud to be living in.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Neelie Kroes, Member of the Commission .

The user provided a debate summary about State Aid Reform and wants me to focus on Neelie Kroes's contributions. First, I need to go through the debate summary carefully.\n\nLooking at the sections, under \"Key Positions and Arguments,\" there's a part about Commissioner Neelie Kroes. The summary says she endorsed the reform but emphasized careful implementation. Her quote is about handling it correctly to avoid negative effects. She supported the \"less and better\" approach and highlighted SMEs, mentioning they are 92% of EU enterprises.\n\nNow, the user's instruction is to outline the main points or arguments made by Neelie Kroes. The other speakers' contributions shouldn't be included. So I need to extract only her points.\n\nThe issueSum should mention the key issue she addressed, which is the implementation of state aid reform. Her position is supporting the reform but stressing careful handling. The arguments she made are about avoiding negative effects if not handled properly. The proposals or policy actions would be her emphasis on focusing on SMEs and the \"less and better\" approach.\n\nWait, the example response structure has four fields: issueSum, positionSum, argSum, propSum. Let me check each part.\n\nIssueSum: The key issue here is the implementation of the state aid reform. She talked about handling it correctly to prevent adverse effects.\n\nPositionSum: She endorsed the reform but emphasized careful implementation. Also, she supported the \"less and better\" approach and highlighted SMEs.\n\nArgSum: The reasoning behind her position is that improper handling could lead to negative outcomes, so she wants it done correctly.\n\nPropSum: Her proposals include focusing on SMEs and ensuring state aid is used wisely, perhaps? The summary mentions she supported the \"less and better\" approach and highlighted SMEs. The propSum should be about her specific proposals. The example given in the user's prompt for propSum was about strict limitations, so here it might be about focusing on SMEs and careful implementation.\n\nI need to make sure not to include other speakers' points. For instance, the part about SMEs is her point, not others. The user's example response for propSum was \"He advocates for strict limitations on government demands for private data,\" so similarly, here it's about her proposals.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nissueSum: The key issue is the implementation of state aid reform, emphasizing careful handling to avoid negative effects.\n\npositionSum: She supported the reform but stressed the need for careful implementation, endorsing the \"less and better\" approach and highlighting the importance of SMEs.\n\nargSum: Her argument is that incorrect implementation could have the opposite effect of the intended solutions.\n\npropSum: She proposed focusing on SMEs and ensuring state aid is used wisely, with a focus on the \"less and better\" approach.\n\nI need to make sure each part is concise and only includes her contributions. Let me check again the original text. The summary says she \"endorsed the reform while emphasizing careful implementation\" and \"supported the 'less and better' approach while highlighting the need to focus on SMEs.\" So the propSum would be her proposals, which are the \"less and better\" approach and focusing on SMEs. But the example's propSum is a specific action, so maybe rephrase to \"proposed careful implementation and a focus on SMEs\" or similar.\n\nYes, that should work.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The implementation of state aid reform and its potential impact on market efficiency and SMEs.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"Supported the reform's 'less and better' approach but emphasized the need for careful implementation to avoid unintended negative consequences.\",\n\"argSum\": \"Stressed that improper implementation could turn state aid into a problem rather than a solution, highlighting the importance of balancing reform with practical considerations.\",\n\"propSum\": \"Advocated for focusing state aid on SMEs, which constitute 92% of EU enterprises, and ensuring it is used wisely to support economic growth without distorting competition.\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "President. \u2013", "english": "President. \u2013 The debate is closed.\nThe vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon.", "lang": "EN", "original": "President. \u2013 The debate is closed.\nThe vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon.", "agenda_item": "State aid reform (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060213-ITEM-012", "intervention_id": "1-140", "summary_english": "{\n\"headline\": \"\",\n\"issueSum\": \"\",\n\"positionSum\": \"\",\n\"argSum\": \"\",\n\"propSum\": \"\",\n\"quotes\": []\n}", "summary_original": "```json\n{\n  \"headline\": \"\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"\",\n  \"positionSum\": \"\",\n  \"argSum\": \"\",\n  \"propSum\": \"\",\n  \"quotes\": []\n}\n```", "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "method": "structured", "formatted_summary": {"headline": "", "issueSum": "", "positionSum": "", "argSum": "", "propSum": "", "quotes": []}, "reconstructed_position": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a parliamentary debate summary about State Aid Reform and asked about the President's contributions. But looking at the debate summary, the only mention of a President is in the example response, which seems to be a placeholder. The actual debate summary doesn't mention a President speaking. The speakers listed are like Gunnar H\u00f6kmark, Sophia in 't Veld, Commissioner Neelie Kroes, and others. There's no specific \"President\" mentioned as a speaker here.\n\nSo, the task is to outline the main points of the specified speaker. If the speaker isn't present in the debate summary, the response should be an empty JSON. The user's example response includes a President, but in the given debate, there's no info about a President's speech. Therefore, the correct answer is an empty string as per the instructions.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"\",\n\"positionSum\": \"\",\n\"argSum\": \"\",\n\"propSum\": \"\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}]
