Let me start by looking at the debate summary provided.\n\nThe user mentioned that the President is the speaker, but the executive summary doesn't have a section specifically about the President. The summary lists contributions from various speakers like Gunnar H\u00f6kmark, Neelie Kroes, Gilles Savary, Sophia in 't Veld, and others. However, the President isn't mentioned by name in the arguments listed. \n\nWait, the debate summary's \"Executive Summary\" section mentions the rapporteur (Gunnar H\u00f6kmark) and the Commission's support (Neelie Kroes), but there's no mention of the President's contributions. The key areas of contention and other sections also don't attribute any statements to the President. The \"Opposition Voices\" section lists Diamanto Manolakou and Graham Booth, but again, not the President. \n\nThe user might be referring to the President of the European Parliament or another official, but based on the information given, there's no specific arguments or contributions attributed to the President in the provided debate summary. The summary doesn't include any quotes or points made by the President. \n\nTherefore, since the instructions say to only include points attributed to the speaker (in this case, the President) and if there are none, respond with an empty string. So the answer should be an empty string because there's no information about the President's contributions in the given summary.\n</think>\n\n\"", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Gunnar H\u00f6kmark (PPE-DE),", "english": "Gunnar H\u00f6kmark (PPE-DE), rapporteur . \u2013 Mr President, the roadmap for State aid reform from the Commission is a good and an important document. I hope that this report will contribute to the improvement of the State aid policy. Therefore, I should like to thank colleagues and shadow rapporteurs who have contributed to this improvement by the amendments and discussions we have had in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. I hope there will be, as there was in the committee, broad support for this new policy, which I hope will make an impact on the future guidelines on State aid policy that the Commission will be responsible for.\n(SV) Mr\u00a0President, Europe needs a competitive economy. As we say over and over again, we need new businesses, new jobs, new products and new markets. It is, therefore, also important to follow these matters up by ensuring that new, small companies operate under basic conditions as good as those under which old, large companies operate. Experience of various kinds teaches us that State aid always tends to safeguard old, existing companies at the expense of new and growing companies.\nIf we look around at the European economy, as well as at the international economy, we see very clearly that the new companies and the new products have emerged not through State aid but through the existence of sound basic conditions for businesses and individual entrepreneurs. Each type of State aid that distorts competition always tends to distort it at the expense of what is new and growing and to the advantage of what is old. This is therefore an issue that, to the highest degree, is about how we are to obtain new jobs and new businesses. A policy of State aid whereby we preserve businesses that are not very competitive, together with old products and low wages, will contribute to Europe lagging behind. However, a policy that aims for less State aid and at removing such State aid as distorts competition and that, moreover, invests resources in innovation and research will be able to produce a different outcome.\nIn European history, we have a lot to learn from a whole range of different experiences where State aid is concerned. In my report, I write that the Commission needs carefully to monitor and analyse these experiences, as well as the good experiences there are, because the objective of State aid is often popular and generally approved of. The problem is simply that the results of it are rarely what one had imagined they would be. As a consequence, we end up with old structures and with a dependency on subsidies, and we do not produce new jobs. We have seen this within the shipbuilding and steel industries and within a great many other sectors. Where State aid is introduced, renewal and transformation go out of the window. We must ensure that the opposite situation comes about.\nAn overarching objective of the report is to follow up the general aim not only of reducing State aid but also, as stated clearly in the report and still more clearly in the Commission\u2019s document, of removing such State aid as distorts competition. A further objective is to ensure that those rules that exist are made clearer, for the aim must be to follow up the demand for less State aid. What is required is that State aid be predictable. It must not be possible for it to be used for relocations. The rules governing State aid must be generally applicable. The aid must not have a specific focus, but be directed across the board and not favour one company at the expense of another. That is extremely important when we debate innovation, for innovation policy must not be an excuse for increased State aid but be designed to create better basic conditions for innovation. The same applies to companies in the public interest. We must not have State aid that funds that type of activity excessively, but must give new companies opportunities to develop.\nThe same may be said of regional or environmental aid. It must be directed across the board and so made open and accessible to all.

The key quotes from him are: \"State aid always tends to safeguard old, existing companies at the expense of new and growing companies\" and \"where State aid is introduced, renewal and transformation go out of the window.\" He advocates for significant reductions in State aid, emphasizing market-driven innovation over protective subsidies.\n\nSo, the main points here are that he believes State aid favors existing companies over new ones, which hinders innovation. He wants to reduce State aid to promote a more dynamic market. Also, he's against protective subsidies, pushing for a market-driven approach. \n\nI need to make sure I don't include other speakers' arguments. The user specified that only the points attributed to Gunnar H\u00f6kmark should be included. The summary also mentions that the Commission's approach is \"less and better,\" but that's from Commissioner Kroes, not H\u00f6kmark. \n\nSo, the answer should focus solely on H\u00f6kmark's arguments as presented. He's against State aid because it stifles innovation by protecting old companies, and he wants to reduce it to encourage market-driven growth. That's it. No other contributions from other speakers should be included. Let me check again to ensure I didn't miss any other points from him. The summary also says he established the debate's foundation with these arguments. Yep, that's all.

We also want to improve the procedures and administration of State aid policy, as was rightly touched upon by the rapporteur.\nOne important message in the report is the need for legal certainty. I fully share the concern that, if we are not successful in making that legal certainty visible, then we will have failed. The Commission will explain further how it intends to use economics for State aid policy. Market failure is not a magic word; it is, rather, a methodology to analyse the problems within markets. I agree with the report\u2019s focus on the need for transparency of aid. On services of general economic interest, the Commission has no competence to interpret the jurisprudence. Nevertheless \u2013 I got your message, Mr President! \u2013 the Commission will try to give guidance when adopting decisions on individual cases in this field.\nI look forward to your questions and comments, and I will do my utmost to respond to them.", "reconstructed_position": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the main points or arguments made by Neelie Kroes in the parliamentary debate on State aid reform. Let me start by looking at the debate summary provided.\n\nFirst, the user mentioned that the debate was about State aid reform, and the speaker in question is Neelie Kroes. The summary has a section titled \"Commission Support\" which mentions Neelie Kroes. Let me check that part.\n\nIn the \"Commission Support\" section, it says that Commissioner Neelie Kroes strongly endorsed the reform agenda, emphasizing the \"less and better\" approach to State aid. She argued that \"State aid should be used wisely, because it is taxpayers' money\" and warned against allowing \"a subsidy race between the Member States.\" Also, she mentioned that the Commission wanted to provide companies with \"a hook to those who need a bit of help, instead of just giving them the fish.\"\n\nSo, the main points here are: supporting the \"less and better\" approach, emphasizing wise use of taxpayers' money, warning against subsidy races, and focusing on helping those who need it rather than just giving aid. I need to make sure these are the only points attributed to her. The rest of the summary mentions other speakers, but the user wants only the arguments from Neelie Kroes. \n\nI should check if there are any other mentions of her in the summary. Looking through the other sections like \"Key Areas of Contention\" or \"Opposition Voices,\" I don't see any other direct quotes or arguments from her. The rest of the summary refers to other speakers like H\u00f6kmark, Savary, in 't Veld, etc. \n\nTherefore, the main points from Neelie Kroes are the ones mentioned in the \"Commission Support\" section. I need to present these clearly, ensuring not to include any other speakers' arguments. The user also mentioned that if there are no points, I should return an empty string, but in this case, there are points. So the answer should list her arguments as per the summary.\n</think>\n\nNeelie Kroes emphasized the Commission's \"less and better\" approach to State aid, advocating for its use to be \"wise\" given it is \"taxpayers' money.\" She warned against a \"subsidy race between the Member States\" and stated the Commission aimed to provide \"a hook to those who need a bit of help, instead of just giving them the fish.\"", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Milo\u0161 Koterec (PSE),", "english": "Milo\u0161 Koterec (PSE), rapporteur of the Committee on Regional Development, asked for an opinion . \u2013 (SK) As a\u00a0member of the Committee on Regional Development and rapporteur for the recently adopted report on State aid for regional development, allow me to make a\u00a0few points concerning the possible implications of the reform of State aid for economic, social and territorial cohesion.\nIn its document, the Commission correctly indicates that State aid is an important factor in ensuring homogenous regional development, thereby strengthening one of the fundamental economic pillars of the European Union. I would like to take this opportunity to raise the issue of regional bonuses. It seems to me that in striving to attain the Lisbon Agenda parameters it would be logical to invest more in regions that are lagging behind, otherwise we risk creating only advanced, competitive enclaves that will inevitably be held back by the depressed areas, thus preventing the all-round growth of the European Union.\nIn addition, I\u00a0would like to emphasise the need to simplify procedures and to make the whole system of State aid provision transparent. Maximum transparency should be applied rigorously to the process of allocating and approving State aid. All persons and entities applying for aid in support of their activities must feel sure, in the event that they are turned down, that it was for objective reasons. Similarly, they must be informed about who has been granted aid, and why. This will generate a spirit of trust, and will enable citizens to have faith that the EU system is functioning in a uniform way.\nNational governments are important elements that can either support or disrupt this system. If they are given more responsibility for taking decisions on State aid provision, their decisions and activities must be subject to the transparency of the entire system. I\u00a0hope, Mr President, that we will all be able to conclude, following the reform of State aid provision, that the system really has been improved, and that it will contribute in a clearly objective manner to the uniform development of the European Union.", "lang": "SK", "original": "Milo\u0161 Koterec (PSE), Spravodajca V\u00fdboru pre region\u00e1lny rozvoj po\u017eiadan\u00e9ho o stanovisko . \u2013 Dovo\u013ete, aby som ako \u010dlen V\u00fdboru pre region\u00e1lny rozvoj a spravodajca pre ned\u00e1vno prijat\u00fa spr\u00e1vu o \u0161t\u00e1tnej pomoci pri region\u00e1lnom rozvoji povedal p\u00e1r slov z poh\u013eadu mo\u017en\u00fdch vplyvov reformy \u0161t\u00e1tnej pomoci na hospod\u00e1rsku, soci\u00e1lnu a teritori\u00e1lnu koh\u00e9ziu.\nAko Komisia vo svojom dokumente spr\u00e1vne kon\u0161tatuje, poskytovanie \u0161t\u00e1tnej pomoci je d\u00f4le\u017eit\u00fdm faktorom zabezpe\u010denia rovnomern\u00e9ho region\u00e1lneho rozvoja, a tak podporou jedn\u00e9ho zo z\u00e1kladn\u00fdch ekonomick\u00fdch pilierov Eur\u00f3pskej \u00fanie.

Let me start by reading through the provided information carefully.\n\nFirst, the debate is about State aid reform, and the speaker in question is Jos\u00e9 Manuel Garc\u00eda-Margallo y Marfil from the PPE-DE group. The user wants only the points attributed to him, so I need to look for any mentions of his contributions in the summary.\n\nLooking at the \"Executive Summary\" section, there's a part under \"Key Proposals and Compromises\" that mentions Jos\u00e9 Manuel Garc\u00eda-Margallo y Marfil. The text says: \"Jos\u00e9 Manuel Garc\u00eda-Margallo y Marfil (PPE-DE) advocated including 'fiscal incentives that do not respond to the nature of the tax, but which respond to the desire to stimulate certain activities in geographical areas' [Garc\u00eda-Margallo y Marfil, 2006-02-13].\" \n\nSo his main argument here is about fiscal incentives. He's suggesting that these incentives should be based on stimulating specific activities in certain regions rather than being tied to the tax structure. This seems to be part of the discussion on practical reforms, possibly related to de minimis thresholds or reducing bureaucracy for SMEs. \n\nI need to make sure there are no other mentions of him elsewhere. Scanning through the rest of the summary, I don't see any other quotes or references to Garc\u00eda-Margallo y Marfil. The other speakers mentioned are H\u00f6kmark, Kroes, Savary, in 't Veld, Koterec, Allister, Schroedter, Manolakou, Booth, and others, but not him. \n\nTherefore, the only point attributed to him is his advocacy for fiscal incentives that target specific regional activities. The user wants the answer to include only his arguments, so I should present that as the main point. Since there's only one argument, I'll structure the response accordingly.\n</think>\n\nJos\u00e9 Manuel Garc\u00eda-Margallo y Marfil advocated for including \"fiscal incentives that do not respond to the nature of the tax, but which respond to the desire to stimulate certain activities in geographical areas\" [Garc\u00eda-Margallo y Marfil, 2006-02-13].

We are in fact dealing here with a non-legislative report, and I believe that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has done a good job in terms of voicing the European Parliament\u2019s strong position. On the whole, we have managed to end up with a fairly clear outlook on things.\nI am one of those who believe, along with the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, that we do in fact need to review the State aid system. This system is more than ever at the heart of the Commission\u2019s powers, since Europe remains essentially a Europe of the internal market and competition until further notice. I am not sure whether the \u2018No\u2019 vote in the French referendum offers other prospects for the long-term future. We are therefore truly at the heart of Community powers here, and it is true that, with the enlargement of Europe, the European Union and the Commission are at risk of thrombosis if the State aid system and arrangements are left in their current state.\nParliament has above all stressed that the internal market and competition should not be regarded as representing every aspect of European society. We are not just a market society; there must, as the texts stipulate, also be room for public action, not only on all those occasions when the market is failing, but also on all those occasions when we need to reduce social or territorial inequalities, manage external effects, promote innovation and, should the need arise, give a boost to industry. When, at times, we shift to a free market way of thinking, we sometimes find ourselves wondering: \u2018Would we be in a position today to build the Airbus or would we be in a position to build the Ariane rocket, given the dominant ideology?\u2019 I believe that we must retain this opportunity to intervene very forcefully in the industrial landscape and in public research.\nI should like to say to the Commissioner that the main contribution of Parliament is to ensure that State aid is not assessed as something merely to be borne but, rather, is assessed in a balanced way, that is to say that not only are the negative aspects, such as distortions of competition, considered, but so too are the positive effects. We, in the European Parliament, wanted the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality to be clearly applied and, more specifically, wanted State aid that has no obvious impact on the internal market to be considered as compensation. We also wanted market failures to be better understood.\nFinally, I should like to mention the issues that still need to be discussed and that are referred to in the 21 amendments tabled. With regard to public services, we need clarification on those aspects to do with compensation, with the legitimate funding of public services and with subsidiary funding and, above all, we need clarification on what constitutes the fourth criterion set out in the Altmark judgment, a criterion that, by the Commission\u2019s own admission, is actually extremely vague and very difficult to handle.\nWith regard to innovation, Mrs\u00a0in 't Veld will soon present us with her report. We believe that it is a very good text and we hope to enhance it. The question that must be asked concerns the scope of the report: should it be strictly confined to innovation, or should it branch out a little further into the area of research and development? With regard to the regions, some excellent amendments are focused on preventing relocations from being funded by State aid. This is an extremely serious problem because it gives Europeans the impression that they are being pitted against one another, and this in terms, furthermore, of the amount received by way of public subsidies.\nFinally, I should like to conclude by saying that we are obviously totally in favour of State aid being considered in the framework of the Lisbon Process and the Gothenburg Process, that is to say not only in terms of the knowledge-based economy, but also in terms of helping the environment.", "lang": "FR", "original": "Gilles Savary, au nom du groupe PSE . - Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, je voudrais remercier notre rapporteur M.

Ce probl\u00e8me est extr\u00eamement grave car il donne l\u2019impression aux Europ\u00e9ens qu\u2019on les met en concurrence les uns avec les autres avec, qui plus est, des subventions publiques.\nEnfin, je voudrais terminer par vous dire que nous sommes naturellement tout \u00e0 fait favorables \u00e0 ce que les aides d\u2019\u00c9tat soient pens\u00e9es dans le cadre du processus de Lisbonne et de G\u00f6teborg: \u00e9conomie de la connaissance, mais aussi aide \u00e0 l\u2019environnement.", "reconstructed_position": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out the main points or arguments made by Gilles Savary in the parliamentary debate on State aid reform. Let me start by looking at the debate summary provided.\n\nFirst, the user mentioned that the task is to outline the main points attributed to the specific speaker, in this case, Gilles Savary. The summary has a section titled \"Key Areas of Contention\" which includes his arguments. Let me check that part again.\n\nUnder \"Market Efficiency vs. Social Objectives,\" there's a mention of Gilles Savary (PSE) arguing against viewing Europe as purely market-driven. He said, \"We are not just a market society; there must also be room for public action\" [Savary, 2006-02-13]. He also questioned whether the EU could still \"build the Airbus or build the Ariane rocket, given the dominant ideology\" [Savary, 2006-02-13].\n\nSo, his main points seem to be about opposing a purely market-driven approach and emphasizing the need for public action. He's concerned that the dominant ideology (which might be the market-oriented reforms) could hinder major projects like Airbus and Ariane rocket, which are significant for Europe. \n\nI need to make sure there are no other mentions of Savary elsewhere in the summary. Let me scan through the other sections. The \"Opposition Voices\" section mentions other speakers like Manolakou and Booth, but not Savary. The \"Key Proposals and Compromises\" section talks about others like Garc\u00eda-Margallo y Marfil. So, the only points are from the \"Key Areas of Contention\" section.\n\nTherefore, the arguments attributed to Gilles Savary are: \n1. Opposing a purely market-driven approach, advocating for public action.\n2. Questioning the ability of the EU to undertake major projects under the dominant ideology of market efficiency.\n\nI should present these as the main points without including other speakers' arguments. The user also mentioned that if there are no points, I should return an empty string, but in this case, there are two points.\n</think>\n\nGilles Savary argued against a purely market-driven approach to State aid, emphasizing the need for public action to complement market mechanisms. He questioned whether the EU could sustain major strategic projects, such as the Airbus and Ariane rocket programs, under the prevailing focus on market efficiency, suggesting that the dominant ideology risked undermining such critical initiatives.", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Sophia in 't Veld,", "english": "Sophia in 't Veld, on behalf of the ALDE Group . \u2013 (NL) Mr President, first of all, I should like to add my voice in support of Mr H\u00f6kmark\u2019s excellent report, which we as a group will be backing, and we also support the choice which the Commission has made in favour of less and better-targeted state support, in which respect I should like to stress once again, lest we forget, that the amounts involved are actually lower. State support should be a last resort and is not a panacea. Although it may be presented in that way from time to time, it also has adverse side effects.\nAt the same time, we can be open-handed in granting state support only after all pre-conditions and our other items of policy have been complied with, or else we would end up fighting a running battle. We must, for example, ensure that the internal market is completed and functions well and in that respect, I hope that this House will be taking a sensible decision on Thursday with regard to the services directive.\nWe must counter protectionism, promote fair competition, abolish red tape and excessive legislation, guarantee better access to risk capital and also establish an internal market for financial services, but at the same time, we must put in place such things as truly free movement for workers from all EU Member States and an immigration policy that is geared towards keeping the brightest and best, our top people, in Europe rather than chasing them away to the United States.\nOnly when those things are in place can we see whether we might be able to intervene with State aid where the market is inefficient, for we are not so much dealing with market failure as we are with market inefficiencies.\nI should also like to repeat that State aid should, in principle, not be sanctioned. It disrupts the market and distorts competition. Mr Savary said a moment ago that the EU has a tendency to be too liberal, but I should like to draw Mr Savary\u2019s attention to the fact that we spend billions on State aid each year. Even by the most conservative estimates, the amounts involved are more or less half of the EU\u2019s budget, so that is not terribly liberal in my view. Things could be a bit more liberal as far as I am concerned.\nI also agree with what Mr Savary said a moment ago: we must set aside State aid for the priorities of the twenty-first century: the Lisbon objectives, innovation, knowledge, sustainability \u2026\nConsequently, I think that we should give far less State aid to obsolete and obsolescent industries, and as far as State aid for environmental objectives is concerned, I think we should first set to abolishing the billions of State aid we grant the many polluting industries and sectors that make use of sources of non-renewable energy, and I will therefore advise my group to support Mr Lipietz\u2019s amendments to that effect.\nGlobal context is also important in the debate. We cannot deny, of course, that in other parts of the world, liberal amounts of State aid are still being given out. That much we should recognise, but our objective to reduce State aid remains intact.\nFinally, I should like to say a few words on public services. I should like to repeat \u2013 and I am increasingly feeling like a voice in the wilderness in this respect \u2013 that the phrases \u2018services of general interest\u2019 and \u2018services of general economic interest\u2019 have still not been defined, and it is, in that light, very odd to legislate for them. That is just by the by.\nAs Mr Savary mentioned a moment ago, legal certainty and clarity are urgently needed for those public services.\nI should like to finish by asking the Commission to submit, at the earliest opportunity, an assessment of the impact which the rules that the Commission adopted last year had on State aid as compensation for public services. I would like to know the amount of State aid involved, the number of companies involved and what impact this had on the market.", "lang": "NL", "original": "Sophia in \u2019t Veld, namens de ALDE-Fractie . \u2013 Voorzitter, allereerst wil ik mijn steun betuigen aan het uitstekende rapport van de heer H\u00f6kmark, waar wij ons als fractie achter zullen stellen, en we steunen ook de keuze die de Commissie heeft gemaakt, nl. minder en betere staatssteun, waarbij ik nog een keer zou willen onderstrepen dat het dus \u00f3\u00f3k gaat om minder, laten we dat niet vergeten.

Let me check the relevant section.\n\nUnder the \"Key Areas of Contention\" section, there's a part about Market Efficiency vs. Social Objectives. It says Sophia in 't Veld (ALDE) took a more market-oriented stance, noting that \"we spend billions on State aid each year.

I think it would be a good thing if there were a bonus not only for innovation, but also, and primarily, for environmental information, and I think it regrettable that this is absent from the Commissioner\u2019s draft.\nSecondly, one important feature of the report is the fact that the de minimis rules really must be applied to businesses with at least EUR\u00a0200 000 per annum. I have to say, Commissioner, that they are very generalised, and that is not enough. We know that these businesses are needed in rural areas if they are to enjoy the most basic economic development, just as we know that the regions affected by population change need businesses to settle in them, and if they are to do that they will need State aid.

It is not acceptable that such rules should qualify the Altmark ruling, for the risk then arises of the Commission using competition rules as a means of defining what general interest actually means \u2013 the very same thing that you are trying to do by means of the services directive, that controversial document in which you sacrifice general interest on the altar of the free market.\nWhat we need, then \u2013 and urgently, too \u2013 is a framework directive, even if you do not see yourself as having that responsibility, and we need one in this instance because we want the social Europe to stand on secure foundations, one of the most fundamental of which is services of general interest, and the public will turn their backs on Europe if these become the victim of rules on competition.", "lang": "DE", "original": "Elisabeth Schroedter, im Namen der Verts/ALE-Fraktion . \u2013 Herr Pr\u00e4sident!

Anders k\u00f6nnen wir solchen Effekten nicht entgegenwirken. Ich finde es deswegen wichtig, dass hier eine deutliche Erh\u00f6hung stattfindet.\nZum Schluss komme ich zu den Regeln f\u00fcr Unternehmen f\u00fcr Dienstleistungen des allgemeinen wirtschaftlichen Interesses. Es darf nicht sein, dass diese Regeln das Altmark-Urteil einschr\u00e4nken, denn dann besteht die Gefahr, dass die Kommission \u00fcber die Wettbewerbsregeln definiert, was Daseinsvorsorge ist. Das ist genau der gleiche Versuch, den Sie in der Dienstleistungsrichtlinie machen, wo Sie in Ihrem umstrittenen Text die Daseinsvorsorge dem freien Markt opfern.\nDeshalb sage ich: Wir brauchen dringend eine Rahmenregelung, auch wenn Sie sich daf\u00fcr nicht verantwortlich f\u00fchlen. Wir brauchen sie in diesem Fall, denn wir wollen, dass ein soziales Europa gefestigt wird. Dabei ist die Daseinsvorsorge ein zentraler Punkt, und er kann nicht Wettbewerbsregeln geopfert werden, denn dann wenden sich die B\u00fcrgerinnen und B\u00fcrger von Europa ab.", "reconstructed_position": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the main points or arguments made by Elisabeth Schroedter in the parliamentary debate on State Aid Reform. Let me start by looking through the provided debate summary.\n\nFirst, the user mentioned that the response should only include the points attributed to the specific speaker, which in this case is Elisabeth Schroedter. The summary has a section titled \"Environmental and Innovation Priorities\" where she is mentioned. Let me check that part again.\n\nIn the summary, under \"Environmental and Innovation Priorities,\" it says: \"Elisabeth Schroedter (Verts/ALE) emphasized that 'Europe is competitive only if it is also innovative in the ways in which it protects the environment' [Schroedter, 2006-02-13]. Multiple speakers supported focusing aid on research, development, and environmental technologies.\"\n\nSo the key point here is that Elisabeth Schroedter argued for linking Europe's competitiveness to innovation in environmental protection. She believed that state aid should be directed towards research, development, and environmental technologies. The summary also mentions that multiple speakers supported focusing aid on these areas, but since the user wants only the points from Elisabeth Schroedter, I should focus on her specific statement.\n\nI need to make sure there are no other mentions of her in the summary. Let me scan through the rest of the document. The other sections like \"Rapporteur's Framework,\" \"Commission Support,\" \"Key Areas of Contention,\" \"Opposition Voices,\" and \"Key Proposals and Compromises\" don't mention her again. The conclusion also doesn't reference her. \n\nTherefore, the only argument attributed to her is the one about competitiveness through innovation in environmental protection. The summary doesn't provide any other quotes or points from her. So the answer should include that single point.\n</think>\n\nElisabeth Schroedter (Verts/ALE) emphasized that \"Europe is competitive only if it is also innovative in the ways in which it protects the environment\" [Schroedter, 2006-02-13]. She advocated for redirecting state aid towards research, development, and environmental technologies to align competitiveness with ecological innovation.", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Diamanto Manolakou,", "english": "Diamanto Manolakou, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group . \u2013 (EL) Mr President, State aid, in other words the workers' money, is in the firing line, the objective being to reduce it and have management of it controlled by the European Union, so that it can serve the Lisbon Strategy. This means less State aid for grass-roots needs and servicing of the competitiveness of European capital. In other words, the people's money will be not for grass-roots prosperity, but for the profitability of capital.\nThe references to State aid for purposes of general interest and in the public good at European Union level not only demonstrate indifference to the asymmetrical development between the Member States, but also prejudge that such a procedure will further strengthen this asymmetrical development by increasing inequality and injustice.\nIt is vital, they say, to reduce State aid, in order for it to have positive results. Do remote rural and island areas, such as those in my country, in which capital does not invest because there is no or little profit, really have to be abandoned completely, including by State aid, and be laid to waste? They are already being abandoned, to a degree, and it looks like this will intensify in future.\nPublic services are being privatised, basic grass-roots needs are being commercialised. The reduction in State aid and its orientation towards servicing the anti-grass roots Lisbon Strategy will exacerbate still further the situation of the grass-roots classes. Despite the reference to the financing of small- and medium-sized enterprises for investments, unfortunately the evidence shows that, so far, economic aid for small businesses has been non-existent or has been dispensed with a dropper. By contrast, for big business there has been open-handedness and it is big business that benefits and, with today's proposals, will be strengthened even more.", "lang": "EL", "original":

by Diamanto Manolakou in the parliamentary debate on State Aid Reform. Let me start by looking at the debate summary provided.\n\nFirst, the user mentioned that the task is to outline the main points attributed to the specific speaker, in this case, Diamanto Manolakou. The summary has a section titled \"Opposition Voices\" which includes her. Let me check that part.\n\nIn the \"Opposition Voices\" section, it says: \"Diamanto Manolakou (GUE/NGL) provided the strongest opposition, arguing that State aid reform serves 'the competitiveness of European capital' rather than 'grass-roots prosperity' [Manolakou, 2006-02-13]. She warned that reducing aid would abandon 'remote rural and island areas' where 'capital does not invest because there is no or little profit' [Manolakou, 2006-02-13].\"\n\nSo her main arguments are that the reform is beneficial for European capital's competitiveness but not for grassroots prosperity. She's against reducing aid because it would leave remote areas without support since capital doesn't invest there. \n\nI need to make sure there are no other mentions of her in the summary. Let me scan through the other sections. The core positions, key areas of contention, etc. The other speakers mentioned are H\u00f6kmark, Kroes, Savary, in 't Veld, Koterec, Allister, Schroedter, Garc\u00eda-Margallo y Marfil, Manolakou, and Booth. \n\nIn the \"Key Proposals and Compromises\" section, there's no mention of Manolakou. The conclusion also doesn't reference her. So the only points are from the \"Opposition Voices\" section. \n\nTherefore, the main points are her opposition to the reform, stating it serves capital's competitiveness over grassroots prosperity, and her warning about abandoning remote areas. I should present these as the arguments made by her. The user said to not include other speakers' contributions, so I need to stick strictly to her points. \n\nI need to check if there's any other information. The summary mentions her party is GUE/NGL, but the user didn't ask for that. The task is just the arguments. So the answer should be the two points: the reform's focus on capital vs. grassroots, and the risk to remote areas. \n\nI think that's all. No other points attributed to her. The user also mentioned if there are no points, respond with an empty string, but here there are two points.\n</think>\n\nDiamanto Manolakou argued that State aid reform prioritized \"the competitiveness of European capital\" over \"grass-roots prosperity,\" contending that reducing aid would neglect \"remote rural and island areas\" where \"capital does not invest because there is no or little profit.\" She framed the reform as detrimental to disadvantaged regions and emphasized the need to protect areas reliant on public support.", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Graham Booth,", "english": "Graham Booth, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . \u2013 Mr President, it would be very nice if we were able to throw endless amounts of money at our relatively poor East European neighbours, but history has shown that by doing that you do not make the poor rich, you simply make the rich poor.

He advocated for free trade over State aid as a development strategy.\"\n\nSo, from this, Graham Booth's arguments are about opposing the expansion of State aid to new member states. His main points are:\n\n1. Opposing the expansion of aid to new member states, believing that it doesn't help the poor but instead harms the rich.\n2. Advocating for free trade instead of State aid as a development strategy.\n\nI need to make sure there are no other mentions of Graham Booth elsewhere in the summary.

The Commissioner\u2019s contribution also gave great cause for hope.\nThe reform of policy on State aid is enormously important to people at the local level, where the towns, boroughs and regions are the main sources of public investments. As has already been said, their municipal enterprises play an important part in guaranteeing the provision of services of general interest, and so it is important that the Commission should \u2013 as it has already agreed to do \u2013 announce how it proposes to implement the criteria set out in the ECJ\u2019s ruling in the Altmark case. If legal disputes are to be avoided, those who will have to apply these criteria must have a clear idea of what the Commission\u2019s policy is. The more concrete the Altmark criteria are, the more difficult they are to implement, and the individual public offices cannot be expected to get to grips with the fundamental principle and determine for themselves whether or not aid has been granted on the basis of the avoidance of overcompensation using market compensations; to do so would involve them in a quite unjustifiable amount of bureaucracy. The local offices could, though, be enabled to do that if \u2013 as has indeed already been announced \u2013 they had access to workable guidelines with which, for example, they could determine which market was relevant.

I think that it is once again thanks to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs that we have managed, with a very liberal Swedish perspective and at the same time a Socialist French perspective, to achieve a good outcome after all.\nIn contrast to my Dutch fellow Member, Mrs in \u2019t Veld, I will not make a case for less State aid. In my view, this \u2018less is more\u2019 mind-set is not the most important dimension. What matters is for what purpose and how this State aid is deployed. State aid should not only be seen as a deviation or aberration from perfect market forces, but as an instrument for achieving socio-economic objectives.\nIt is to be welcomed that the current Commissioner for Competition also sees her portfolio in such a broader economic context, to include the Lisbon strategy, for this strategy is not just about economic, but also about broader socio-economic effects. This socio-economic context and this additional perspective of employment and social cohesion are also the very aspects I should like to stress on behalf of my group.\nI should, in this context, like to mention two points in respect of which I would ask you not to be too dogmatic in your approach.\nFirst of all, with regard to market failure, it is important to look at the bigger picture in that area too, and to take full account of employment and social cohesion. The other point is the temporary nature of State aid. Here too, I would ask you to allow for some degree of flexibility, because some sectors might well need government subsidies and government instruments in the longer term \u2013 national radio and television spring to mind. The importance of plurality of the press and a good balance in the provision of information may require longer-term investments of government funds into sectors of that kind.\nPublic housing is another example. Given the interests of town and country planning, the integration of minorities and social integration in cities, certain players within the market may well be granted government support in order to achieve those broader objectives.\nFinally, with regard to the European and national dimensions, I should like to point out, as indeed Mr\u00a0H\u00f6kmark did in his report, that State aid can be used from time to time to stir up policy competition between Member States, and I should like to ask the Commission to keep an eye on this and to monitor this more closely, and to check whether it is the Member States themselves and not just the companies that are granted State aid that have to have sanctions imposed on them.", "lang": "NL", "original": "Ieke van den Burg (PSE). \u2013 Voorzitter, ook ik zou mij willen voegen bij degenen die de rapporteur, maar ook de schaduwrapporteurs feliciteren met het behaalde resultaat. Ik denk dat het ook weer een compliment is voor de Commissie economische en monetaire zaken dat we erin slagen met een zeer liberale Zweedse invalshoek en tegelijk een socialistische Franse invalshoek toch tot goede resultaten te komen.\nIn tegenstelling tot mijn Nederlandse collega mevrouw in \u2019t Veld zou ik niet de nadruk willen leggen op minder staatssteun. Ik denk dat dit minder-meer niet de belangrijkste dimensie is. Het gaat erom met welk doel en hoe die staatssteun wordt ingezet. Staatssteun moet niet alleen gezien worden als een afwijking, een aberratie ten opzichte van perfecte marktwerking, maar als een instrument voor sociale, economische en maatschappelijke doelen.\nHet is positief dat deze Commissaris van mededinging haar portefeuille ook in zo\u2019n bredere economische context ziet, nl. de Lissabon-strategie, en in die Lissabon-strategie gaat het inderdaad niet alleen over economische, maar ook over bredere sociaal-economische effecten. Dus vanuit mijn fractie zou ik met name ook dat willen benadrukken, die sociaal economische context en die bijkomende invalshoek van werkgelegenheid en sociale cohesie.\nIn dit verband zou ik twee punten willen noemen en willen vragen om op die punten geen te dogmatische benadering te kiezen.\nIn de eerste plaats het marktfalen. Daar gaat het er ook om naar bredere aspecten te kijken en volop rekening met werkgelegenheid en sociale cohesie te houden. Het andere punt is het tijdelijke karakter van de staatssteun. Ook daar zou ik ervoor willen pleiten er niet te dogmatisch mee om te gaan, want het kan zijn dat het in sommige sectoren wel degelijk nodig is om ook voor wat langere termijn met overheidssubsidies en overheidsinstrumenten te werken. Ik noem bijvoorbeeld de publieke omroep: het belang van pluraliteit van de pers en een goed evenwicht in de informatievoorziening kan vereisen dat er ook op langere termijn overheidsgeld in zo\u2019n sector gestoken wordt.\nVolkshuisvesting is een ander voorbeeld. Daar kan het ook zijn dat de belangen van stedenbouwkundige planning, het integreren van minderheden en sociale integratie in een stad vereisen dat je bepaalde spelers op de markt voorziet van overheidssteun om die ruimere doelstellingen te kunnen halen.\nDe laatste opmerking gaat over de Europese dimensie en de nationale dimensie. Daar zou ik erop willen wijzen, en dat heeft de heer H\u00f6kmark in het verslag ook gedaan, op het feit dat staatssteun nog wel eens gebruikt wordt om beleidsconcurrentie tussen lidstaten te voeren en ik zou de Commissie willen vragen daarop te letten, daar vanuit de Commissie sterker op toe te zien en ook op het gebied van sanctionering te kijken of de lidstaten zelf op dit punt niet aangepakt moeten worden en niet alleen de bedrijven waar de steun naartoe gaat.", "agenda_item": "State aid reform (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060213-ITEM-012", "intervention_id": "1-126", "summary_english": "{\n  \"headline\": \"Supports Flexible Approach to State Aid Reform with Focus on Socio-Economic Objectives Beyond Market Efficiency\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"The speaker addresses state aid reform, emphasizing the need to view state aid as an instrument for achieving socio-economic objectives rather than merely a market deviation.

Ik denk dat het ook weer een compliment is voor de Commissie economische en monetaire zaken dat we erin slagen met een zeer liberale Zweedse invalshoek en tegelijk een socialistische Franse invalshoek toch tot goede resultaten te komen.\nIn tegenstelling tot mijn Nederlandse collega mevrouw in \u2019t Veld zou ik niet de nadruk willen leggen op minder staatssteun. Ik denk dat dit minder-meer niet de belangrijkste dimensie is. Het gaat erom met welk doel en hoe die staatssteun wordt ingezet. Staatssteun moet niet alleen gezien worden als een afwijking, een aberratie ten opzichte van perfecte marktwerking, maar als een instrument voor sociale, economische en maatschappelijke doelen.\nHet is positief dat deze Commissaris van mededinging haar portefeuille ook in zo\u2019n bredere economische context ziet, nl. de Lissabon-strategie, en in die Lissabon-strategie gaat het inderdaad niet alleen over economische, maar ook over bredere sociaal-economische effecten. Dus vanuit mijn fractie zou ik met name ook dat willen benadrukken, die sociaal economische context en die bijkomende invalshoek van werkgelegenheid en sociale cohesie.\nIn dit verband zou ik twee punten willen noemen en willen vragen om op die punten geen te dogmatische benadering te kiezen.\nIn de eerste plaats het marktfalen. Daar gaat het er ook om naar bredere aspecten te kijken en volop rekening met werkgelegenheid en sociale cohesie te houden. Het andere punt is het tijdelijke karakter van de staatssteun. Ook daar zou ik ervoor willen pleiten er niet te dogmatisch mee om te gaan, want het kan zijn dat het in sommige sectoren wel degelijk nodig is om ook voor wat langere termijn met overheidssubsidies en overheidsinstrumenten te werken. Ik noem bijvoorbeeld de publieke omroep: het belang van pluraliteit van de pers en een goed evenwicht in de informatievoorziening kan vereisen dat er ook op langere termijn overheidsgeld in zo\u2019n sector gestoken wordt.\nVolkshuisvesting is een ander voorbeeld. Daar kan het ook zijn dat de belangen van stedenbouwkundige planning, het integreren van minderheden en sociale integratie in een stad vereisen dat je bepaalde spelers op de markt voorziet van overheidssteun om die ruimere doelstellingen te kunnen halen.\nDe laatste opmerking gaat over de Europese dimensie en de nationale dimensie. Daar zou ik erop willen wijzen, en dat heeft de heer H\u00f6kmark in het verslag ook gedaan, op het feit dat staatssteun nog wel eens gebruikt wordt om beleidsconcurrentie tussen lidstaten te voeren en ik zou de Commissie willen vragen daarop te letten, daar vanuit de Commissie sterker op toe te zien en ook op het gebied van sanctionering te kijken of de lidstaten zelf op dit punt niet aangepakt moeten worden en niet alleen de bedrijven waar de steun naartoe gaat.", "reconstructed_position": "<think>\nOkay, let's see.

If we take Gothenburg seriously, it makes sound business sense to rely on the equilateral triangle between economic, social and environmental development, but the statement is flawed in economic terms.\nIf Mr H\u00f6kmark \u2013 as he himself is right to say \u2013 wants small and medium-sized enterprises to be efficient and innovation to be driven forward, above all by subsidy, then what is needed alongside that is good training, good education, and the right infrastructure \u2013 not just in the great conurbations, but also, of course, in rural areas. He is therefore forced back onto the need for territorial, social and environmental cohesion.\nIf not, the simple fact is that people who live in places without these favourable and natural conditions are put at a disadvantage. That being so, I do indeed urge that a great deal of care be taken when considering where aid is to be applied, and it also has to be considered whether services in the public interest benefit from it, or else there is no point to it.\nIn one respect, I can tell Mr H\u00f6kmark that he is absolutely right. He writes that it makes no sense to give aid to businesses that are already profitable, and in that I agree with him.\nWhen I say that that sort of aid is wrong, I am thinking of the Federal Republic of Germany and of the highly-profitable motor industry into which money is shovelled, only for the firms to then close down and take production elsewhere with the help of more subsidies. That cannot be what aid is for. In that respect, Mr\u00a0H\u00f6kmark, you have got it absolutely right.\nThere are a whole load of models that we have to change. The de minimis threshold is the right one. It is indeed the case that regional aid is needed for the more backward regions in particular, and it cannot be denied that aid under Article 87 will continue to be needed for those regions currently affected by the statistical effect.", "lang": "DE", "original": "Helmuth Markov (GUE/NGL). \u2013 Herr Pr\u00e4sident, Frau Kommissarin, Herr Berichterstatter!

I agree that the administrative aspects of the procedure ought to be simplified, too. I strongly agree that we should increase the transparency of assistance. I also agree that a clearer regulation should be developed, especially in the area of public services. Transparency is also needed to make it clear who may be granted government assistance. Therefore the provision of assistance should be accompanied by the publication of a detailed list of those who are granted assistance, specifying the amounts received by each of them, especially in the case of agricultural allocations.\nHowever, I would like to call attention to the fact that while, on the one hand, I agree that there should not be any discrimination between regions or countries as regards assistance, on the other hand we must acknowledge that there are significantly underdeveloped countries and regions within the internal market. However, these countries \u2013 precisely in the interest of deepening the internal market \u2013 need a longer period of adaptation. It would not be fortunate if the debate on government assistance provided an opportunity for political attacks against the new Member States. These new Member States have already reduced their assistance significantly. These levels of assistance are not outstanding even when compared to their GDP, and they are lower than those of the more developed Member States in the most relevant comparison terms of euro/capita. This must also be taken into consideration when new Member States are accused in other areas, for instance of tax dumping. Also, it would not be fortunate if someone were to make a connection between government and European Union assistance and the delocation of companies, especially when new Member States are still in a negative transition period as regards structural funds or direct payments.\nApart from defined regional assistance, the aim is indeed to assist investments that create jobs in underdeveloped, competitively disadvantaged regions. We are not aiming at introducing an approach that would drive investors away from the European Union.

I too wish to join my colleagues in thanking Mr\u00a0H\u00f6kmark for all the excellent work he has done to enable this report to be finalised today. The subject of State aid is one on which there is definitely a lot of room for discussion. This is because it directly concerns all 25 Member States. It is good to ask where we want the reform to take us and to see what has led to the need for this kind of reform. When the preliminary decisions taken by the Commission between February 2004 and the present day are examined thoroughly and compared with the Lisbon Strategy and the conclusions of the 2002 Barcelona European Summit, it is evident that it would be much more productive if State aid were more direct and designed to meet these same objectives. Thus, I think that we should work towards having a system that is as simple as possible and, therefore, more effective and more transparent. This will be an indispensable instrument because it will eliminate unnecessary bureaucracy that, until now, has not only led to more money being wasted but has prevented State aid from bringing about progress and made it less suited to the purpose for which it was intended. We need better to protect the use of State aid so that funds are delivered to where they are needed and not, as previously used to happen, squandered to no good purpose. We have to reach a position where the State has clear aims, involving the proportionality principle, concerning where it wants to use its aid. We must not forget that these funds are subsidised by all taxpayers, so we want them to be used wisely and responsibly so that they are more productive and their effects still more keenly felt. We must not forget companies that have logistical problems as a result of being based in disadvantaged regions, for example companies on an island such as Gozo.

As we heard, this House, in an own-initiative report a few weeks ago, spoke out in favour of State aid for disadvantaged regions being continued until 2013. As the support businesses get from State aid is among the factors that influence them when making decisions about investment in a given area, it has an essential contribution to make to economic growth and the creation of jobs in that area. The EC Treaty includes a fundamental prohibition of State aid where it has a detrimental effect on the internal market by potentially distorting competition, but an exception is made for certain types of State aid, such as that given to promote the economic development of Europe\u2019s disadvantaged regions. As a member of the Committee for Regional Development, I am firmly of the conviction that direct State aid has a key role to play in regional development and plays an important part in achieving our primary cohesion goals.\nThe scope given to aid by Article 87(3)(a) of the EC Treaty in conjunction with the guidelines for regional aid have, in the past, enabled the regions concerned to attract businesses and thereby actively contribute to their own regeneration. Were such support is no longer possible, these regions\u2019 convergence process would be jeopardised by the lack of any competitive advantage against not only regions without developmental disadvantages but also regions in the new Member States in receipt of the maximum amounts of aid. This is particularly the case for regions bordering on the new Member States.\nThe reduction of bureaucracy is an important part of the law on aid and, like the increase in de minimis aid, makes an important contribution to making the legal environment more welcoming to businesses.", "lang": "DE", "original": "Rolf Berend (PPE-DE). \u2013 Herr Pr\u00e4sident, Frau Kommissarin, verehrte Kolleginnen und Kollegen!

Das Europ\u00e4ische Parlament hat sich \u2013 wie wir h\u00f6rten \u2013 vor wenigen Wochen in einem Initiativbericht klar f\u00fcr die Fortsetzung staatlicher Beihilfen f\u00fcr die benachteiligten Regionen bis 2013 ausgesprochen. Die Unterst\u00fctzung von Unternehmen durch staatliche Beihilfen ist einer der Faktoren, der die Entscheidung von Unternehmen zur Investition in einem bestimmten Gebiet beeinflusst und somit wesentlich zum Wirtschaftswachstum und zur Schaffung von Arbeitspl\u00e4tzen in diesem Gebiet beitr\u00e4gt. Grunds\u00e4tzlich sind nach dem EG-Vertrag staatliche Beihilfen nicht erlaubt, sofern sie sich nachteilig auf den Binnenmarkt auswirken, da sie zur Verz\u00f6gerung des Wettbewerbs f\u00fchren k\u00f6nnen. Bestimmte staatliche Beihilfen f\u00fcr spezielle Zwecke sind jedoch von diesem Grundsatz ausgenommen, etwa solche zur F\u00f6rderung der wirtschaftlichen Entwicklung benachteiligter Regionen in Europa. Als Mitglied des Ausschusses f\u00fcr regionale Entwicklung bin ich der festen \u00dcberzeugung, dass die staatlichen Direktbeihilfen in ihrer Schl\u00fcsselfunktion als Instrument der regionalen Entwicklung ein wichtiges Mittel zur Erreichung vorrangiger Koh\u00e4sionsziele sind.\nDie beihilferechtlichen Spielr\u00e4ume, wie sie sich aus Artikel 87 Absatz 3 Buchstabe\u00a0a EG-Vertrag in Verbindung mit den Leitlinien f\u00fcr die Regionalbeihilfen ergeben, haben es den betroffenen Regionen in der Vergangenheit erm\u00f6glicht, den Aufholprozess durch die Ansiedlung von Unternehmen aktiv zu gestalten. Bei einem Verlust dieser F\u00f6rderm\u00f6glichkeiten w\u00e4re der Konvergenzprozess dieser Regionen aufgrund des fehlenden Wettbewerbsvorteils gegen\u00fcber Regionen ohne Entwicklungsr\u00fcckstand auf der einen Seite und gegen\u00fcber F\u00f6rderh\u00f6chstgebieten in den neuen Mitgliedstaaten auf der anderen Seite gef\u00e4hrdet.

Das Europ\u00e4ische Parlament hat sich \u2013 wie wir h\u00f6rten \u2013 vor wenigen Wochen in einem Initiativbericht klar f\u00fcr die Fortsetzung staatlicher Beihilfen f\u00fcr die benachteiligten Regionen bis 2013 ausgesprochen. Die Unterst\u00fctzung von Unternehmen durch staatliche Beihilfen ist einer der Faktoren, der die Entscheidung von Unternehmen zur Investition in einem bestimmten Gebiet beeinflusst und somit wesentlich zum Wirtschaftswachstum und zur Schaffung von Arbeitspl\u00e4tzen in diesem Gebiet beitr\u00e4gt. Grunds\u00e4tzlich sind nach dem EG-Vertrag staatliche Beihilfen nicht erlaubt, sofern sie sich nachteilig auf den Binnenmarkt auswirken, da sie zur Verz\u00f6gerung des Wettbewerbs f\u00fchren k\u00f6nnen. Bestimmte staatliche Beihilfen f\u00fcr spezielle Zwecke sind jedoch von diesem Grundsatz ausgenommen, etwa solche zur F\u00f6rderung der wirtschaftlichen Entwicklung benachteiligter Regionen in Europa. Als Mitglied des Ausschusses f\u00fcr regionale Entwicklung bin ich der festen \u00dcberzeugung, dass die staatlichen Direktbeihilfen in ihrer Schl\u00fcsselfunktion als Instrument der regionalen Entwicklung ein wichtiges Mittel zur Erreichung vorrangiger Koh\u00e4sionsziele sind.\nDie beihilferechtlichen Spielr\u00e4ume, wie sie sich aus Artikel 87 Absatz 3 Buchstabe\u00a0a EG-Vertrag in Verbindung mit den Leitlinien f\u00fcr die Regionalbeihilfen ergeben, haben es den betroffenen Regionen in der Vergangenheit erm\u00f6glicht, den Aufholprozess durch die Ansiedlung von Unternehmen aktiv zu gestalten. Bei einem Verlust dieser F\u00f6rderm\u00f6glichkeiten w\u00e4re der Konvergenzprozess dieser Regionen aufgrund des fehlenden Wettbewerbsvorteils gegen\u00fcber Regionen ohne Entwicklungsr\u00fcckstand auf der einen Seite und gegen\u00fcber F\u00f6rderh\u00f6chstgebieten in den neuen Mitgliedstaaten auf der anderen Seite gef\u00e4hrdet.

The user provided a detailed debate summary about State Aid Reform from 2006 and wants the main points from Rolf Berend (PPE-DE). First, I need to go through the summary carefully.\n\nLooking at the executive summary, the core positions and arguments are listed under the Rapporteur's Framework, Commission Support, Key Areas of Contention, etc. The user specified Rolf Berend from PPE-DE. Wait, in the debate summary, the rapporteur is Gunnar H\u00f6kmark (PPE-DE), not Rolf Berend.

Rolf Berend isn't mentioned anywhere. The user might have a typo or confused the names. But assuming the user is correct, maybe Rolf Berend is another speaker not listed here?

Sadly, that was a one-sided and distorted outlook, which often meant that less of that rightful public support went to strategic economic sectors, such as research and innovation, or to the vital cohesion policy. In contrast, the Barroso Commission seems to take a different view, and the resolution approved by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs provides some guidelines from which the Commission ought not to deviate.\nNone of us opposes competition. Nevertheless, this basic value in the market economy has often been subject to the ideologies of bureaucrats and economists lacking in any political responsibility, to the extent that, in the real economy, they have been responsible for delaying the recovery of competitiveness in entire regions of the European Union.\nAs Mr\u00a0Pittella has already stated, we must start a new chapter today by reconciling competition with cohesion policies. To this end, advantageous tax conditions, for instance, are useful because they can contribute positively to the cohesion policies and because, in the absence of any tax harmonisation among the Member States, they constitute a vital instrument in the hands of national governments where tackling regional underdevelopment is concerned.\nI therefore want to make just one recommendation to Mrs\u00a0Kroes: that she drafts a new proposal for a directive as quickly as possible. This proposal should \u2013 if not exclusively, then mainly \u2013 take account of Parliament\u2019s guidelines, given that the crisis the Union is grappling with is completely subsumed by the Council\u2019s crisis and by its inability, for example, to deal with the unequal way in which the Member States\u2019 markets are deregulated, a situation that is far more damaging to competition than any misguided State aid is.", "lang": "IT", "original": "Paolo Cirino Pomicino (PPE-DE). \u2013 Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, signora Commissario, la proposta di risoluzione in esame \u00e8 un punto di saggio equilibrio \u2013 come saggio \u00e8 il nostro relatore \u2013 tra opinioni diverse e coglie un\u2019esigenza profonda dell\u2019Unione europea, da troppo tempo ferma al palo di una crescita bassa e poco competitiva.\nLa Commissione Prodi ha sempre guardato agli aiuti di Stato come a un nemico della concorrenza e del mercato unico.

It is more that we try to give a hook to Member States\u2019 companies, because the aid does not go to the Member States themselves. Via State aid, the Member State gives a hook to those who need a bit of help, instead of just giving them the fish. They want to do it themselves, but they need a little bit of backing.\nMrs in\u2018t Veld and other Members have talked about less and better State aid. She mentioned that that statement by the Commission is appropriate advice, in the opinion of her political group and her personal opinion. I would have been pleased to say that it was my wording, but we got it from the Council. Aid should be less and better. That is what we tried to indicate and that is what the rapporteur put in his report. State aid reform has to be shaped to deliver not only on growth, innovation and employment, but also on a wide range of primarily non-economic issues. We all agree that they are of fundamental importance to our social European model. These include the social and regional cohesion, human capital and cultural diversity rightly mentioned by Mrs van den Burg. However, State aid should be used wisely, because it is taxpayers\u2019 money. We should not compete through State aid by the Member States, because that is the wrong route. It would have a very detrimental effect. We must not allow a subsidy race between the Member States, so there is clearly a need for less aid, and aid that is better targeted.\nOn the specific concerns raised here today, the Commission will do its utmost to improve how the rules work in practice. It will also step up transparency, rightly called for by a number of Members. Aid should be monitored, but in the end it is only through a positive partnership that we will be able to deliver successful State aid reform.\nA couple of Members touched upon the role of the regional aid guidelines and focusing aid on the regions most in need. We discussed this before and it was adopted last year. Again that is not dogmatic, but it takes account of the fact that some need more backing at a particular moment. We want to deliver a fair and balanced package and we discussed that here in December.\nWe will look further at how the State aid rules can be adapted to new financing mechanisms such as public-private partnerships. The same goes for aid for projects of common interest to boost competitiveness and technological innovation. The question of innovation has been raised. I have just read an article by Professor Getz, saying that innovation should not just be developed in the research and development department of a company, it should be at all levels, from bottom to top. That is an interesting philosophy that could be considered when we are talking about how to boost innovation.\nTurning to SMEs, when we look at the 25 Member States, 92% of all the enterprises in the European Union are in the category of small and medium-sized enterprises. So when we talk about creating jobs and economic growth, we have to bear in mind that the vast majority fall within the category of small and medium-sized enterprises. That is what we are trying to take into account when we talk about giving them more attention than they have received up to now and to stimulate innovation and cooperation between, sometimes, a combination of research institutes, smaller companies and larger companies. It is a challenge to ensure that all those SMEs can take advantage of these opportunities.\nIt has rightly been mentioned that risk capital is not very developed in Europe. Compared to the United States, quite often innovative ideas are not taken up by companies that are small or just starting up because there is no backing from the banks. State aid to back those companies in their early development could be very helpful.\nMr Wortmann-Kool asked whether the Commission could raise the threshold. I am not saying that we would not be prepared to raise it. However, we should bear in mind that we are talking about SMEs and not large companies, and we should try to reduce bureaucracy and red tape. The amount of euros we are talking about really covers that category. So we shall be submitting a proposal quite soon, but do not be too optimistic, because I have heard on the grapevine that people are thinking of huge sums of money, but then we are not taking account of the category.\nOn the environment, the Commission cannot refuse to approve aid just because the objective pursued is not environmental. I am sure that is not the question that is being asked. We have to look at all the policies of the Union. However, the Commission shares the aim of reducing environmentally damaging State aid and we should all encourage Member States to take that into account when deciding on the subsidy.\nOn public services, services of general economic interest, the Commission\u2019s decision and framework makes clear how the State aid rules apply to public service compensation. The Commission is committed to reporting on the impact of those rules within the deadlines set by those instruments. As you know, the Commission does not consider a framework directive necessary. I am talking about less bureaucracy. I am being consistent and not saying that we should still do it when it is not necessary.\nFinally, the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs have done a great deal of work on this report and I am grateful that we can have a discussion with the same goal, i.e. more jobs for Europe, in a social context that we are proud to be living in.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Neelie Kroes, Member of the Commission .

Mr President, I count my blessings tonight. I conclude that there is not that much difference between political views on this issue. I congratulate the rapporteur. The content of the report and the Commission review are in line with what we discussed during this debate.\nI should like to underline that there is no rigid dogma. That was made clear on your side. It is more that we try to give a hook to Member States\u2019 companies, because the aid does not go to the Member States themselves. Via State aid, the Member State gives a hook to those who need a bit of help, instead of just giving them the fish. They want to do it themselves, but they need a little bit of backing.\nMrs in\u2018t Veld and other Members have talked about less and better State aid. She mentioned that that statement by the Commission is appropriate advice, in the opinion of her political group and her personal opinion. I would have been pleased to say that it was my wording, but we got it from the Council. Aid should be less and better. That is what we tried to indicate and that is what the rapporteur put in his report. State aid reform has to be shaped to deliver not only on growth, innovation and employment, but also on a wide range of primarily non-economic issues. We all agree that they are of fundamental importance to our social European model. These include the social and regional cohesion, human capital and cultural diversity rightly mentioned by Mrs van den Burg. However, State aid should be used wisely, because it is taxpayers\u2019 money. We should not compete through State aid by the Member States, because that is the wrong route. It would have a very detrimental effect. We must not allow a subsidy race between the Member States, so there is clearly a need for less aid, and aid that is better targeted.\nOn the specific concerns raised here today, the Commission will do its utmost to improve how the rules work in practice. It will also step up transparency, rightly called for by a number of Members. Aid should be monitored, but in the end it is only through a positive partnership that we will be able to deliver successful State aid reform.\nA couple of Members touched upon the role of the regional aid guidelines and focusing aid on the regions most in need. We discussed this before and it was adopted last year. Again that is not dogmatic, but it takes account of the fact that some need more backing at a particular moment. We want to deliver a fair and balanced package and we discussed that here in December.\nWe will look further at how the State aid rules can be adapted to new financing mechanisms such as public-private partnerships. The same goes for aid for projects of common interest to boost competitiveness and technological innovation. The question of innovation has been raised. I have just read an article by Professor Getz, saying that innovation should not just be developed in the research and development department of a company, it should be at all levels, from bottom to top. That is an interesting philosophy that could be considered when we are talking about how to boost innovation.\nTurning to SMEs, when we look at the 25 Member States, 92% of all the enterprises in the European Union are in the category of small and medium-sized enterprises. So when we talk about creating jobs and economic growth, we have to bear in mind that the vast majority fall within the category of small and medium-sized enterprises. That is what we are trying to take into account when we talk about giving them more attention than they have received up to now and to stimulate innovation and cooperation between, sometimes, a combination of research institutes, smaller companies and larger companies. It is a challenge to ensure that all those SMEs can take advantage of these opportunities.\nIt has rightly been mentioned that risk capital is not very developed in Europe. Compared to the United States, quite often innovative ideas are not taken up by companies that are small or just starting up because there is no backing from the banks. State aid to back those companies in their early development could be very helpful.\nMr Wortmann-Kool asked whether the Commission could raise the threshold. I am not saying that we would not be prepared to raise it. However, we should bear in mind that we are talking about SMEs and not large companies, and we should try to reduce bureaucracy and red tape. The amount of euros we are talking about really covers that category. So we shall be submitting a proposal quite soon, but do not be too optimistic, because I have heard on the grapevine that people are thinking of huge sums of money, but then we are not taking account of the category.\nOn the environment, the Commission cannot refuse to approve aid just because the objective pursued is not environmental. I am sure that is not the question that is being asked. We have to look at all the policies of the Union. However, the Commission shares the aim of reducing environmentally damaging State aid and we should all encourage Member States to take that into account when deciding on the subsidy.\nOn public services, services of general economic interest, the Commission\u2019s decision and framework makes clear how the State aid rules apply to public service compensation. The Commission is committed to reporting on the impact of those rules within the deadlines set by those instruments. As you know, the Commission does not consider a framework directive necessary. I am talking about less bureaucracy. I am being consistent and not saying that we should still do it when it is not necessary.\nFinally, the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs have done a great deal of work on this report and I am grateful that we can have a discussion with the same goal, i.e. more jobs for Europe, in a social context that we are proud to be living in.", "reconstructed_position": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out the main points Neelie Kroes made during the debate. Let me start by looking at the debate summary provided. The user mentioned that the answer should only include arguments attributed to the specified speaker, which in this case is Neelie Kroes.\n\nFrom the summary, there's a section titled \"Commission Support\" where Neelie Kroes is mentioned. The key quotes here are her endorsement of the reform agenda, the \"less and better\" approach, and her warning against a subsidy race between Member States. She also uses the metaphor about giving a hook instead of just the fish. \n\nI need to make sure I don't include any other speakers' points. The user emphasized that contributions from others shouldn't be included. So, focusing solely on Kroes's statements. \n\nHer main arguments seem to be about using State aid wisely, avoiding a subsidy race, and the idea that aid should be targeted to those who need help without distorting the market. The \"less and better\" approach is central here. Also, the metaphor about the hook versus giving the fish is important as it illustrates her stance on providing support that encourages self-sufficiency rather than dependency.\n\nI should structure the answer to list these points clearly, using the exact quotes from the summary. Since the user wants the main points or arguments made by the speaker, I need to present them concisely without any extra information. Let me check if there are any other mentions of Kroes in the summary. The rest of the sections discuss other speakers, so I can ignore those. \n\nYes, the only relevant part is the \"Commission Support\" section. So the answer should include her support for the reform, the \"less and better\" approach, the warning against subsidy races, and the hook metaphor. That's it. No other points from other speakers.\n</think>\n\nNeelie Kroes emphasized the Commission's support for the reform agenda, advocating for a \"less and better\" approach to State aid.

The user provided a detailed summary of a parliamentary debate about State aid reform, and they want me to outline the main points made by the speaker named \"President.\" But wait, in the debate summary, the speaker mentioned is \"President.\" However, looking through the provided executive summary, the main speakers mentioned are Gunnar H\u00f6kmark, Neelie Kroes, Gilles Savary, Sophia in 't Veld, Milo\u0161 Koterec, James Hugh Allister, Elisabeth Schroedter, Diamanto Manolakou, Graham Booth, and Jos\u00e9 Manuel Garc\u00eda-Margallo y Marfil. There's no mention of a \"President\" as a speaker in the contributions. \n\nThe user's instruction says that if there are no points attributed to the speaker, I should respond with an empty string. Since the summary doesn't list the President as a speaker, the answer should be empty. But maybe I should double-check to make sure I didn't miss any part of the summary where the President is mentioned. Let me scan through again.\n\nLooking at the sections: the debate information mentions the rapporteur and the Commission, but the actual speakers listed in the core positions and arguments are the ones I mentioned earlier. The \"President\" might refer to the President of the Parliament, but in the summary, there's no direct quote or contribution from the President. The summary starts with the debate information, then the executive summary, core positions, key areas of contention, opposition voices, key proposals, and conclusion.
