{"speaker": "Jonas Sj\u00f6stedt,", "english": "Jonas Sj\u00f6stedt, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group . \u2013 (SV) Mr President, twenty years have passed since the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl. Even today, 20 years after the event, we can see the appalling consequences. We can see these consequences in the form of the illnesses and disablement of thousands of people. We can see them in the form of enormous areas of land that are uninhabitable and that will be so for many generations to come. Even in my own little corner of Europe, in the north of Sweden, the radioactive fallout had an impact over many years through the contamination of the natural world that it caused.\nThe Chernobyl disaster is the worst nuclear accident that we have had, but we must not forget that it is not the only one. Do not forget Three Mile Island and all the other near-accidents that have occurred in the history of the nuclear industry. Nuclear power is not safe.\nOver the last 20 years there have been very few new nuclear reactors built in Europe. This means that we have a lot of aged reactors that continue to be in full operation. Aged reactors are dangerous reactors. It is time to plan seriously to decommission these older nuclear reactors.\nThe Chernobyl disaster is a reminder of the risks of nuclear power. To this should be added the fact that the issue of nuclear waste has still not been resolved. We are today producing nuclear waste that we still do not know how we are to store. We are leaving it up to future generations. Nuclear power has also proved to be a very expensive source of energy. This does not just mean that production costs are high but also that there are very high costs for dealing with retired reactors and the waste that is produced.\nLast but not least, nuclear power is a finite resource. The fuel will run out one day. We are currently on the brink of an enormous change\u2013over of energy sources. It is absolutely imperative that we phase out our dependence on oil and fossil fuels. The primary reason for this is not the price of oil but the greenhouse effect. It would be a fateful mistake to replace dependence on oil with a new and even greater dependence on nuclear power. Instead of this, we have before us a unique opportunity to develop durable, renewable \u2018green alternatives\u2019. We also need to dramatically reduce our dependence on energy. This is the conviction of the majority of the left in Europe.\nThe EU must, however, play its part in all of this. More of the EU\u2019s research money needs, then, to be spent on sources of renewable energy, and less on research into nuclear power, and the current EURATOM Treaty, which has been outdated for a number of years, needs to be repealed. Only when we have abolished nuclear power will the risks of new Chernobyl disasters be done away with.\n(Applause)", "lang": "SV", "original": "Jonas Sj\u00f6stedt, f\u00f6r GUE/NGL-gruppen . \u2013 Herr talman! Det har g\u00e5tt 20 \u00e5r sedan k\u00e4rnkraftskatastrofen i Tjernobyl. Fortfarande, 20 \u00e5r senare, kan vi se de ohyggliga konsekvenserna. Vi kan se dem i form av sjukdomar och handikapp f\u00f6r tusentals m\u00e4nniskor. Vi kan se dem i form av gigantiska landomr\u00e5den som \u00e4r obeboeliga, och som kommer att vara det i m\u00e5nga generationer fram\u00f6ver. Till och med i mitt lilla h\u00f6rn av Europa, i norra Sverige, fick det radioaktiva nedfallet konsekvenser under m\u00e5nga \u00e5r genom den f\u00f6rgiftning av naturen som det medf\u00f6rde.\nTjernobylolyckan \u00e4r den v\u00e4rsta k\u00e4rnkraftsolycka som vi har haft, men vi f\u00e5r inte gl\u00f6mma att det inte \u00e4r den enda. Kom ih\u00e5g Harrisburg! Kom ih\u00e5g alla de andra olyckstillbuden som har intr\u00e4ffat under k\u00e4rnkraftsindustrins historia! K\u00e4rnkraften \u00e4r inte s\u00e4ker.\nUnder de senaste 20 \u00e5ren har det byggts mycket f\u00e5 nya k\u00e4rnkraftsreaktorer i Europa. Det inneb\u00e4r att vi har m\u00e5nga gamla reaktorer som fortfarande g\u00e5r f\u00f6r fullt. Gamla reaktorer \u00e4r farliga reaktorer. Det \u00e4r dags att p\u00e5 allvar planera f\u00f6r att avveckla dessa \u00e4ldre k\u00e4rnkraftsreaktorer.\nTjernobylkatastrofen \u00e4r en p\u00e5minnelse om k\u00e4rnkraftens risker. Till det skall vi l\u00e4gga att avfallsfr\u00e5gan \u00e4nnu inte \u00e4r l\u00f6st. Vi producerar idag avfall som vi fortfarande inte vet hur vi skall f\u00f6rvara. Vi l\u00e4mnar det till kommande generationer. K\u00e4rnkraften har ocks\u00e5 visat sig vara en mycket dyrbar energik\u00e4lla. Den inneb\u00e4r inte bara h\u00f6ga produktionskostnader utan ocks\u00e5 mycket h\u00f6ga kostnader f\u00f6r att ta hand om uttj\u00e4nta reaktorer och det avfall som bildas.\nSist men inte minst: K\u00e4rnkraften \u00e4r en \u00e4ndlig resurs. Br\u00e4nslet kommer att ta slut. Vi st\u00e5r nu inf\u00f6r en gigantisk energiomst\u00e4llning. Det \u00e4r helt n\u00f6dv\u00e4ndigt att avveckla beroendet av oljan och de fossila br\u00e4nslena, inte i f\u00f6rsta hand p\u00e5 grund av oljepriset utan p\u00e5 grund av v\u00e4xthuseffekten. Det vore ett \u00f6desdigert misstag att ers\u00e4tta oljeberoendet med ett nytt, \u00e4nnu st\u00f6rre beroende av k\u00e4rnkraft. Vi har i st\u00e4llet en unik m\u00f6jlighet att bygga h\u00e5llbara, f\u00f6rnybara \u201dgr\u00f6na alternativ\u201d. Det kr\u00e4vs ocks\u00e5 att vi dramatiskt minskar v\u00e5rt beroende av energi. Detta \u00e4r \u00f6vertygelsen hos majoriteten av Europas v\u00e4nster.\nAllt detta m\u00e5ste emellertid EU bidra till. D\u00e5 kr\u00e4vs att mer av EU:s forskningspengar g\u00e5r till f\u00f6rnybara energik\u00e4llor, att mindre g\u00e5r till k\u00e4rnkraftsforskningen. D\u00e5 kr\u00e4vs att Euratomf\u00f6rdraget, som har varit f\u00f6r\u00e5ldrat i m\u00e5nga \u00e5r, avvecklas som det ser ut idag. F\u00f6rst n\u00e4r vi har avvecklat k\u00e4rnkraften upph\u00f6r riskerna f\u00f6r nya Tjernobylkatastrofer.\n(Appl\u00e5der)", "agenda_item": "Twenty years after Chernobyl: Lessons for the future (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060426-ITEM-009", "intervention_id": "3-035", "summary_english": "{\n\"headline\": \"Nuclear Power Must Be Phased Out in Favor of Renewable Energy to Prevent Future Chernobyl Disasters\",\n\"issueSum\": \"The speaker addresses the ongoing consequences of Chernobyl 20 years later, including illnesses, uninhabitable land, and environmental contamination.
