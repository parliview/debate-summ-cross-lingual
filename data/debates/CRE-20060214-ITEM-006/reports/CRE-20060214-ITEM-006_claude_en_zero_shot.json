As our means to this end, we opted deliberately for a legislative own-initiative report, which is very seldom used and requires a qualified majority, and we did so in order that our initiative might carry a good deal more weight. The fact that our report was adopted in Committee unanimously but for a few abstentions shows that a wide range of Members from all the political families will call on the Commission to at last do something about this, and I use the words \u2018at last\u2019 in view of the fact that the Commission ought to have stirred itself into action as long ago as May 2004, when its communication on the share of renewable energy in the EU was presented. That communication made it quite clear that the predicted failure to achieve the goal of doubling the share of renewable energy in overall energy consumption by 2010 was, in essence, attributable to poor market penetration by renewable heating and cooling technologies.\nAt present, some 10% of heat is derived from renewable sources of energy such as solar thermal and geothermal energy and biomass \u2013 far less than half than what is potentially feasible in the medium or long term. Experts work on the assumption that it will, by 2020, be possible to derive at least 25% of the heat and cooling that we need from renewable energy resources, but those sources will be usable only if framework conditions change. The fact that the subsidies accorded by at least some Member States are dependent on their own budgets has, however, meant that development has not been really continuous but has been on a stop-start basis. What is needed is for broad market penetration to be brought about by a European framework directive.\nIt is not reasonable to prescribe a European support system, and nor have we done so. What shape support is to take is for the Member States to decide; what matters is that they should actually give some and that all barriers that hinder progress should be removed. That means that administrative obstacles must be done away with, that transparent rules on competence must apply and that procedures relating to applications for authorisation must be unambiguous and streamlined.\nWith this report, we urge the Commission to present a proposal for a directive obliging the Member States to legislate in favour of heating and cooling from renewable energy sources and also to draw up action plans for future development. The intention is that action should be taken on the basis of effective national goals and result in at least a twofold increase across the EU by 2020.\nMany people in the European Union, Commissioner, are waiting for the Commission to take action. They worry about the environment and our climate; among them are many small and medium-sized businesses with great potential for employment, who particularly want to make their contribution to the production of heat from the sun, the earth, and from biomass.\nWe were delighted to note that the biomass action plan included the announcement of the eventual production of a directive. I have since seen a preliminary draft of the Energy Green Paper, which has been floating around the corridors of Brussels, and was shocked to see that nowhere in it is there any reference to the need for new things to be done about heating. In this draft Green Paper, incredibly, there is scant reference to renewable energy sources at all.\nI hope that you, Commissioner Piebalgs, will be able to allay my concerns following the reading of this draft Green Paper, and also that you will again display the commitment to efficiency and renewable energies for which we know you. I hope that you announce that the Commission will, this year, produce a proposal for a directive on heating and cooling from renewable sources of energy.\n(Applause)", "lang": "DE", "original": "Mechtild Rothe (PSE), Berichterstatterin . \u2013 Herr Pr\u00e4sident, liebe Kolleginnen und Kollegen, Herr Kommissar Piebalgs! Das Europ\u00e4ische Parlament wird heute \u2013 davon k\u00f6nnen wir und Sie, Herr Kommissar ausgehen \u2013 mit gro\u00dfer Mehrheit die Kommission auffordern, einen Legislativvorschlag f\u00fcr das Heizen und K\u00fchlen mit erneuerbaren Energien vorzulegen. Bewusst haben wir das sehr selten genutzte Instrument des legislativen Initiativberichts gew\u00e4hlt, der eine qualifizierte Mehrheit erfordert. Wir haben es gew\u00e4hlt, um das Gewicht unserer Initiative deutlich zu erh\u00f6hen. Die einstimmige Annahme unseres Berichts mit wenigen Enthaltungen im Ausschuss zeigt, dass eine breite, fraktions\u00fcbergreifende Aufforderung an die Kommission geht, endlich aktiv zu werden. Ich sage endlich, weil schon die Vorlage der Kommissionsmitteilung vom Mai 2004 zum Anteil erneuerbarer Energien in der EU eigentlich ein T\u00e4tigwerden der Kommission notwendig gemacht h\u00e4tte. Die Mitteilung besagte ganz klar, dass das prognostizierte Nichterreichen des Ziels der Verdoppelung des Anteils erneuerbarer Energien am Gesamtenergieverbrauch bis 2010 im Wesentlichen auf die schlechte Marktdurchdringung von erneuerbaren W\u00e4rme- und K\u00e4ltetechnologien zur\u00fcckzuf\u00fchren ist.\nDerzeit haben die erneuerbaren Energien \u2013 also Solarthermie, Biomasse, Geothermie \u2013 einen ca. zehnprozentigen Anteil an der W\u00e4rmegewinnung. Das ist weit weniger als die H\u00e4lfte des mittel- bis langfristig nutzbaren Potenzials. Experten gehen davon aus, dass bis zum Jahre 2020 mindestens 25% des W\u00e4rme- und K\u00e4ltebedarfs aus erneuerbaren Energieressourcen gewonnen werden k\u00f6nnen. Aber sie werden nur aus erneuerbaren Energietr\u00e4gern gewonnen, wenn sich die Rahmenbedingungen ver\u00e4ndern. Die derzeit zumindest in einigen Mitgliedstaaten gew\u00e4hrten finanziellen Zusch\u00fcsse haben jedoch nur durch die jeweilige Haushaltsabh\u00e4ngigkeit zu Stop-and-go -Entwicklungen gef\u00fchrt, nicht zu einem wirklich kontinuierlichen Ausbau. Notwendig ist, dass durch eine europ\u00e4ische Rahmenrichtlinie eine breite Marktdurchdringung erreicht wird.\nEs ist nicht sinnvoll, ein europ\u00e4isches F\u00f6rdersystem vorzusehen. Das haben wir auch nicht getan. Die Art der F\u00f6rderung soll in der Entscheidung der Mitgliedstaaten liegen. Dass sie f\u00f6rdern und dass alle Barrieren, die den Ausbau behindern, beseitigt werden, ist entscheidend. So m\u00fcssen administrative Hindernisse abgebaut werden. Es m\u00fcssen transparente Zust\u00e4ndigkeitsregeln gelten und eindeutige und beschleunigte Genehmigungsverfahren bestehen.\nMit dem Bericht fordern wir die Kommission auf, einen Richtlinienvorschlag vorzulegen, der die Mitgliedstaaten verpflichtet, legislative Ma\u00dfnahmen f\u00fcr W\u00e4rme und K\u00e4lte aus erneuerbaren Energien zu ergreifen. Zudem sollen sie Aktionspl\u00e4ne f\u00fcr den Ausbau erstellen. Die Ma\u00dfnahmen sollen an effektiven nationalen Zielen orientiert sein und EU-weit mindestens eine Verdoppelung bis 2020 bringen.\nHerr Kommissar, viele in der Europ\u00e4ischen Union warten darauf, dass die Kommission t\u00e4tig wird. Das sind Menschen, die Sorgen um die Umwelt, um das Klima haben. Das sind viele Klein- und Mittelbetriebe, die ein gro\u00dfes Besch\u00e4ftigungspotenzial haben und es insbesondere im Bereich der W\u00e4rmegewinnung aus Sonne, Erdw\u00e4rme und Biomasse einbringen wollen.\nWir haben mit Freude zur Kenntnis genommen, dass im Biomasse-Aktionsplan die Vorlage einer Richtlinie angek\u00fcndigt wurde. Erschrocken war ich jetzt, als ich einen Vorentwurf zum Gr\u00fcnbuch Energieversorgung las, der durch die Br\u00fcsseler Flure geistert. An keiner Stelle wird dort die Notwendigkeit neuer Aktivit\u00e4ten im W\u00e4rmebereich erw\u00e4hnt. Insgesamt f\u00fchren die erneuerbaren Energien in diesem Entwurf eines Gr\u00fcnbuchs ein unglaubliches Schattendasein.\nHerr Kommissar Piebalgs, ich hoffe, dass Sie mir die Sorgen nehmen k\u00f6nnen, die ich nach dem Lesen dieses Entwurfs eines Gr\u00fcnbuchs hatte. Und ich hoffe, dass Sie Ihr Engagement im Bereich Effizienz und erneuerbare Energien, das wir von Ihnen gewohnt sind, auch hier wieder an den Tag legen. Ich hoffe, dass Sie heute ank\u00fcndigen, dass die Kommission in diesem Jahr einen Richtlinienvorschlag f\u00fcr den Bereich W\u00e4rme und K\u00e4lte aus erneuerbaren Energien vorlegen wird.\n(Beifall)", "agenda_item": "Heating and cooling from renewable energy sources (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060214-ITEM-006", "intervention_id": "2-058", "summary_english": "```json\n{\n  \"headline\": \"EU Must Act on Legislative Directive for Renewable Heating and Cooling to Achieve Climate Goals and Market Growth\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"The key issue raised is the EU's failure to achieve its goal of doubling renewable energy share by 2010, primarily due to poor market penetration of renewable heating and cooling technologies.

As you know, the Commission intends to adopt a Green Paper on a secure, sustainable and competitive energy policy on 8\u00a0March. Whatever you have seen to date, it is not the Green Paper. The Green Paper will be adopted on 8\u00a0March by the whole college, and there will be no backtracking from energy efficiency and from renewable energies.

We will strive to achieve a balanced approach, but that does not mean backtracking; that is clearly not the way we would like to present it. However, there is still some time before the Commission completes its work on this Green Paper.\nSince 1997, the European Union has been working towards the objective of 12% of renewable energy balance by 2010 but, to date, we have achieved only half of that goal.

There is broad support here in Parliament for what such a directive should contain. In accordance with the ambition stated in the Commission\u2019s 1997 White Paper for a Community Strategy and Action Plan, \u2018Energy for the future: renewable sources of energy\u2019, we are eager to supplement the two directives on the promotion of renewable energy sources in relation to, respectively, electricity and transport with a third directive, this time in relation to heating.\nOf Europe\u2019s total energy consumption, almost half goes on heating. Given today\u2019s warning signals concerning climate change and in view of the fact that we are so dependent on imports of traditional energy sources with consequent high carbon dioxide emissions, it is extremely important for us to exploit the huge potential for renewable energy sources in Europe, together with our existing resources in terms of such renewables. There are great benefits to be gained from increasing the proportion of these within the heating and cooling sector. Allow me to mention a few of them. We should reduce carbon dioxide emissions; we should reduce our dependency on imports and increase the degree to which we are self-sufficient in Europe; we should not be as easily affected by energy crises in other parts of the world; and, by promoting renewable energy sources, we should provide incentives for innovation and technical development within this area which, in turn, would lead to further cleaner and more efficient energy consumption. The fact that the choice of renewable energy source would be made in the light of each Member State\u2019s requirements would mean that we should be contributing to regional development. Moreover, we should be creating a lot of jobs, as this is one of the few spheres in which we are, in fact, clearly creating new jobs in Europe and are rightly heading in the direction of increased growth.\nThese are the needs and the benefits, but how do we meet these needs and obtain these benefits? I believe that nationally binding targets for the proportion of renewable energy is a first step, but it is not enough. I hope that the Commission will also create the basic conditions required if companies are to dare to make long-term investments in technology that will permit the increased use of renewable energy sources, and I call on it to do so. I also hope that the Commission will provide crucial research with the resources required for discovering and developing new technology and, again, I call on it to do so.\nFinally, I would draw attention to the technical solutions that already exist whereby we might obtain more efficient use of the energy we exploit to heat houses, namely district heating. Technical solutions and choices of energy source go hand in hand. Modern, technically advanced district heating is part of the solution, and it may also be combined with what is known as trigeneration electricity production.\nThis own-initiative report shows clearly and unambiguously what Parliament wants to see in terms of future draft legislation. I hope that the Commission will quickly follow up this initiative so that we lose no time in obtaining the incentives needed for changing over to using an ever higher proportion of renewable energy sources for heating Europe or cooling it down.\nAs Einstein once said, a whole new way of thinking is required for solving the problems we have created through our old way of thinking.

There is broad support here in Parliament for what such a directive should contain. In accordance with the ambition stated in the Commission\u2019s 1997 White Paper for a Community Strategy and Action Plan, \u2018Energy for the future: renewable sources of energy\u2019, we are eager to supplement the two directives on the promotion of renewable energy sources in relation to, respectively, electricity and transport with a third directive, this time in relation to heating.\nOf Europe\u2019s total energy consumption, almost half goes on heating. Given today\u2019s warning signals concerning climate change and in view of the fact that we are so dependent on imports of traditional energy sources with consequent high carbon dioxide emissions, it is extremely important for us to exploit the huge potential for renewable energy sources in Europe, together with our existing resources in terms of such renewables. There are great benefits to be gained from increasing the proportion of these within the heating and cooling sector. Allow me to mention a few of them. We should reduce carbon dioxide emissions; we should reduce our dependency on imports and increase the degree to which we are self-sufficient in Europe; we should not be as easily affected by energy crises in other parts of the world; and, by promoting renewable energy sources, we should provide incentives for innovation and technical development within this area which, in turn, would lead to further cleaner and more efficient energy consumption. The fact that the choice of renewable energy source would be made in the light of each Member State\u2019s requirements would mean that we should be contributing to regional development. Moreover, we should be creating a lot of jobs, as this is one of the few spheres in which we are, in fact, clearly creating new jobs in Europe and are rightly heading in the direction of increased growth.\nThese are the needs and the benefits, but how do we meet these needs and obtain these benefits? I believe that nationally binding targets for the proportion of renewable energy is a first step, but it is not enough. I hope that the Commission will also create the basic conditions required if companies are to dare to make long-term investments in technology that will permit the increased use of renewable energy sources, and I call on it to do so. I also hope that the Commission will provide crucial research with the resources required for discovering and developing new technology and, again, I call on it to do so.\nFinally, I would draw attention to the technical solutions that already exist whereby we might obtain more efficient use of the energy we exploit to heat houses, namely district heating. Technical solutions and choices of energy source go hand in hand. Modern, technically advanced district heating is part of the solution, and it may also be combined with what is known as trigeneration electricity production.\nThis own-initiative report shows clearly and unambiguously what Parliament wants to see in terms of future draft legislation. I hope that the Commission will quickly follow up this initiative so that we lose no time in obtaining the incentives needed for changing over to using an ever higher proportion of renewable energy sources for heating Europe or cooling it down.\nAs Einstein once said, a whole new way of thinking is required for solving the problems we have created through our old way of thinking. Parliament has made important efforts in this direction. We now hope that the Commission will complete the work."}, {"speaker": "Claude Turmes,", "english": "Claude Turmes, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . \u2013 (DE) Mr President, I have only a minute, so I will be brief.

Heating, cooling and the use of renewable energy are part of the broader issue of security of the European Union\u2019s energy supply. There is more to saving energy than protecting the environment. It also has a significant bearing on the economy and is linked to the development of renewable energy sources.\nThe importance of this problem has been highlighted by recent cases of energy terrorism. I refer to increasing the cost of fuel, with negative implications for the financial health of businesses and the citizens\u2019 standard of living. I should like to mention three concerns.\nFirstly, setting 2020 as the time period within which to implement programmes on energy saving suggests a static approach to the challenge. It fails to take account of activities on the global market, and amounts to inertia.\nSecondly, tax concessions and lower VAT rates should apply to all activities involving the use, exploitation and creation of new sources of renewable energy.\nThirdly, the use of currently unexploited agricultural land for the production of biomass and sustainable fuels should be speeded up. The regulation of agricultural production in the European Union comes into play here, together with the lack of appropriate subsidies for the production of vegetables and fruit, notably soft fruit.\nThe area of unexploited land is set to increase, leading to an increase in poverty and unemployment in rural areas. If the production of the biomass and fuels I mentioned is developed quickly, it will create employment and improve the security of energy supply for our countries."}, {"speaker": "Jan B\u0159ezina (PPE-DE). \u2013", "english": "Jan B\u0159ezina (PPE-DE). \u2013 ( CS ) Mr President, Commissioner, heating and cooling accounts for 49% of the energy consumed on our continent.

The less we use fossil fuels for these purposes the better, not only from the standpoint of global climate change, but also from the standpoint of reducing dependence on imports from outside Europe. The use of renewables also has a largely positive influence on the rural economy, which is where the new energy plants will be located, with the creation of new jobs.\nThis report, which the rapporteur has drawn up on the basis of detailed investigations and discussions, presents a whole raft of strategic measures that must be implemented if we are to overcome the obstacles to greater use of renewables. Speaking as an MEP from the Czech Republic, however, I must state that the position of renewables on the market weakened after accession to the EU because the mandatory bracketing of, for example, briquettes and pellets made from biomass into higher VAT bands led to a sharp decline in a market that had been showing promising signs of development.

I should like to thank both Mrs Hall for the valuable work she has done on this resolution, along with the other shadow rapporteurs, and the rapporteur herself, whose skilful mediation and collation work has led to a text that enjoys broad support in this Parliament.\nThe objective that the European Parliament is setting itself with this resolution is an ambitious one in my view. First of all, it is ambitious in its methods, because Parliament is taking a proactive role under the Rule 39 procedure and is calling on the Commission to put forward a legislative act that is needed to fill a gap, to put that missing piece in place in the structure of the legislative and legal framework. That will enable us to make significant progress towards the use of renewable energies, in particular for the heating and cooling sector.\nI think everyone is surprised to learn that 50% of Europe\u2019s energy requirements are used for heating. That reveals the obvious need for a legislative provision, without which the sector cannot grow \u2013 something that was also acknowledged by the Commission in its report on energy efficiency. The sector also needs to be given some certainty. Without the certainty of possible growth there will be no investment and no research; in short, there will not be that kind of concentration of resources and energies that will enable the sector to make a qualitative leap.\nSecondly, Parliament\u2019s objective is also important and ambitious in that it sets a deadline of 2020. Some may perhaps consider that deadline to be rather timid and limited, but I believe we should see it as a target to beat.\nCommissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when we talk about a share of over 20%, we are hoping to achieve a significant percentage, more than double the current share for renewable sources of energy.\nTo conclude, I believe that there is a clear commitment in Parliament and from certain Members \u2013 I see Vittorio Prodi is here for the subject of biomass.

First of all, it is ambitious in its methods, because Parliament is taking a proactive role under the Rule 39 procedure and is calling on the Commission to put forward a legislative act that is needed to fill a gap, to put that missing piece in place in the structure of the legislative and legal framework.

Heat and cooling networks and biomass, particularly woody biomass, are important outlets for the timber industry, fit in perfectly with a sustainable European forestry strategy and can support European efforts towards sustainable development, particularly the aim of 12% of all energy consumed being from renewable sources by 2010. However, there is currently no legislation governing the use of renewable energy for heating and cooling, and this gap must be filled following the publication of the European Commission's biomass action plan on 7\u00a0December last year.\nI would like to emphasise three points that I see as important. First of all, on 28\u00a0January, the Ecofin Council concluded a political agreement to extend the experimental reduced VAT rate on labour-intensive services until 2010. The important new aspect for the subject we are now discussing is the inclusion of district heating in the option provided for in Article\u00a012(3)(b) of the sixth VAT Directive, under the same heading as the supply of natural gas and electricity. The Member States can therefore now put an end to this disparity in the tax treatment of sales of heating energy and subscriptions to heat and cooling networks using renewable energy, and the supply of natural gas and electricity.\nI fully support the rapporteur's recommendation regarding the use of the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Funds and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD).", "lang": "FR", "original": "Bernadette Bourzai (PSE). - Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, chers coll\u00e8gues, je tiens d\u2019abord \u00e0 f\u00e9liciter Mechtild Rothe pour son excellent rapport d\u2019initiative qui demande clairement \u00e0 la Commission europ\u00e9enne d\u2019\u00e9laborer, avant juillet\u00a02006, une proposition l\u00e9gislative sur l\u2019accroissement de la part des \u00e9nergies renouvelables dans le domaine du chauffage et de la r\u00e9frig\u00e9ration.

Heat and cooling networks and biomass, particularly woody biomass, are important outlets for the timber industry, fit in perfectly with a sustainable European forestry strategy and can support European efforts towards sustainable development, particularly the aim of 12% of all energy consumed being from renewable sources by 2010. However, there is currently no legislation governing the use of renewable energy for heating and cooling, and this gap must be filled following the publication of the European Commission's biomass action plan on 7\u00a0December last year.\nI would like to emphasise three points that I see as important. First of all, on 28\u00a0January, the Ecofin Council concluded a political agreement to extend the experimental reduced VAT rate on labour-intensive services until 2010. The important new aspect for the subject we are now discussing is the inclusion of district heating in the option provided for in Article\u00a012(3)(b) of the sixth VAT Directive, under the same heading as the supply of natural gas and electricity.

Currently, only 10% of heating comes from renewable sources despite expert assessments that 25% could be feasible by 2020. The primary barriers identified include inconsistent national subsidies creating \"stop-and-go development,\" administrative obstacles, lack of legislative framework, and energy security concerns highlighted by recent Russian gas supply disruptions.\n\n### Positions and Arguments\n\n**Strong Pro-Legislative Action (Majority Position)**\n\nRapporteur Mechtild Rothe led the charge for immediate Commission action, arguing that \"the Commission ought to have stirred itself into action as long ago as May 2004\" when renewable energy shortfalls were first identified [Rothe, 2006-02-14]. She emphasized that \"what is needed is for broad market penetration to be brought about by a European framework directive\" [Rothe, 2006-02-14].\n\nCommissioner Andris Piebalgs supported this direction, committing that \"without a vigorous development of renewable energy in the sector of heating and cooling, the overall objective of 12% renewable energy by 2010 will not be achieved\" [Piebalgs, 2006-02-14]. He promised to \"work hard to table a legislative proposal as quickly as possible and certainly before the end of this year\" [Piebalgs, 2006-02-14].\n\n**Political Group Positions**\n\nThe PPE-DE Group, represented by Lambert van Nistelrooij, supported doubling renewable energy shares by 2020 but opposed \"overregulation and binding objectives at the present time,\" favoring \"effective national objectives combined with viable targets\" [van Nistelrooij, 2006-02-14].\n\nPSE Group members Reino Paasilinna and others strongly backed the framework directive, with Paasilinna warning that \"how will we be able to cope with a dependence rate of 70% in the year 2030?\" [Paasilinna, 2006-02-14].\n\nALDE Group's Lena Ek advocated for \"nationally binding targets for the proportion of renewable energy\" while emphasizing that this approach represents \"one of the few spheres in which we are, in fact, clearly creating new jobs in Europe\" [Ek, 2006-02-14].\n\n**Implementation Challenges and Solutions**\n\nSeveral speakers addressed practical implementation issues. Claude Turmes provided concrete examples, noting that in Upper Austria, oil heating installations dropped from 1,200 to just seven annually, replaced by biomass and pellet systems that \"created jobs in the forestry sector, in agriculture, and for local installing engineers\" [Turmes, 2006-02-14].\n\nJan B\u0159ezina highlighted VAT disparities affecting new Member States, where \"mandatory bracketing of briquettes and pellets made from biomass into higher VAT bands led to a sharp decline in a market that had been showing promising signs of development\" [B\u0159ezina, 2006-02-14].\n\n**Energy Security Arguments**\n\nMultiple speakers linked renewable heating and cooling to broader energy security concerns. Alejo Vidal-Quadras Roca argued that \"the European Union must act urgently\" given \"recent cuts in natural gas supply in Ukraine\" and oil prices oscillating between \"60 and 65 dollars\" per barrel [Vidal-Quadras Roca, 2006-02-14].\n\n**Cautionary Voices**\n\nHerbert Reul provided the most significant counterargument, warning against \"tunnel vision\" and arguing that renewable heating and cooling \"will not spare us the need to answer other questions, for example, to questions like, 'How do we handle nuclear power?'\" [Reul, 2006-02-14]. He criticized over-regulation, noting that \"42 directives have been adopted in the energy field alone, with 22 of them dealing with energy efficiency\" yet progress remains insufficient [Reul, 2006-02-14].\n\nVladim\u00edr Remek emphasized economic realities, stating that \"politicians talk more about the need to use renewables than those who take the real decisions in this area, that is to say the general public\" [Remek, 2006-02-14].\n\n### Key Proposals\n\nThe debate produced several concrete proposals:\n\n1. **Legislative Framework:** A European framework directive requiring Member States to establish national action plans with binding targets for at least doubling renewable heating and cooling by 2020\n\n2. **Administrative Reforms:** Streamlined approval procedures, transparent competence rules, and removal of bureaucratic barriers\n\n3. **Financial Incentives:** Lower VAT rates for renewable energy products, better use of EU Structural Funds, and addressing tax disparities between Member States\n\n4. **Technology Focus:** Emphasis on biomass, heat pumps, district heating systems, and solar thermal technologies\n\n5. **Building Efficiency:** Particular attention to renovating poor-quality housing blocks in Eastern European countries\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe debate demonstrated strong parliamentary consensus for EU action on renewable heating and cooling, with broad support for Commissioner Piebalgs' commitment to present legislation by end-2006. While disagreement exists on the degree of regulation versus subsidiarity, there was unanimous recognition that the current 10% renewable share in heating and cooling represents a significant untapped opportunity for achieving climate goals, energy security, and economic development. The success stories from countries like Austria and Denmark provided concrete evidence that rapid transformation is possible with appropriate policy frameworks.", "src_model": "claude", "model_type": "claude", "model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "structured": false, "incremental": false, "hierarchical": false, "grouped": false, "shuffle": false, "prompt": false, "lang": "english"}
