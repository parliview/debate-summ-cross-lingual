{"speaker": "Andris Piebalgs,", "english": "Andris Piebalgs, Member of the Commission . Mr President, I should like to thank you for the very interesting debate, and I also again thank the rapporteur, Mrs Rothe, and all the shadow rapporteurs, for their work. I know that you all feel passionately about this subject, and this is definitely not the only answer that we should be looking for in the energy sector. I am also passionate about this report. The vote in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and the debate today have demonstrated very impressive support for the ideas expressed in the report.\nI believe the Commission has already taken strong steps in this direction. In the Biomass Action Plan in December 2005 the Commission announced that it would work towards an initiative on heating and cooling from renewable energy sources. But at the same time, as some Members have indicated, we care about better legislation and delivering legislation that can be implemented properly and respect the principle of subsidiarity. That is why I have asked my services to deliver an impact assessment in this area, because it will also be very important later on in the debate to steer the proposal on the basis of a proper impact assessment. On the basis of this impact assessment, I will take a further decision on how to take this important subject further.\nHowever, at the same time I can tell you that the Commission will meet your expectations, as Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca mentioned, and we are working not only in this direction but also for the implementation of legislation. Today I am pleased to inform the Committee on Industry of exactly what we are doing in this respect. We have adopted the Biomass Action Plan that I have already mentioned, and recently we adopted the communication on biofuels. That shows that the Commission is very serious about achieving better penetration of renewable energies in a European energy mix.\nI thank you for your huge interest in this debate and I hope that by the end of this year I will be able to present a legislative proposal to this House.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Andris Piebalgs, Member of the Commission .
