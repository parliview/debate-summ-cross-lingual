{"speaker": "Vladim\u00edr Ma\u0148ka (PSE).", "english": "Vladim\u00edr Ma\u0148ka (PSE). \u2013 (SK) I would like to express my thanks to Mrs Rothe for her excellent report. There are only a\u00a0few regions in Europe that have formulated and implemented successful strategies for energy generation from renewable sources. Differences in development are not based on differences in opportunities but on political agendas. The only way forward is to set major targets jointly, I reiterate the word jointly, and to monitor their attainment.\nI\u00a0would like to emphasise that it is essential to offer incentives to investors who go down the road of renewable energy sources. One of the proposed incentives, also mentioned by my colleague, Mr B\u0159ezina, would be to offer a\u00a0lower VAT rate. It is a good incentive, but on the other hand it will not motivate countries with a flat-rate tax. I believe that the future of Europe will not move in the direction of the flat-rate tax. However, we need to take account of the fact that countries that have already implemented the flat-rate tax will not be willing to give it up.\nIn conclusion, allow me to provide an example. The city where I have held the office of mayor for the past seven years is generating 15% of its energy from renewable sources. Thanks in part to the Structural Funds, that proportion will reach 50% in two years\u2019 time, something for which I\u00a0would like express my gratitude.", "lang": "SK", "original": "Vladim\u00edr Ma\u0148ka (PSE). \u2013 Chcem sa po\u010fakova\u0165 pani Rothe za v\u00fdborn\u00fa spr\u00e1vu.
