Indeed it brings to the fore concern for the environment, the encouragement of innovation and the infrastructure that must facilitate competitiveness and independent growth in Europe.\nRenewable energy sources are the natural wealth of the European Union, reducing our dependence on imports and improving our environment. At the same time their use increases the diversity of energy sources, and improves the reliability of energy supply. We must exploit them not simply to produce electricity, but also for heating and cooling buildings, since that alone accounts for more than 40% of the use of all energy in Europe.\nA recent Eurobarometer survey showed that people support a common European energy policy. For this reason in Europe we must also formulate clear guidelines and incentives in the area of cooling and heating. We must set ourselves a common goal, but leave it to the Member States to formulate their own national goals, which should be rational and binding. Goals must be set relative to the natural features of individual countries, since they do not all enjoy the same conditions, for instance in the exploitation of solar energy or biomass.\nIn fact it is precisely with biomass that we should exercise particular caution over how to encourage its use. It is also a raw material for the wood processing industry, and serves to create numerous jobs and high added value. By using wood as a natural material, less energy is used in making the final product, while at the same time this reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and the wood retains the carbon dioxide, that has built up in the tree over a number of years.\nMay I close by pointing out that for energy purposes it is prudent to use only wood waste that is unsuitable for recycling, while the rest can be processed into useful raw materials. The European energy policy must also be formulated to accommodate this.", "lang": "SL", "original": "Romana Jordan Cizelj (PPE-DE). \u2013 Spodbujanje uporabe obnovljivih virov energije pomeni neposredno izvajanje ciljev lizbonske strategije. V ospredje namre\u010d postavlja skrb za okolje, vzpodbujanje inovativnosti ter infrastrukturo, ki mora omogo\u010dati konkuren\u010dnost oziroma neodvisno rast v Evropi.\nObnovljivi viri energije so naravno bogastvo Evropske unije, ki zmanj\u0161uje na\u0161o uvozno odvisnost in izbolj\u0161uje na\u0161e okolje. Prav tako se z njihovo uporabo ve\u010da pestrost virov energije ter izbolj\u0161uje zanesljivost oskrbe z energijo. Izkoristiti jih moramo ne le za proizvodnjo elektrike, marve\u010d tudi za ogrevanje in hlajenje stavb, saj le to predstavlja ve\u010d kot 40 % uporabe vse energije v Evropi.\nNedavna raziskava evrobarometra je pokazala, da ljudje podpirajo skupno evropsko energetsko politiko. Zato moramo v Evropi tudi na podro\u010dju hlajenja in ogrevanja oblikovati jasne usmeritve in spodbude. Zastaviti si moramo skupen cilj, a pustiti dr\u017eavam \u010dlanicam, da oblikujejo svoje nacionalne cilje, ki bi morali biti razumski in obvezujo\u010di. Cilji morajo biti zastavljeni glede na naravne danosti posameznih dr\u017eav, saj nimajo vse enakih pogojev, na primer za izrabo son\u010dne energije ali biomase.\nPrav pri biomasi moramo biti \u0161e posebej pazljivi, kako vzpodbujamo njeno uporabo. Le-ta je namre\u010d tudi surovina lesno-predelovalne industrije, ki z njo ustvarja \u0161tevilna delovna mesta in visoko dodano vrednost. Z uporabo lesa kot naravnega materiala se za izdelavo kon\u010dnega izdelka uporabi manj energije, hkrati to zni\u017euje izpuste toplogrednih plinov, les pa v sebi zadr\u017euje tudi ogljikov dioksid, ki se je nalagal v drevesu ve\u010d let.\nNaj zaklju\u010dim, da je za energetske namene modro uporabiti le lesne odpadke, ki so neprimerni za recikla\u017eo, ostale pa predelati v uporabne surovine.
