{"speaker": "Claude Turmes,", "english": "Claude Turmes, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . \u2013 (DE) Mr President, I have only a minute, so I will be brief. Many thanks, Mrs Rothe, you tireless campaigner, for this good piece of work. I would like to give an example of the potential involved here; in Upper Austria, 1\u00a0500 new houses are built every year. Ten years ago, 1\u00a0200 of them were fitted with oil heating. In Upper Austria this year, only seven were so equipped; all the others used biomass, networks or pellets instead for heating. That created jobs in the forestry sector, in agriculture, and for local installing engineers, so that today, indeed, oil merchants have gone over to selling pellets.\nThat is the way we must go, or, to put it another way, we have to take the good practice that is to be found at the local and regional levels, and put it to work across Europe. I might add that Denmark, too, has done exemplary work in this respect, an example that we in this House will, this afternoon, vote to follow. It will then be for you to put the work in.\nJust another thing on the subject of the Green Paper, Commissioner: if we are to win Europeans over, there needs to be a chapter in it with the title \u2018 Winning the hearts of Europeans, going on with renewals! \u2019 That is what the people of Europe expect of us, and you should not fall short of that standard.\n(Applause)", "lang": "DE", "original": "Claude Turmes, im Namen der Verts/ALE-Fraktion . \u2013 Herr Pr\u00e4sident! Ich habe nur eine Minute, also werde ich mich kurz fassen. Frau Rothe, unerm\u00fcdliche K\u00e4mpferin, vielen Dank f\u00fcr dieses gute Werk. Ich m\u00f6chte ein Beispiel f\u00fcr das Potenzial anf\u00fchren. In Ober\u00f6sterreich werden pro Jahr 1\u00a0500 H\u00e4user gebaut. Vor zehn Jahren waren davon 1\u00a0200 mit \u00d6lheizungen ausgestattet. Dieses Jahr wurden in Ober\u00f6sterreich ganze sieben mit \u00d6lheizungen ausgestattet. Alles andere wurde ersetzt durch Biomasse, Netzwerke oder Pellets-Heizung. Das hat Arbeitspl\u00e4tze geschaffen f\u00fcr die Waldwirtschaft, f\u00fcr die Landwirtschaft, f\u00fcr die lokalen Installateure, und sogar die \u00d6lh\u00e4ndler sind heute Pellets-H\u00e4ndler.\nDahin m\u00fcssen wir, d.\u00a0h. wir m\u00fcssen die gute Praxis, die lokal und regional vorhanden ist, auf die europ\u00e4ische Ebene \u00fcbertragen. \u00dcbrigens hat auch D\u00e4nemark in diesem Bereich vorbildliche Arbeit geleistet. Wir hier im Parlament werden heute Nachmittag in dieser Richtung abstimmen. Sie m\u00fcssen dann Ihre Arbeit machen.\nUnd noch ein Wort zum Gr\u00fcnbuch: Herr Kommissar, wenn wir die Herzen der Europ\u00e4er gewinnen wollen, dann muss in das Gr\u00fcnbuch ein Kapitel hinein: \u201eWinning the hearts of Europeans, going on with renewals!\u201c Das ist das, was die B\u00fcrger von Europa, von uns, erwarten, und Sie sollten nicht hinter diesen Standard zur\u00fcckfallen.\n(Beifall)", "agenda_item": "Heating and cooling from renewable energy sources (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060214-ITEM-006", "intervention_id": "2-064", "summary_english": "```json\n{\n  \"headline\": \"Local Success Stories Show Potential for EU-Wide Renewable Heating Transition\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"The speaker addresses the need to transition from fossil fuel heating systems to renewable energy sources across Europe, highlighting the potential for job creation and economic benefits in the heating and cooling sector.\",\n  \"positionSum\": \"The speaker strongly supports expanding renewable heating solutions across Europe, advocating for scaling up successful local and regional practices to the EU level.
