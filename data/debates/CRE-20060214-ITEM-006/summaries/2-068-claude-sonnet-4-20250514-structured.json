Among other things, this is due to uneven subsidisation and the fact that subsidies for fossil fuels (coal, brown coal, oil shale) and nuclear energy are considerably greater than those for renewable energy. In several Member States, this situation has been brought about by the monopolistic position of those power plants that use fossil fuels. This situation has also been the primary obstacle to the formation of a common energy policy in the European Union.\nAt the moment, given that our external supply reliability is inadequate as well, one can only hope that the lesson Russia taught Europe at the beginning of the year will offer an additional stimulus to the development of renewable energy in the European Union, and that improving cooperation between the Member States will indeed lead us to a common European energy policy.", "lang": "ET", "original": "Andres Tarand (PSE). \u2013 Lugupeetud esimees, sooviksin r\u00f5hutada, et Mechtild Rothe raport v\u00e4\u00e4rib k\u00f5rget tunnustust, seda eesk\u00e4tt liikmesriikidele siduvate kohustuste seadmisega taastuvenergia kasutamisel.\nNagu teame, on senine energiaturg Euroopa Liidus oluliselt moonutatud.
