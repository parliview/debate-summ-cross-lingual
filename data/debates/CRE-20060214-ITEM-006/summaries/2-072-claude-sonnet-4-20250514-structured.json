We cannot carry on taking a complacent view of our dependence on external sources of energy. We must act intelligently and decisively, because there is no time to lose.\nI do not doubt that the initiatives announced by the Commissioner will have significant benefits for the Union\u2019s future, but we cannot forget the legislation that has already entered into force and that has not been transposed into national legislation by certain Member States with sufficient rigour.\nThere is no question that current oil prices provide a reference for the thresholds of viability for replacement technologies: there is a great opportunity here for renewable energy sources to reach competitive prices with public aid, in line with the legislation on State aid.\nAs the Commissioner has correctly diagnosed, compliance with the directive on renewable energy sources is turning out to be difficult. Biomass must play a fundamental role, since its potential is under-exploited. The directive on energy efficiency in buildings already contains certain provisions, on the use of biomass in heating, which need to be enhanced.\nWe believe that a new directive on heating and refrigeration that takes account of the excellent report by Mrs Rothe, and hence of renewable energy sources, must include objectives that are both ambitious and realistic: clear guidelines on funding mechanisms and an exemplary role for the public sector.\nWe are sure that the Commission will respond once again to these expectations.", "lang": "ES", "original": "Alejo Vidal-Quadras Roca (PPE-DE). \u2013 (ES) Se\u00f1or Presidente, se\u00f1or Comisario, queridos colegas, los recientes cortes de suministro de gas natural en Ucrania han puesto delante de nuestros ojos un problema al que, quiz\u00e1, no hab\u00edamos dado la importancia que merec\u00eda.\nAdem\u00e1s, durante las \u00faltimas semanas, la cotizaci\u00f3n del barril de crudo ha oscilado entre 60 y 65 d\u00f3lares, un precio que hace a\u00f1os nos hubiera parecido imposible.\nSi a todo ello sumamos la inestable situaci\u00f3n en Oriente Medio, la conclusi\u00f3n es evidente: la Uni\u00f3n Europea debe actuar con urgencia. No podemos seguir observando con complacencia nuestra dependencia energ\u00e9tica exterior. Hemos de actuar con inteligencia y decisi\u00f3n, porque no hay tiempo que perder.\nNo me cabe duda de que las iniciativas que ha anunciado el Comisario tendr\u00e1n importantes beneficios para el futuro de la Uni\u00f3n, pero no podemos olvidar la legislaci\u00f3n que ya ha entrado en vigor y que no ha sido trasladada con suficiente diligencia al Derecho nacional por algunos Estados miembros.\nSin duda, los actuales precios del petr\u00f3leo son una referencia para los umbrales de rentabilidad de las tecnolog\u00edas de sustituci\u00f3n: hay una gran oportunidad para que las fuentes de energ\u00eda renovables alcancen precios competitivos con ayudas p\u00fablicas, en l\u00ednea con la legislaci\u00f3n de ayudas de Estado.\nComo acertadamente ha diagnosticado el Comisario, el cumplimiento de la directiva sobre energ\u00edas renovables se presenta dif\u00edcil. La biomasa debe desempe\u00f1ar un papel fundamental, ya que su potencial est\u00e1 poco aprovechado. La directiva sobre eficiencia energ\u00e9tica en edificios ya contiene algunas disposiciones, sobre la utilizaci\u00f3n de biomasa en calefacci\u00f3n, en las que habr\u00e1 que profundizar.\nCreemos que una nueva directiva sobre calefacci\u00f3n y refrigeraci\u00f3n que tenga en cuenta el excelente informe de la se\u00f1ora Rothe, con fuentes de energ\u00eda renovables, debe incluir objetivos a la vez ambiciosos y realistas: directrices claras sobre mecanismos de financiaci\u00f3n y un papel ejemplar para el sector p\u00fablico.\nEstamos seguros de que la Comisi\u00f3n responder\u00e1 una vez m\u00e1s a las expectativas.", "agenda_item": "Heating and cooling from renewable energy sources (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060214-ITEM-006", "intervention_id": "2-072", "summary_english": "```json\n{\n  \"headline\": \"EU Must Urgently Promote Renewable Heating and Cooling to Reduce Energy Dependence\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"The speaker raises concerns about EU energy dependence highlighted by natural gas supply cuts in Ukraine, high oil prices (60-65 dollars per barrel), and Middle East instability.
