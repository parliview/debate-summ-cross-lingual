{"speaker": "Bernadette Bourzai (PSE). \u2013", "english": "Bernadette Bourzai (PSE). \u2013 (FR) Mr\u00a0President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating Mrs\u00a0Rothe on her excellent own-initiative report, which clearly calls upon the European Commission to draw up a legislative proposal on increasing the share of renewable energy in heating and cooling by July 2006. Heat and cooling networks and biomass, particularly woody biomass, are important outlets for the timber industry, fit in perfectly with a sustainable European forestry strategy and can support European efforts towards sustainable development, particularly the aim of 12% of all energy consumed being from renewable sources by 2010. However, there is currently no legislation governing the use of renewable energy for heating and cooling, and this gap must be filled following the publication of the European Commission's biomass action plan on 7\u00a0December last year.\nI would like to emphasise three points that I see as important. First of all, on 28\u00a0January, the Ecofin Council concluded a political agreement to extend the experimental reduced VAT rate on labour-intensive services until 2010. The important new aspect for the subject we are now discussing is the inclusion of district heating in the option provided for in Article\u00a012(3)(b) of the sixth VAT Directive, under the same heading as the supply of natural gas and electricity. The Member States can therefore now put an end to this disparity in the tax treatment of sales of heating energy and subscriptions to heat and cooling networks using renewable energy, and the supply of natural gas and electricity.\nI fully support the rapporteur's recommendation regarding the use of the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Funds and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD).", "lang": "FR", "original": "Bernadette Bourzai (PSE). - Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, chers coll\u00e8gues, je tiens d\u2019abord \u00e0 f\u00e9liciter Mechtild Rothe pour son excellent rapport d\u2019initiative qui demande clairement \u00e0 la Commission europ\u00e9enne d\u2019\u00e9laborer, avant juillet\u00a02006, une proposition l\u00e9gislative sur l\u2019accroissement de la part des \u00e9nergies renouvelables dans le domaine du chauffage et de la r\u00e9frig\u00e9ration. En effet, les r\u00e9seaux de chaleur et de froid et la biomasse, en particulier ligneuse, constituent des d\u00e9bouch\u00e9s importants pour la fili\u00e8re bois, s\u2019int\u00e8grent parfaitement dans une strat\u00e9gie foresti\u00e8re europ\u00e9enne durable et peuvent soutenir les efforts europ\u00e9ens de d\u00e9veloppement durable, et notamment l\u2019objectif des 12% d\u2019\u00e9nergies renouvelables en\u00a02010 sur le total d\u2019\u00e9nergie consomm\u00e9e. Or, il n\u2019existe pour l\u2019instant aucune l\u00e9gislation r\u00e9gissant la production de chaleur et de froid \u00e0 partir de sources renouvelables et il faut combler ce manque apr\u00e8s la publication du plan d\u2019action biomasse de la Commission europ\u00e9enne le 7\u00a0d\u00e9cembre dernier.\nJe voudrais insister sur trois points qui sont importants \u00e0 mes yeux. D\u2019abord, le Conseil Ecofin a conclu un accord politique le 28\u00a0janvier dernier pour prolonger jusqu\u2019en\u00a02010 l\u2019exp\u00e9rience des taux r\u00e9duits de TVA sur les services \u00e0 forte intensit\u00e9 de main-d\u2019\u0153uvre. La nouveaut\u00e9 importante pour le sujet qui nous occupe est l\u2019int\u00e9gration du chauffage urbain dans l\u2019option pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019article\u00a012, paragraphe\u00a03, point b), de la sixi\u00e8me directive\u00a0TVA, au m\u00eame titre que la fourniture de gaz naturel et d\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9. Les \u00c9tats membres peuvent donc d\u00e9sormais mettre fin \u00e0 cette in\u00e9galit\u00e9 de traitement fiscal entre les ventes d\u2019\u00e9nergie calorifique et les abonnements aux r\u00e9seaux de chaleur et de froid utilisant une \u00e9nergie renouvelable et la fourniture de gaz naturel et d\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9.\nJe souscris enti\u00e8rement \u00e0 la recommandation du rapporteur concernant le recours aux Fonds structurels, au Fonds de coh\u00e9sion et au FEADER.", "agenda_item": "Heating and cooling from renewable energy sources (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060214-ITEM-006", "intervention_id": "2-075", "summary_english": "{\"headline\": \"Strong Support for EU Legislation on Renewable Energy Heating and Cooling with Focus on Biomass and Equal Tax Treatment\",\n\"issueSum\": \"The speaker identifies a legislative gap in EU regulation of renewable energy for heating and cooling, despite the EU's goal of achieving 12% renewable energy consumption by 2010.
