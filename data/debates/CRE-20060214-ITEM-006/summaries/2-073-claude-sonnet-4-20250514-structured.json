This initiative will encourage EU states to embrace the use of renewable energy sources for heating and cooling and to create economic incentives for this.\nWhen discussing standards of energy efficiency in buildings, it is worth underlining a problem common to Lithuania, all of the Baltic countries and some of the other new EU Member States. A large proportion of the urban population there live in poor quality apartment blocks, built 20-40 years ago, if not earlier. These buildings have little heat insulation, heat use is regulated from a central boiler, and residents are unable to select the desired temperature. Both national governments and the European Commission should devote more attention to this problem. Money from the Union and Structural Funds should be allocated for the renovation of such buildings, in order to guarantee that homes are heated efficiently. The Commission could collate the best examples of similar house reconstructions, in order to help national governments decide whether to renovate or demolish such buildings.", "lang": "LT", "original": "Justas Vincas Paleckis (PSE). \u2013 Nor\u0117\u010diau pasveikinti prane\u0161\u0117j\u0105 Mechtild Rothe ir Energetikos komitet\u0105. \u0160i iniciatyva paskatins ES valstybes energingiau naudoti atsinaujinan\u010dius energijos i\u0161teklius \u0161ildymui ir au\u0161inimui, kurti tam ekonomines paskatas.\nKalbant apie pastat\u0173 energetinio efektyvumo standartus, verta pabr\u0117\u017eti problem\u0105, bendr\u0105 Lietuvai, visoms Baltijos \u0161alims ir kai kurioms kitoms naujosioms ES valstyb\u0117ms.
