{"speaker": "Vladim\u00edr Remek,", "english": "Vladim\u00edr Remek, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group . \u2013 ( CS ) Mr\u00a0President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to state that I regard the report as a well-executed piece of work. It provides an accurate outline of the current situation regarding the use of renewable sources of energy for heating and cooling. On the other hand, the European Parliament has repeatedly declared the need for greater use of renewables, and adopted the correct decisions and recommendations, only for little to change. Politicians talk more about the need to use renewables than those who take the real decisions in this area, that is to say the general public. One reason for this may be that the Member States have not been able to create the right conditions for the greater use of renewables and have not convinced people of the case for them. Consequently, as the report states, northern Denmark uses more solar energy than southern Italy, for example. The recommendations therefore attach great importance to informing and persuading people. They will only really take this on board, however, when renewables become more advantageous for them. The price of these types of energy is therefore important and this is part and parcel of creating the right conditions for the use of renewables. A current example of this from the Czech Republic does not directly involve renewables, but is all the more instructive for that. When the call was raised for the use of natural gas as a more environmentally-friendly form of heating, it brought a quick response, not only from individuals, but also from local and municipal authorities, who compared it with other fuels and, supported by various instruments, switched to gas. Now, however, after several major increases in gas prices they are returning in large numbers to types of fuel that are very bad for the environment, such as cheap and low-grade forms of coal, along with the inefficient burning not only of wood but even of plastics and tyres in local heating plants. They can, in short, no longer afford gas. It is therefore just as important to create the right conditions as it is to take sensible decisions, to make use of all the elements in the energy mix and to support energy saving measures. Otherwise, we may find ourselves following the example of the moth which, in its longing to draw closer to light and heat, often finds only death.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Vladim\u00edr Remek, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group . \u2013 ( CS ) Mr\u00a0President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to state that I regard the report as a well-executed piece of work.
