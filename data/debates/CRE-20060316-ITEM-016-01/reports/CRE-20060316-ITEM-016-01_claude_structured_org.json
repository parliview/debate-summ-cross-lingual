As yet, however, Russia has failed to acknowledge the sovereignty and constitutional integrity of that country\u2019s territory by withdrawing them. Transnistria is one of the most industrialised areas of Moldova. The continuing existence of a self-proclaimed political entity stands in the way of any chance of the country\u2019s economic situation returning to normal, or of the country being able to start the necessary preparations for any kind of talks with the European Union, whether about membership or even just about association.\nRussian policy strives to use all possible means to retain its superpower influence in Central and Eastern Europe, which it regards as its natural sphere of influence. The Transnistrian regime, supported by the former Red Army, is a blatant example of disregard for people, citizens and their rights. Corrupt troops carry on large-scale illegal arms trading there, along with many other criminal activities. The Russian Government\u2019s promises to withdraw its army have yet again proved to be a political ploy made without any respect for political partners, including the Member States of the European Union. It is a ploy aimed at allaying public opinion.\nMy question is as follows. How do we intend to formulate a European defence policy if we are unable to force our partners to abide by such clear obligations in respect of areas so close to us? Where can we show the power of persuasion of the 25 EU Member States if not in urgent matters like this one, which is key from the point of view of our own safety?\nIf we want any of our declarations on defence policy to have any meaning at all, we need to prove ourselves equal\u00a0to the task in specific cases such as this one, and to demonstrate our will to ensure that every partner, no matter how powerful, observes his undertakings.", "lang": "PL", "original": "Bogus\u0142aw Sonik (PPE-DE), autor . \u2013 Panie Przewodnicz\u0105cy!

Today, we voted on the enlargement strategy as proposed in the Brok report. If we, on that basis, restrict access to newcomers, the only chance Moldova has of joining is by circuitous means, according to the model of German reunification from 1990.\nThis would mean that, in due course, Moldova would have to relinquish its independence to return to Romania, from which it broke away in 1940. A solution of this kind was also mooted straight after the break-up of the Soviet Union, but Romania appeared not attractive enough at the time to implement this plan in the short term.\nThis may change if Romania\u2019s EU membership proves to be a runaway success and if Moldova realises that as a neighbouring country, it is much worse off. A reunification of this kind has never met with the support of the Slavic-speaking minority, though, who are mainly to be found in the east of the country and would much rather maintain the old ties with Ukraine and Russia. A solution may not present itself for the factual separation of the eastern fringe, the long and thin region of Transnistria situated along the border with Ukraine, until Ukraine joins the European Union. In the mean time \u2013 which can be some time \u2013 we should look to find peaceful solutions, cooperation and democratic changes within Transnistria, which is still being ruled with an iron fist.\nMy group has highlighted this in its own draft resolution. We regret that the joint resolution mentions a weakening of the Transnistrian Government, rather than its reform. For the rest, we can endorse the compromise document because, on the one hand, it does not incite violence against Transnistria and, on the other, this resolution does not seek to isolate Moldova by way of punishment for the strong position which the Communist Party has been accorded in that country by its voters.", "lang": "NL", "original": "Erik Meijer (GUE/NGL), auteur . \u2013 Voorzitter, de uiteenlopende politieke krachten in Moldavi\u00eb willen graag aansluiting bij de Europese Unie.

Vandaag hebben we gestemd over de uitbreidingsstrategie zoals die werd voorgesteld in het verslag Brok. Als wij op grond daarvan de toegang voor nieuwkomers beperken, kan Moldavi\u00eb straks alleen nog binnenkomen via een omweg. Dat is het model van de Duitse hereniging uit 1990.\nDit zou betekenen dat Moldavi\u00eb mettertijd de eigen zelfstandigheid zou moeten opgeven om terug te keren in Roemeni\u00eb, waarvan het in 1940 is afgescheiden. Zo'n oplossing was ook al onmiddellijk na het uiteenvallen van de Sovjet-Unie aan de orde, maar Roemeni\u00eb bleek toen niet aantrekkelijk genoeg om het op korte termijn door te voeren.\nDat kan veranderen als het Roemeense lidmaatschap van de Europese Unie een groot succes wordt en Moldavi\u00eb tot de conclusie komt dat het zich als buurland in een veel slechtere situatie bevindt. Maar zo'n hereniging heeft nooit de steun gehad van de Slavischtalige minderheid.

We are aware of the correspondence with Mr Klich, but that is no way to behave! I have been involved in policy towards the country of Belarus for 12 years and I can only say that in that time the Commission has never behaved as she did. I just wanted to say that straight away because she is present.\nIn contrast, while the Republic of Moldova is ruled by a communist party, it is interested in a rapprochement with the EU and is, at least as I see it, an active partner in the neighbourhood policy. The problem is a completely different one: it lies east of the River Nister. There are still Russian troops there, outside Russian territory, 15 years after the break-up of the Soviet Union.\nThat is precisely the problem: the stationing of Russian troops and the violation of the integrity of the Republic of Moldova, that is the conflict we are talking about. It is not an ethnic conflict. I therefore believe the problems can only be solved by very tough talking between the EU and Russia, with an ultimatum for the complete withdrawal of the troops. That is also in Europe\u2019s interest because it is the only way the border can be completely controlled. The regime that is living on those troops in Transnistria can then become a democratic part of Moldova instead.\nThe poverty in the country has greatly encouraged the trafficking of women, and that is another reason why it should also become part of the neighbourhood policy towards Moldova.", "lang": "DE", "original": "Elisabeth Schroedter (Verts/ALE), Verfasserin . \u2013 Herr Pr\u00e4sident!

Firstly, the dismantling of the criminal and militaristic structure in Transnistria by peaceful means. Thank God, Hitler was defeated and had to surrender his spoils.

The process of democratisation in this region that is so important for our own destiny will only succeed if this militaristic, tyrannical structure finally makes way for a democracy based on the rule of law.\nThis is our duty as the European Parliament, and I am therefore grateful to Mr Sonik and others for getting this debate held.

I will also be very happy to respond to Mrs\u00a0Schroedter before talking about the real substance of today\u2019s debate: human rights.\nFirst, on the political issue, Moldova is a country in the European Neighbourhood Policy and we are trying, through that policy, to bring Moldova closer to the European Union and \u2013 I point this out to Mr Posselt \u2013 slowly democratise it, although a lot still has to be done. However, this is the way forward. For that purpose, it is also very important to cut the illegal trafficking of goods, people, arms, perhaps also drugs, and to cut criminal activities.\nI thank all those who have mentioned a border mission. The European Union has introduced a border mission very recently in Transnistria, between Moldova and Ukraine. We have to thank Ukrainian President Yushchenko who, when he came to power, really started this initiative and has taken it up together with President Voronin. With my colleagues the Foreign Ministers of Ukraine and Moldova, we have succeeded in putting this in place. I think it works quite well, by the way, under a Hungarian leader in this region. Its real objective, in my view, is to cut illegal trafficking. That is not always easy, but in the long run it will reach its goal.\nYou all spoke about the Transnistrian conflict and how we can resolve it. Indeed, the OSCE has been trying to do everything to help and the European Union is more and more involved too.

The journalist who was sitting in our room at the press conference in Brussels asked me as Commissioner whether we as the European Commission were sending an EU election observation mission to Belarus. I said: \u2018No, the observation is being done by the OSCE/ODIHR\u2019. You know that is the case. I then added that the parliamentarians were not part of an official EU mission, because we do not have one. That was completely misinterpreted. Please accept that again as my explanation. I am glad you raised the matter because it has allowed me to clear it up.\nI not only wrote a letter to Mr Klich yesterday, I also spoke to him; he understood completely. I have also already issued a statement today on Belarus, where I am of course following events in the run-up to the elections, in which I also said how much I regret that the parliamentarians were denied admission by refusing them visas; they are of course always welcome here, that goes without saying and you ought to know that, since I am so much in favour of EU observer missions and am doing something for them to actually strengthen them.\nI am coming to my third point, which concerns today\u2019s debate on the resolutions on breaches of human rights in Moldova.\nThe motion for a resolution draws attention to the failures of the judicial system to secure fair trials. I should note that in 2005 Moldova adopted three laws which significantly strengthened the independence of the judiciary. So far as the Pasat case \u2013 the case of the former Defence Minister \u2013 is concerned, the Commission has raised the problems surrounding this case several times.

In summer 2004, for instance, the Transnistrian authorities forcibly closed six schools that taught the Moldovan language using the Latin script.

Debate Information\n\n**Topic:** Human rights in Moldova and in Transnistria in particular\n**Number of Contributions:** 10 speakers\n**Date:** Not specified in the provided materials\n**Forum:** European Parliament debate\n\n## 2. Executive Summary\n\nThis parliamentary debate addressed the ongoing crisis in the breakaway region of Transnistria, which declared independence from Moldova in 1992 with Russian military support, and the broader human rights situation in both territories.\n\n### Core Issues Identified\n\nAll speakers identified several critical issues:\n- **Russian Military Presence:** Continued deployment of Russian troops in Transnistria despite 1999 OSCE Istanbul commitments to withdraw by 2002\n- **Human Rights Violations:** Systematic abuses in Transnistria including political prisoners, media suppression, and harassment of NGOs\n- **Authoritarian Governance:** Transnistria described as operating under a repressive dictatorship\n- **Cross-border Crime:** Drug trafficking, human trafficking, and arms trade facilitated by the unresolved status\n\n### Speaker Positions and Arguments\n\n**Advocating for Immediate Action:**\nMarios Matsakis (ALDE) called for urgent diplomatic engagement, stating that \"all parties directly involved in the Transnistrian dispute...proceed immediately to fully engage themselves in honest negotiations.\" He emphasized the threat to regional stability between Moldova and Ukraine.\n\nBogus\u0142aw Sonik (PPE-DE) demanded EU action to force Russian compliance, arguing that \"Russia's policy aims to maintain imperial influence in Central-Eastern Europe\" and questioning European defense policy credibility if basic commitments cannot be enforced.\n\nElisabeth Schroedter (Verts/ALE) proposed \"strict EU-Russia dialogue with an ultimatum demanding complete withdrawal of Russian troops,\" identifying the military presence as the core problem affecting Moldova's territorial integrity.\n\n**Documenting Human Rights Abuses:**\nLidia Joanna Geringer de Oedenberg (PSE) condemned Transnistria's \"brutal arrests, inhumane prison conditions, and lack of freedom of speech and assembly,\" describing these as elements \"that cannot be tolerated in today's Europe.\"\n\nRyszard Czarnecki (NI) labeled Transnistria as \"Europe's least democratic region,\" noting that \"people sit in prisons\" while basic rights are systematically violated.\n\nJ\u00f3zef Pinior highlighted the creation of the pro-Putin youth movement 'Proryw,' designed to \"prevent democratic changes\" and maintain authoritarian control.\n\n**Supporting Peaceful Resolution:**\nErik Meijer (GUE/NGL) advocated for \"peaceful solutions, cooperation, and democratic changes within authoritarian Transnistria,\" warning against violent approaches and opposing the isolation of Moldova over its communist party's electoral success.\n\nBernd Posselt (PPE-DE) proposed \"peaceful dissolution of the criminal and militaristic structure in Transnistria\" while supporting Moldova's European integration as a fundamentally European country.\n\n### EU Commission Response\n\nCommissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner outlined existing EU efforts, including the border mission between Moldova and Ukraine to combat trafficking and diplomatic pressure on Russia. She acknowledged that \"since Moldova is unable to intervene in Transnistria, we raise the issue with Russia whenever the opportunity arises,\" emphasizing the Commission's work toward \"demilitarization and democratization of Transnistria.\"\n\n### Key Proposals\n\n1. **Immediate Russian troop withdrawal** from Transnistria as agreed in 1999 OSCE commitments\n2. **Enhanced EU diplomatic pressure** on Russia through ultimatum-backed dialogue\n3. **Continued EU border assistance mission** to combat cross-border crime and trafficking\n4. **Support for Moldova's democratic reforms** and EU integration process\n5. **Peaceful resolution mechanisms** through renewed multilateral negotiations\n6. **Human rights monitoring** and protection for political prisoners and civil society\n\n### Consensus and Divisions\n\nWhile all speakers condemned human rights violations in Transnistria, they differed on approaches. Most advocated for firm pressure on Russia, while Meijer emphasized avoiding isolation of Moldova and supporting peaceful solutions. The debate revealed unanimous concern about Russian military presence and systematic human rights abuses, with broad agreement on supporting Moldova's European integration while addressing the Transnistrian territorial dispute through diplomatic means.\n\nThe debate demonstrates European Parliament unity on condemning the situation while revealing tactical differences on engagement strategies with Russia and approaches to conflict resolution.", "src_model": "claude", "model_type": "claude", "model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "structured": true, "incremental": false, "hierarchical": false, "grouped": false, "shuffle": false, "prompt": false, "lang": "original"}
