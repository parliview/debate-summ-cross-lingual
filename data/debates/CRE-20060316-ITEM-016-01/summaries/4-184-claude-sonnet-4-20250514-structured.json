Following long discussions and major preparatory work, last December the EU finally launched a new mission \u2013 the EU Border Assistance Mission to Moldova and Ukraine \u2013 thus contributing to both countries\u2019 joint action to fight against smuggling and black-market trade in the region.\nSurprise, surprise! This very balanced move led Russia to put its 1100 troops \u2013 so-called peacekeepers \u2013 in Transnistria on alert last week. The illegal regime of Transnistria, which is not recognised by any democracy in the world, broke off the 5+2 talks.\nWe should express our concern about the human rights situation in Transnistria, where people do not have the right to hold democratic elections, where harassment, repression and intimidation of the independent media, human rights defenders, NGOs and opponents to the self-proclaimed regime is common practice. In addition, we should express our support for the Moldovan and Ukrainian authorities working to stabilise the situation in the region and free it from corruption, smuggling, etc.\nI call on the Commission and the Council to support the Moldovan authorities in their democratic reform process and use all diplomatic means available to solve the Transnistria conflict.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Laima Liucija Andrikien\u0117, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. \u2013 Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking our colleagues who initiated this very important debate and resolution on the situation in Moldova, and Transnistria in particular.\nThe Transnistrian conflict, frozen since 1992, was recently described as a front line in EU-Russia relations.
