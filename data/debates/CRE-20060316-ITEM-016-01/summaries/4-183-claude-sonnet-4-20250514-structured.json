{"speaker": "Lidia Joanna Geringer de Oedenberg (PSE)", "english": "Lidia Joanna Geringer de Oedenberg (PSE) , author . \u2013 (PL) Mr President, the dictatorship of the self-appointed authorities in Transnistria, characterised by severe repression and ideological backwardness, has aroused great concern in Europe.\nWhile Moldova has already taken significant steps on the path towards democracy and respect for civil liberties, Transnistria continues to violate fundamental human rights. Brutal arrests, inhuman detention conditions and a lack of freedom of speech or assembly are facts of everyday life in this region, and cannot be tolerated in today\u2019s Europe. Transnistria is well known for ignoring the rulings of the international community. Eighteen months have passed since the International Court of Human Rights issued its judgment in the case of Ilascu and other opposition figures, but not one of them has yet been released.\nAn important step towards resolving the conflict with Moldova is Russia\u2019s withdrawal of troops from the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria, in line with\u00a0the resolutions of the OSCE summit in Istanbul in 1999. To date, Moscow has violated its undertakings by continuing to give economic and political support to the local dictatorship and its repressive regime.\nAt the same time as welcoming Moldova\u2019s efforts as regards institutional reforms and respect for the rights of national minorities, including the Romanian minority, as a real step towards democratic dialogue with the European Union, we are at the same time aware of information about rampant corruption and illegal trafficking in women and children. The Moldovan authorities must continue their efforts to establish a stable and independent judiciary, as well as political pluralism in their country. For its part, the European Union must take decisive steps to resolve the issue of Transnistria, and increased dialogue between the EU and Moldova can help to resolve this long-standing conflict and to stabilise the situation in this region of Europe.", "lang": "PL", "original": "Lidia Joanna Geringer de Oedenberg (PSE), autorka . \u2013 Panie Przewodnicz\u0105cy!
