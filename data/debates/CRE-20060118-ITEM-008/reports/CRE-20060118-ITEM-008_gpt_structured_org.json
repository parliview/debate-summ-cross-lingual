It is a chance for us to reflect on what will be lost, especially for Parliament, should we be incapable of salvaging the project and bringing it to a successful conclusion. It is a chance for us to respond to the cacophony of sounds emerging from the ranks of the Council – some simplistic, some in breach of the Treaty, some improbable politically. It is a chance for us to encourage the Commission to be more forthright and incisive to assist us in finding a way forward out of the crisis. It is a chance for Parliament to fill some political space and to bring a focus to the period of reflection.\nWe know that we cannot achieve all this by ourselves but must have the close collaboration of national parliaments. I must say that I find it fairly curious in this context that the Presidents of the Austrian, Finnish and German Parliaments seem somewhat reluctant to cooperate with us. It is up to the parliaments to decide whether or not they turn up. Those who choose to turn up will have a decisive say in fashioning the decisions about the future of Europe.\nThe proposals, which received strong support from the committee, set out a parliamentary process. We seek to establish a series of parliamentary forums to debate some fundamental – perhaps even primitive – questions about the nature and purpose of Europe. We want to have the debate about the reform of common policies that the first Convention was in some part frustrated in being denied. This policy debate can and should be radical, but it must take place within the constitutional context and be closely related to issues of competences, to instruments and to procedures.\nThe first of these forums will take place on 9 May and will address its conclusions to the European Council, which is to take some first decisions about the furtherance of the project.\nWe would like to draw the period of reflection to a close at the end of 2007 with a firm, clear decision on what to do with the Treaty. As the resolution states, there are, in theory, several scenarios we could follow, but in practice there are only two. The first is to supplement the present Treaty with interpretative protocols or declarations. The second is to make rather more substantive changes to Part III so that we address the legitimate concerns and disquiet expressed by citizens in France and the Netherlands and in some other Member States.\nBetween and inside the groups there is certainly controversy about the appropriate way to express ourselves. However, on the essentials of salvaging the Treaty, we are strongly united and I commend the resolution to Parliament.\n(Applause)",

      "english": "Johannes Voggenhuber (Verts/ALE), rapporteur . – (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, today sees us presenting the report on the period of reflection on the European Union, from which, after many months of debate, and endorsed by the overwhelming majority on the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, emerged a road map showing a way out of the constitutional crisis. Little time now remains before Parliament takes this great step, this great decision, but if I had no more than a minute in which to speak, I would use it to thank my fellow rapporteur, Mr Duff, for the extraordinary honour and pleasure of working with him on this.\nFrom him I learned that the future – by which I mean the future we share in this Europe of ours – can be found by looking in the most diverse directions, and for that I am very grateful to him. If the combination of a Green Austrian and an English Liberal is not a handicap from the word go, then I do believe that other combinations can work just as well.\nOf course, not even the harmonious notes sounded by the President of the Council’s magic flute this morning could mask the crisis that is going on in Europe, and, while he did not mention it, I would like to, and I would like to say something about what is at the heart of this crisis. At the centre of this whole, newly-ignited, dispute, the disagreements we have, and the European crisis, is a single sentence uttered by the founding father of the European Union, Jean Monnet, who said, ‘We are not uniting states; we are uniting people’. That is what today’s argument is about.\nAre we to have a Europe of chancelleries, governments and elites, or the union of citizens to which this constitution has opened the door? Those who talk as if the constitution were dead are rejecting the human Europe, giving the intergovernmental Europe a shot in the arm and conjuring up the ghosts of the 19th century, those primal misfortunes from Pandora’s box: nationalism, rivalry between states, the concept of the balance of power, the striving for dominance, a fragmented Europe incapable of maintaining its own peace, let alone of becoming a power for peace. That is what this dispute is about.\nBefore we entered the Chamber, there were fellow Members there to welcome us dressed as ostriches. They had no need to dress up, for we knew perfectly well who they were, and we are not blind; we know that the nationalists regarded the temporary failure of the ratification process as presenting them with an historic opportunity for a nationalist renaissance. To them, by this report, and with virtual unanimity, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs delivers a resounding ‘no’.\n(Applause)\nThe Constitution is not dead, for people’s need for a future in which they can live in Europe in freedom and peace at home and abroad lives on as an objective in their hearts and minds, and the Constitution is a crucial step in moving towards a social order, a political architecture, a political space, in which such a future is possible.\nThe crisis that the report we are presenting today attempts to resolve is a crisis of confidence, the crisis of a Union that cannot tell the difference between a union of citizens and a union of states, a Union in which people’s expectations are disappointed as a veritable matter of course. It has no answer to social issues, it suffers from a democracy deficit, fundamental rights are not secured, there is not enough transparency, and the power of governments is unbridled and subject to few controls. This constitution, though, is a step forward, and if it is beset by difficulties, then we will try to keep it on course.\nWhat we have conceived is a European debate; I see us as bringing the process back to the people, and that adds up to nothing less than taking the elites’ project and turning it into a res publica , a popular cause.\nI hope that this House – if it adopts this report – will join us in appealing to all the parties, to the population at large, to the municipalities and regions, to the trade unions and to civil society, to carry on with this debate, to take up the future of this Europe of ours as a popular cause and to join with us in contending for it.\nWe did not envisage that this debate should be without form. We, in all the groups, agreed on six questions, covering many issues that people fight shy of talking about: the goal of European integration, the borders of Europe, the future of the economic and social model, Europe’s role in the world, the area of security, freedom and law, not to mention the social issues – and, even if the constitution does not do all the things we want it to do, which it goes without saying it will not, then I do nonetheless hope that this plan brings us a good deal closer to this objective.\nPerhaps I might say one more thing about precisely where our difference with the Constitutional Affairs Committee lies. What the rapporteurs want, and what they have fought for, is another step forward rather than the continued ratification process being regarded as the end product of this debate; they want it also to be possible to improve the constitution, to retain what is at its heart and, in 2007, to revise it in a more open process and a more credible debate, with the revision to be presented to the public in a Europe-wide referendum. My hope is that, aided by the Commission’s level-headedness and this House’s courage, this further step may be taken.\n(Applause)",

Wir legen heute den Bericht zur europäischen Reflexionsphase vor, aus der nach vielen Monaten der Diskussion und mit überwältigender Unterstützung des Ausschusses für konstitutionelle Fragen eine road map zur Überwindung der Verfassungskrise wurde. Es sind wenige Minuten zu diesem großen Schritt und zu dieser großen Entscheidung des Parlaments, aber wenn ich auch nur eine Minute zu reden hätte, würde ich sie nutzen, um mich bei meinem Ko-Berichterstatter, Andrew Duff, für diese ganz außergewöhnliche Ehre und das Vergnügen zu bedanken, mit ihm diese Arbeit machen zu dürfen.\nEr hat mich gelehrt, dass man aus den verschiedensten Richtungen die Zukunft, und zwar die gemeinsame Zukunft, in einem Europa, in unserem Europa, finden kann. Vielen Dank! Ein grüner Österreicher und ein liberaler Engländer - wenn das kein Handicap für den Beginn ist, dann, so glaube ich, können auch andere zueinander finden.\nHerr Präsident, die harmonischen Töne aus der politischen Zauberflöte des Ratspräsidenten heute Vormittag haben natürlich die europäische Krise nicht überdecken können. Er hat nicht davon gesprochen. Ich möchte davon sprechen, und ich möchte vom Kern dieser Krise sprechen. All dieser neu ausgebrochene Streit, die Zerwürfnisse, die europäische Krise drehen sich um einen einzigen Satz, ausgesprochen von DEM Gründervater der Europäischen Union, Jean Monnet: „Wir vereinigen Menschen, nicht Staaten“. Der Streit, der heute geführt wird, geht darum.\nGibt es ein Europa der Staatskanzleien, der Regierungen, der Bürokratien, der Eliten, oder gibt es die Union der Bürger, zu der diese Verfassung den Weg geöffnet hat? Wer heute vom Tod der Verfassung spricht, erteilt dem Europa der Menschen eine Absage, stärkt das Europa der Regierungen und beschwört die Gespenster des 19. Jahrhunderts herauf, jene Urkrankheiten aus der Büchse der Pandora, den Nationalismus, die Rivalität der Staaten, das Balancedenken, das Hegemoniestreben, das Europa der Zersplitterung, das seinen eigenen Frieden nicht wahren, geschweige denn zu einer Friedensmacht werden kann. Darum wird dieser Streit geführt.\nDa draußen vor dem Saal haben uns Abgeordnetenkollegen als Vogel Strauß verkleidet empfangen. Sie hätten sich nicht verkleiden müssen, wir haben sie auch so gut erkannt, und wir sind nicht blind; wir wissen, dass das vorläufige Scheitern des Ratifikationsprozesses in den Augen der Nationalisten eine historische Chance für die Renaissance des Nationalismus ist. Dem erteilt dieses Haus in großer Übereinstimmung aller im Ausschuss für konstitutionelle Fragen vertretenen Fraktionen mit diesem Bericht eine Absage.\n(Beifall)\nDie Verfassung ist nicht tot, weil das Bedürfnis der Menschen, in der Zukunft frei und gleich in innerem und äußerem Frieden in Europa zusammenzuleben, als Ziel in den Köpfen und Herzen der Menschen Bestand hat. Und auf dem Weg, eine Ordnung zu finden, eine politische Architektur, einen politischen Raum zu entwerfen, in dem das möglich ist, ist die Verfassung ein entscheidender Schritt.\nWir legen heute einen Bericht vor, in dem versucht wird, eine Strategie zur Beilegung dieser Krise zu entwerfen. Es ist eine Vertrauenskrise, es ist die Krise einer Union, die zwischen der Union der Bürger und der Union der Staaten nicht unterscheiden kann, in der die Erwartungen der Menschen geradezu programmatisch enttäuscht werden. Die Antwort auf die soziale Frage fehlt, die Demokratie ist defizitär, die Grundrechte sind nicht verankert, die Transparenz ist ungenügend, die Macht der Regierungen wenig kontrolliert und nicht gezähmt. Aber diese Verfassung ist ein Schritt, und wenn sie in Schwierigkeiten ist, so versuchen wir, auf diesem Weg fortzufahren.\nWir haben eine europäische Debatte entworfen; ich denke, wir bringen den Prozess zurück zu den Bürgern, und das heißt nicht weniger, als aus einem Projekt der Eliten eine res publica zu machen, eine Sache der Menschen selbst.\nIch hoffe, das Haus appelliert - wenn es diesen Bericht annimmt - mit uns auch an alle Parteien, an die Bevölkerung, an die Kommunen und Regionen, an die Gewerkschaften, an die zivile Gesellschaft, diese Debatte zu führen und diese Zukunft Europas als res publica mit aufzunehmen und mit uns darum zu streiten.\nWir haben diese Debatte nicht unstrukturiert vorgeschlagen. Wir haben uns, quer durch die Fraktionen, auf sechs Fragen geeinigt, darunter viele tabuisierte Fragen: das Ziel der europäischen Integration, die Grenzen Europas, die Zukunft des ökonomischen und sozialen Modells, die Rolle Europas in der Welt, die Frage des Raums von Sicherheit, Freiheit und Recht, auch die soziale Frage. Und auch wenn die Verfassung nicht alle Wünsche erfüllt - selbstverständlich tut sie das nicht -, so hoffe ich, dass wir mit diesem Plan diesem Ziel einen großen Schritt näher kommen.\nErlauben Sie mir nur noch ein Wort dazu, wo die Differenz zum Ausschuss für konstitutionelle Fragen liegt. Die Berichterstatter sind gewillt und haben darum gekämpft, einen Schritt weiterzugehen und nicht nur die Fortsetzung des Ratifikationsprozesses als Ergebnis dieser Debatte zu sehen, sondern auch die Möglichkeit, die Verfassung zu verbessern, ihren Kern zu erhalten und 2007 einen Revisionsprozess zu beschließen, offener darzulegen, um die Debatte glaubwürdiger zu machen, und eine solche Revision auch in einer europäischen Volksbefragung den Bürgern vorzulegen. Ich hoffe, dass bei diesem weiteren Schritt zur Besonnenheit der Kommission noch der Mut des Plenums hinzukommt.\n(Beifall)",

Key issues highlighted include the nature of European integration—whether it should be an elite-driven process or one led by citizens; the threat of rising nationalism and state rivalry; a crisis of confidence in the Union; democratic deficits; lack of solutions to social issues; insufficient transparency; unbridled government power; and citizen disconnection from the EU project.",
        "positionSum": "Voggenhuber strongly supports reviving and continuing the constitutional process as a means of 'uniting people' rather than just states, emphasizing the need to transform the constitutional debate into a truly public, citizen-driven initiative. He opposes nationalist tendencies and a purely intergovernmental Europe, advocating instead for the constitutional process to advance social order, democracy, fundamental rights, and peace.",
        "argSum": "He argues that treating the Constitution as 'dead' empowers nationalistic, 19th-century divisions and undermines the original vision of European integration. Voggenhuber claims the Constitution addresses crucial social and democratic deficits and serves as an essential foundation for a peaceful, social, and transparent Europe. He stresses the need to bring the constitutional debate directly to the public and reform it through open, inclusive mechanisms instead of limiting the process to elite or governmental actors.",
        "propSum": "Voggenhuber proposes a European debate structured around six central questions: the goal of European integration, defining Europe's borders, the future of the economic and social model, Europe’s global role, security/freedom/law, and social issues.

We are indeed going through a crisis of confidence where the European public are concerned. We must answer those questions that they have every right to ask of us. I also agree with Mr Duff that this crisis of confidence and these misgivings about the European project present all of us with an opportunity, of which all of us together – the Commission, Parliament and the Council – must make use.\nIt is at this point that I would like to extend most especial thanks to your House, for you were wrestling with this issue at a time when the governments were not yet willing to make a serious start on debate. The Duff/Voggenhuber report has been the occasion, in this House, for a debate that will help us to move on. The Austrian Presidency has, from its very first day, endeavoured to engage in this debate, to carry it further and develop it. You will all have been able, as you followed it, to note how very vigorous it has been from the very outset, with the whole spectrum of opinions being given voice, and the report adopted by the Constitutional Affairs Committee reflects that.\nOne thing that does come across clearly is that there are no quick fixes, no tricks and no shortcuts, whereby we might, so to speak, throw a bridge across the confidence gap between Europe and its citizens. Only a real and serious engagement with the problems will be credible and effective in the long term. Our belief that this debate must be a wide-ranging one reflects the view expressed in your report, which we are debating today. What we need is not just a debate about the constitutional treaty or the legal dimension, but a broad debate on what sort of Europe we want, where we want to go, where Europe’s borders are, and how we can address the European public’s fears and worries.\nWe, in the Council, want not only to continue with this debate, but also to conduct it in greater depth. We have planned a series of events at which we want to have broad-based discussions with the European public. Only yesterday, we were discussing with the Commission and with your House the methods and strategies whereby we might communicate this Europe of ours and what it stands for to the public and by what means, in what discussion forums and in what depth we might best meet the expectations that people have of Europe.\nAs the President of the Council said today, we do intend, at the same time as we kick off the debate, to consider the issue of European identity. On the 250th anniversary of Mozart’s birth, in Salzburg, we intend to address the question of ‘What is Europe, what is the European identity?’\nRight through to the end of the Austrian Presidency, there will be a whole series of other events, for the debate on Europe’s future is a many-sided one, and it is only when all of its sides are lit that all the dimensions with which we have to do become apparent. Important though this public debate is, there will also have to be practical work done in order that it may be clearer to us which way we should go, and it will have to be done by the governments of the Member States.\nThe Council Presidency’s most important task is to get all the Member States on board, for it is only together that we will be able to move forward. As the Chancellor has already said, what we want to achieve is to be able, at the end of our Presidency, to produce a sketch of the way ahead and to agree on how we can best cooperate in achieving our common goals.\nI hope that one consequence of our joint effort over the coming months will be an increase in positive thinking in Europe, and I agree with Mr Voggenhuber that we must discuss Europe as a res publica , as something that really is to the benefit of all its citizens.\n(Applause)",

        "positionSum": "The speaker supports wide-ranging, deep, and inclusive debate as a response to this crisis, opposing quick fixes or superficial approaches. They advocate extending the debate beyond legal and constitutional matters to fundamental questions about the purpose, boundaries, and identity of Europe.",

The speaker contends that the complexity of the issue requires comprehensive discussion, involving all EU institutions and the public, and that practical measures must accompany public debate to determine the future path of the EU.",
        "propSum": "Specific proposals include organizing a series of events aimed at engaging the European public in discussion, collaborating with the Commission and Parliament to develop communication strategies about the EU, and addressing the question of European identity (e.g., during the celebration of Mozart's 250th anniversary in Salzburg).

      "english": "Margot Wallström, Vice-President of the Commission . Mr President, honourable Members, in this first plenary part-session of the year I should like to wish all of you an excellent 2006. From the Constitutional point of view, I believe it can only be better than last year. I hope, as the person responsible both for Constitutional issues and for interinstitutional affairs, that we can continue our fruitful, effective and close cooperation.\nI wish to thank the rapporteurs for this report on the period of reflection and the motion for a resolution. I have already discussed it on several occasions with the two Members of the European Parliament who were members of the European Convention. I would like to underline the considerable progress made since the initial considerations and congratulate the co-rapporteurs for the job they have done and also for their ability to take on board the many views expressed during the intense discussions in committee.\nI will limit my remarks to four points. The first is that we all wish to achieve a constitutional settlement, to make Europe more transparent, more democratic and more effective. The question is how to achieve that settlement after the French and Dutch ‘no’ votes. I was happy to see that all options regarding the Constitution remain open in your resolution. During the reflection period it is essential to listen to citizens, social partners, political parties, and national and regional parliaments without prejudging the result of the wider dialogue and debate. If we do not, this exercise will lose all its value.\nI also took note of your favourite option. Maintaining the Constitution, however, will not be possible without French and Dutch support with, if necessary, additional clarifications and measures. Recent Eurobarometer surveys have shown that European citizens’ support for the concept of a Constitution for the EU has increased by two percentage points over the past five months to 63%. Therefore, as has been said many times in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, it is important to change the context rather than the text. That is why the dialogue has to focus on the European project in connection with Constitutional reform, and on the ultimate objective linked to the instruments to deliver it. It is only after the listening exercise based on the results of national debates is complete, that we will be able to draw conclusions on the best Constitutional settlement for Europe. That is also why the Commission wants to focus on policy priorities addressing citizens’ concerns on growth, jobs, employment and security.\nSecondly, I fully share your resistance to proposals for core groups of certain Member States. What we want is a Europe for everyone, not just for some. The Union is in the process of consolidating the most recent accession process. We still have to work hard to ensure the smooth integration of the new Member States. My view is that any enhanced cooperation must, in all circumstances, be undertaken within the existing Treaties and remain open to all Member States.\nYou can rest assured that the Commission and myself will not support any proposal for enhanced cooperation outside the European Union institutional framework.\n(Applause)\nThirdly, it seems reasonable to me to draft final conclusions on the reflection period in 2007, under the German or Portuguese Presidency. The June 2006 European Council is clearly a major milestone in this process, but it should not be the end of it. It will, of course, be up to the European Council to decide on any potential extension of the reflection period beyond the June 2006 extension already suggested by the Austrian Presidency. In any case, as announced in Plan D, the Commission will prepare a communication for the June European Council setting out its thinking on the initial feedback received during the period of reflection, and this will be based on the national visits currently being undertaken by the President, myself and fellow Commissioners, a special Eurobarometer report, discussion forums and the 9 May conferences.\nThis synthesis report should explain the background and approach taken by the Commission over the last year, outline the initial results of the listening exercise and provide a series of conclusions for the Austrian Presidency on the next steps to be taken. This will complement the factual report that will be prepared by the Austrian Presidency on the basis of contributions from the Member States.\nFourthly, I support your rejection of piecemeal implementation of the Constitution. The reason for that is simple - it has to do with respect. Respect for those who said ‘no’ and for those who have already ratified, and respect for the institutional balance. Cherry-picking could give the impression that the Union is trying to circumvent the results of national referenda and is liable to impair the overall institutional balance.\nWe should respect the difference between our institutions and those in the Member States and, most of all, when we embark on various praiseworthy initiatives and projects we should always respect each country’s democratic traditions. All of us play important, but different, roles.\nIn conclusion, I would stress that we cannot discuss these issues without entering into political debate and discussing political priorities. European citizens will see that there are political differences in Europe. This is another forum for discussing political priorities, but without it and without any discussion on constitutional matters nothing will work. We have to combine this process with creating legitimacy for our institutions by delivering the political results that European citizens want, so we have to consider their daily concerns as well as the constitutional issues.\n(Applause)",

The main issues include how to achieve a constitutional settlement moving forward, the importance of inclusive dialogue with all stakeholders, opposition to exclusive 'core groups' of Member States, the appropriate timeline for reaching conclusions, and rejection of partial or piecemeal implementation of the Constitution.",

That is what the period of reflection needs to be used for; it is not a period for debate on details in the constitution, but a time when Europe must be justified to people.\nIt has to be clear to us, and we have to make it clear to others, that the constitutional treaty contains things the absence of which the public formerly criticised, such as greater capacity to act in foreign and security policy matters, on which the opinion I have drafted concentrates, and which, according to all opinion surveys, is precisely what the public want. They want Europe to be represented to the outside world, and it is precisely so that it may be that there are rules in the constitution, rules that only it provides for and which we, under present conditions, cannot lay down without it. It creates a new form of subsidiarity involving the national parliaments, thereby making centralisation impossible, and backs up this concept of subsidiarity with solidarity.\nCitizens’ rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights have a major part to play in this. This constitution makes the citizens into decision-making actors and also provides them with protection. It must also be clear to us that in future, for example, the President of the Commission, as head of the European executive, will emerge directly from the elections to the European Parliament, with the public having a part to play in that. That is why we should focus on the fact that Parts I and II are the actual constitutional treaty itself, whilst Part III is the Treaty of Nice, about which there have been misunderstandings that we have not been able to eradicate, and so I am grateful to the Austrian Presidency for its willingness to put forward a ‘road map’ and glad that Germany, during its presidency, intends to take new initiatives. We should now concentrate on dialogue, assess the reflection period, and put forward our proposals in 2007. It follows from this that we cannot take action right now, as Mr Duff and Mr Voggenhuber propose; that would be premature and does not reflect what the public wants.",

Der Entwurf des Verfassungsvertrags hat im Rahmen des Konvents und der Regierungskonferenz eine Balance ergeben, die im Wesentlichen durch die nationalen Parlamente, die die stärkste Gruppe im Verfassungskonvent bildeten, getragen wurde. Vierzehn Länder haben ratifiziert, zwei davon durch Referendum, zwei nicht. Dieses Scheitern, das ja auch mit nationalen Fragen, aber auch mit der Stimmung in Europa insgesamt zu tun hat, ist ein Scheitern nationaler Politik, aber auch europäischer Politik, weil es uns nicht gelungen ist, Europa zu begründen.\nWir müssen die Sorgen der Bürger ernst nehmen; wir müssen sie auch in Frankreich und in den Niederlanden ernst nehmen und können nicht einfach darüber hinweggehen, aber wir sollten deutlich machen, warum wir dieses Europa brauchen. Dafür muss die Reflexionsphase genutzt werden. Dies ist kein Zeitraum der Debatte über Einzelheiten der Verfassung, sondern Europa muss in den Begründungen zu den Menschen zurückgebracht werden.\nDabei müssen wir auch sehen und deutlich machen, dass der Verfassungsvertrag gerade Dinge beinhaltet, die der Bürger kritisiert, weil sie bisher fehlen, z. B. eine größere Handlungsfähigkeit im Bereich der Außen- und Sicherheitspolitik, worauf sich meine Stellungnahme konzentriert. Alle Meinungsumfragen sagen, dass die Bürger genau das wollen: die Vertretung Europas nach außen hin. Und dafür bietet die Verfassung Regelungen, die nur sie vorsieht und die wir unter den gegenwärtigen Bedingungen nicht nebenher schaffen können. Sie schafft einen neuen Weg der Subsidiarität unter Mitwirkung der nationalen Parlamente, um auf diese Art und Weise Zentralismus zu verhindern, und verbindet diesen Gedanken der Subsidiarität mit der Solidarität.\nDie Bürgerrechte und die Charta der Grundrechte spielen eine große Rolle. Die Bürger werden durch diese Verfassung zu entscheidenden Akteuren, und sie bekommen auch den Schutz. Man muss auch sehen, dass in Zukunft beispielsweise der Kommissionspräsident als Spitze der europäischen Exekutive unmittelbar als Resultat aus den Wahlen zum Europäischen Parlament hervorgeht und die Bürger dabei eine Rolle spielen. Deshalb sollten wir uns auch darauf konzentrieren, dass die Teile I und II der eigentliche Verfassungsvertrag sind, während Teil III der Vertrag von Nizza ist. Dieses Missverständnis haben wir bisher nicht ausräumen können. Daher bin ich dankbar, dass die österreichische Präsidentschaft eine road map vorlegen wird und Deutschland in seiner Präsidentschaft neue Initiativen ergreifen will. Wir sollten uns jetzt auf den Dialog konzentrieren, die Reflexionsphase bewerten und 2007 die Vorschläge vorlegen. Dies bedeutet, dass wir nicht jetzt schon Maßnahmen ergreifen sollten, wie Duff und Voggenhuber es in ihrem Antrag vorschlagen. Dies ist zu früh und entspricht nicht den Wünschen der Bürger.",

I know that the issues that Mr Brok has just raised have prompted a great deal of debate, not least within the political groupings in this House, and there is much to be said for both positions. Perhaps we have to begin with the issues of substance, which we may well have neglected to some degree; how, for example, can we persuade the public that Europe needs a constitution of the kind that has been drafted? I gave a number of examples in the opinion I drafted on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, and perhaps I can adduce one that did not yet count for much at the time I was writing, but has acquired significance over the past few days in this House. I refer, of course, to the issue of energy.\nIt was pretty surprising, indeed pretty astonishing, to see how many Members of this House who had, until recently, perhaps taken a rather sceptical view of such things, are now forthright advocates of a common energy policy; I was delighted to hear what Mr Saryusz-Wolski had to say on the subject. The Federal Chancellor is a constant advocate of subsidiarity; today, as President of the Council, he argued strongly in favour of a common energy policy. This is just one example showing how important it is that the powers and prerogatives that we, particularly in the Constitution, have accorded to the European level be used to the utmost. I see this as the road down which we must go.\nI could, at this point, for example, talk about space policy, which has been another topic for debate in this place, and which is not about sending Europeans into space, but rather about monitoring the environment or giving warnings of tsunamis in good time. There are plenty of other things that are realistic and feasible and capable of being explained to the public if we focus on matters of substance rather than the institutional issues.\nWhat we in this House expect, of course, is a road map or sketch of how things are to progress. I beg you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in all the weighty matters with which you will have to deal over the coming weeks and months of this Presidency, to highlight how much better we could handle them if we had a European constitution. That is absolutely vital.",

Vielleicht ist die Frage zu früh gestellt. Vielleicht müssen wir mit dem anfangen, was wir möglicherweise ein bisschen vernachlässigt haben, nämlich die inhaltliche Dimension. Wie können wir die Bürgerinnen und Bürger davon überzeugen, dass wir in Europa eine Verfassung, wie sie erarbeitet worden ist, brauchen? In meiner Stellungnahme, die ich für den Ausschuss für Industrie, Forschung und Energie ausarbeiten konnte, habe ich einige Beispiele angeführt. Vielleicht kann ich das Beispiel nennen, das damals noch nicht viel Gewicht hatte, in den letzten Tagen in diesem Parlament aber Gewicht bekommen hat: die Energiefrage!\nEs war schon überraschend und erstaunlich, dass sich viele Abgeordnete, die vielleicht bis vor kurzem der europäischen Energiepolitik mit einer gewissen Skepsis gegenüberstanden, jetzt sehr massiv für eine gemeinsame Energiepolitik ausgesprochen haben. Ich habe sehr begrüßt, was Herr Saryusz-Wolski gesagt hat. Der Herr Bundeskanzler als Ratspräsident, der immer wieder die Subsidiarität betont, hat sich heute deutlich für eine gemeinsame Energiepolitik ausgesprochen. Dies ist nur ein Beispiel, um zu zeigen, wie wichtig es ist, dass die Zuständigkeiten, die wir auf europäischer Ebene - gerade auch in der Verfassung - verankert haben, auch wirklich voll genutzt werden. Ich glaube, das ist der Weg, den wir gehen müssen.\nIch könnte jetzt beispielsweise die Frage der Raumfahrtpolitik erwähnen, über die wir hier auch gesprochen haben und wo es nicht darum geht, Europäer in den Weltraum zu schicken, sondern um die Frage der Kontrolle der Umwelt oder die Frage, Tsunami-Warnungen rechtzeitig zur Verfügung zu stellen. Viele andere Dinge sind realistisch, machbar und gegenüber dem Bürger erklärbar, wenn wir uns nicht auf die institutionellen Fragen konzentrieren, sondern auf die inhaltlichen Fragen.\nHerr Ratspräsident! Wir in diesem Parlament erwarten natürlich diese road map oder diese Skizze, wie es weitergehen soll. Ich bitte Sie inständig, dass Sie bei all dem, was Sie in den nächsten Wochen und Monaten der Ratspräsidentschaft inhaltlich zu tun haben, darauf hinweisen, wie viel besser wir es tun könnten, wenn wir eine europäische Verfassung hätten.

With the referendum on the Constitution in France and the Netherlands, the citizens who wanted to get in and watch from the terraces went beyond that and organised an actual invasion of the pitch. Today’s crisis in Europe also lies in the fact that it is no longer possible to go back behind closed doors, back to the Europe of the Treaties and elitist decisions, and that, at the same time, no one knows how to get the people back onto the terraces so that they can express their opinions properly as fans normally do.\nReinventing a system of participation and accountability, whereby the Union answers directly to the citizens, without the self-seeking, distorting and misleading mediation of the Member States, is a prerequisite for setting the European project in motion again, whatever its new content may be. The question is, however, accountability for what? We must avoid the mistake of turning the pause for reflection into a pause of inaction.\nNo Plan D will be a success if, in addition to the ‘D’ for ‘debate’, ‘dialogue’ and ‘democracy’, it does not also include ‘D’ for ‘delivery’. Delivery is the best context in which to recast the text of the Constitution, and the best way to make people understand just how useful Europe can be. That is why even self-inflicted failures, like today’s de facto refusal to regulate market access to port services, can become symbolically dangerous.\nThere are areas of recognised European competence in which the existing treaties already provide for qualified majority voting and the interinstitutional codecision procedure – transport is one example. There are also areas where subsidiarity should properly be interpreted in reverse: not letting the Member States do badly what can be done better at a European level. In these areas of competence, the Union must raise its delivery rate and dare to show how useful it can be.\nToday it is no longer enough to see the Union merely as a clever solution to the problems of war, including the Cold War. What we need is a Union that is equal to the global challenges of the third millennium. We are also reflecting in order to better understand what we must do tomorrow, but we must be careful not to let that be an excuse for any inaction on our part today, or we would risk invalidating all our reflection, no matter how clever it might be.",

Con il referendum sulla Costituzione di Francia e Olanda, i cittadini che si volevano ammettere come spettatori sugli spalti sono andati oltre e hanno organizzato delle vere e proprie invasioni di campo. Oggi la crisi europea risiede anche nel fatto che non è più possibile ritornare alle porte chiuse, all’Europa dei trattati e delle decisioni elitarie e che, nel contempo, non si sa come riportare i cittadini sugli spalti a esprimere le loro opinioni attraverso un tifo corretto.\nLa reinvenzione di un circuito di partecipazione e di accountability, ossia di rendicontazione dell’Unione diretta ai cittadini, senza le intermediazioni interessate, falsificanti e fuorvianti degli Stati membri, è un presupposto per rimettere in moto il progetto europeo, qualunque siano i suoi nuovi contenuti. Ma rendicontazione di che cosa? L’errore da evitare è quello di trasformare la pausa di riflessione in una pausa di inazione.\nNessun “piano D” avrà successo se oltre alle “D” di “dibattito”, “dialogo” e “democrazia” non vi sarà anche la “D” di “ delivery ” . Delivery è il miglior contesto entro il quale ridefinire il testo della Costituzione, il miglior modo per far capire quanto sia utile l’Europa. Ed è per questo che possono diventare simbolicamente pericolosi anche insuccessi auto-inflitti, come la rinuncia di fatto di oggi a regolare l’accesso al mercato dei servizi portuali.\nEsistono aree di riconosciuta competenza europea per le quali i trattati esistenti prevedono già oggi il voto a maggioranza qualificata e la codecisione interistituzionale – i trasporti ne sono un esempio – ed aree per le quali la sussidiarietà va correttamente interpretata al contrario: non lasciar fare male agli Stati membri quello che può essere fatto meglio a livello europeo. Per queste aree di competenza l’Unione deve aumentare il suo tasso di delivery, deve dimostrare il coraggio della sua utilità.\nOggi l’Unione europea come soluzione intelligente dei problemi della guerra, anche di quella fredda, non basta più: abbiamo bisogno di un’Unione all’altezza delle sfide globali del Terzo millennio.

He highlights the need to reinvent mechanisms for participation and accountability, and warns against the period of reflection resulting in inaction. The speech discusses the importance of delivering tangible results ('delivery'), the need to avoid self-imposed failures in European projects, and the necessity for the EU to demonstrate its utility in areas where it has clear competencies.",

He is critical of passive reflection that leads to inaction and supports increasing EU action in areas of competence, particularly where European-level solutions surpass those of individual member states.",
        "argSum": "The speaker argues that past approaches—elitist decision-making and a lack of citizen engagement—are no longer viable. He asserts that true accountability and the demonstration of the EU's practical benefits ('delivery') are essential for legitimizing the European project. He contends that the reflection period should not lead to paralysis but to active reform and delivery in key areas, warning that failure or inaction undermines the EU's credibility and future.",

He advocates a robust delivery of EU policies, particularly in fields like transport where the EU has clear competence, and calls for subsidiarity to be interpreted in favor of more effective European action.",

It may therefore have come as a surprise that I was appointed to draft the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development in respect of the report on the period of reflection following the rejection of the Constitution. I consider this a sign of the openness with which our Committee approached this issue. The principle of audiatur et altera pars – let the other side be heard – is one of the fundamental preconditions for real dialogue.\nMy views provoked constructive debate in committee, resulting in a compromise that was well thought through, and anything but toothless. The report was endorsed by every member of the Committee, with no votes against, and four abstentions. This demonstrates that dialogue on the future of the Union is possible. Our report in fact advocates principles that are missing from the report of Mr Duff and Mr Voggenhuber. I refer in particular to the principle of legal precaution, by which we should be guided, so that we do not, in the regulations which we approve during the period of reflection, constantly refer to a Constitution that is currently dead from a legal standpoint but which might be resurrected in its original form. It is naïve and misguided to believe that the more often we refer to the Constitution the more we will boost its chances for resuscitation. Such rules may needlessly be undermined at some future point.\nOur Committee’s report also recommends that we enter into cooperation with the institutions of national and regional parliaments, which possess a high degree of qualification and legitimacy, and that we do this more than just once a year for the sake of appearances, as recommended in the report before us today. Unfortunately, there are other parts of the report that strike a discordant note, the most surprising of which is that it sets out what the result of open dialogue ought to be. It evens states that the now dead Constitution is to be ratified in 2009. This is tantamount to trampling over the democratic will of the people of at least two EU Member States. If we are to prescribe the outcome of dialogue in advance, if we reduce dialogue to the level of a stage-managed performance involving unrepresentative bodies, if we continue to spend money in such a way that only the most gratifying opinions are heard, the EU will never have any chance of developing effective structures.",

Považuji to za známku otevřenosti, se kterou náš výbor k problému přistoupil. Princip audiatur et altera pars „nechť je slyšena i druhá strana“ patří k základním podmínkám skutečného dialogu.\nMoje stanovisko založilo ve výboru kreativní debatu a ta vyústila v rozumný kompromis, který přitom nebyl bezzubý. Zpráva byla schváleny všemi členy výboru, nikdo nebyl proti, čtyři se zdrželi. Ukazuje to, že dialog o budoucnosti Unie je možný. V naší zprávě jsou schváleny i principy, které v Duff-Voggenhuberově zprávě postrádám. Je to zejména princip právní opatrnosti, který by nám měl velet, abychom se v normách, které v období reflexe schvalujeme, neodvolávali neustále na Ústavu, která je z právního hlediska v současné době mrtvá a v původní podobě vzkřísitelná. Dětinská víra, že čím častěji budeme Ústavu citovat, tím více přiblížíme naději na její resuscitaci, je zavádějící. Zbytečně to jednou může tyto normy zpochybňovat.\nZpráva našeho výboru rovněž doporučuje, abychom navázali spolupráci s institucemi národních a regionálních parlamentů, kde leží vysoká kvalifikace a také vysoká legitimita, a to nejen okázale a jednou ročně, jak doporučuje zpráva, o které dnes jednáme. Ta bohužel nabízí i jinak odlišný tón. Za nejpřekvapivější považuji, že předem stanovuje, jaký má být výsledek otevřeného dialogu. Prý to má být schválení dnes už mrtvé Ústavy v roce 2009. To je hluboké pohrdání demokratickou vůlí lidu minimálně ve dvou členských zemích Unie. Budeme-li i nadále předepisovat, jaký má být výsledek dialogu, omezíme-li dialog na okázalé akce s nereprezentativní veřejností, budeme-li nadále vynakládat peníze na to, aby byla slyšena jen libě znějící strana, pak není šance na zefektivnění struktur Evropské unie.",

      "english": "Willem Schuth (ALDE), draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development . – (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by congratulating Mr Duff and Mr Voggenhuber on the even-handedness of their report, and that I am very glad to be able, today, to present to you the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on it. This House has had a long fight where codecision in agricultural matters is concerned, and the draft constitution’s incorporation of codecision – which goes back to the Treaties of Amsterdam – in the fields of environmental protection, food safety and the protection of consumers is something to be welcomed. Where agricultural policy is concerned, however, the Council of Agriculture Ministers can still disregard the opinions of the European Parliament, since the codecision procedure is not, under the current Treaty, applicable to the common agricultural policy.\nAlthough the draft constitution, when considered in the light of the above, held out the prospect of increased democratic legitimacy, in that all decisions on agricultural policy were to be subject to codecision, the Agriculture Committee does believe that the existing text is still in need of some improvements. The objectives of the common agricultural policy, as set out in Article III-227, contradict the goals of the European Union described in Article I-3, and no longer serve any readily explainable purpose. They must, as a matter of urgency, be updated to take account of the multifunctional nature of our present agriculture, which provides work for 10 million people in the EU, is the sole guarantor of the sustainable development of rural areas and cannot be considered in isolation from them.\nThis draft constitution is not equal to the task of creating a CAP that is acceptable to society at large, and so one priority for any future treaty must be to extend codecision to the common agricultural policy, and, in particular, to close the loopholes that remain in Articles III-230 (2) and III-231 (2) of the text as it stands at present.\nSince the CAP is so very important and occupies a predominant position in the EU’s Budget, the European public have every right to the highest possible degree of transparency and, above all in this sensitive area, codecision – which, as I see it, can mean nothing other than full codecision for the European Parliament on all matters relating to agricultural policy, consumer protection and the safety of food.",

Zunächst möchte ich den Kollegen Duff und Voggenhuber zu ihrem ausgewogenen Bericht gratulieren. Ich freue mich sehr, dass ich Ihnen heute kurz die Stellungnahme des Ausschusses für Landwirtschaft und ländliche Entwicklung zu diesem Bericht vorstellen darf. Das Europäische Parlament hat im Agrarbereich lange um die Mitentscheidung kämpfen müssen. Es ist zu begrüßen, dass der Verfassungsentwurf die seit den Amsterdamer Verträgen festgeschriebene Mitentscheidung in den Bereichen Umweltschutz, Lebensmittelsicherheit und Verbraucherschutz übernommen hat. Im Bereich der Agrarpolitik kann sich der Rat der Agrarminister bis heute über die Meinung des Europäischen Parlaments hinwegsetzen, da das Mitentscheidungsverfahren nach dem heutigen Vertrag nicht auf die gemeinsame Agrarpolitik Anwendung findet.\nVor diesem Hintergrund stellte der Verfassungsentwurf zwar insofern einen Zugewinn an demokratischer Legitimation in Aussicht, als alle agrarpolitischen Grundsatzentscheidungen der Mitbestimmung unterliegen sollten. Aus Sicht des Landwirtschaftsausschusses bedarf es allerdings noch einiger Verbesserungen am vorliegenden Text. Die in Artikel III-227 genannten Ziele der gemeinsamen Agrarpolitik stehen im Widerspruch zu den in Artikel I-3 formulierten Zielen der Europäischen Union und sind nicht mehr vermittelbar. Sie müssen dringend dahingehend aktualisiert werden, dass sie der Multifunktionalität unserer heutigen Landwirtschaft auch tatsächlich Rechnung tragen. Die Landwirtschaft in der EU bietet heute Arbeitsplätze für 10 Millionen Menschen. Sie ist der einzige Garant für eine nachhaltige Entwicklung des ländlichen Raums und untrennbar mit ihm verbunden.\nFür eine für die Gesellschaft akzeptierbare GAP reicht der vorliegende Verfassungsentwurf nicht aus. Vielmehr sollte im Rahmen eines künftigen Vertrags das Mitentscheidungsverfahren prioritär auf die gemeinsame Agrarpolitik ausgeweitet werden, wobei insbesondere die in den Artikeln III-230 Absatz 2 sowie III-231 Absatz 2 des vorliegenden Textes verbliebenen Lücken im Agrarbereich geschlossen werden könnten.\nAngesichts der großen Bedeutung der GAP und ihrer herausragenden Stellung im Haushalt der EU verdienen die europäischen Bürger ein Höchstmaß an Transparenz und vor allem Mitbestimmung in diesem sensiblen Bereich. Dies kann in meinen Augen nur die volle Mitbestimmung des Europäischen Parlaments in allen Fragen der Agrarpolitik, des Verbraucherschutzes und der Lebensmittelsicherheit bedeuten.",

I hope that that state of affairs is now a thing of the past.\nI have had the honour of drafting the Legal Affairs Committee’s opinion, which is very much in line with the content of this draft report from the lead Committee. The Legal Affairs Committee’s particular concern has been that we should not prematurely abandon the present draft constitution. In the subject areas that really matter to us, such as the composition and powers of the European Court of Justice, the reordering of the lawmaking process and comitology procedure, and judicial cooperation, we simply do not see that a completely new start would enable us to make any real improvements; indeed, it is more likely to have the opposite effect. While I do regret having had to listen today to the Austrian Presidency’s critical views of the powers of the European Court of Justice and the fact that such criticism comes now not only from that source, it does lead me to think that the solutions provided in this draft constitution really are very good after all.\nWe have good legal reasons for objecting to any hasty division of the draft Constitution. Part I contains a very large number of fundamental principles, and we all know that it was only the derogations contained in Part III that made them politically acceptable. We also, albeit with some regret, have good legal reasons for regarding Parts I and III as connected, and no new structure will be possible without fundamental reworking of Part III.\nI will conclude by expressing my grave disappointment with the letter from the three presidents of national parliaments. The sight of many former members of the Convention in this Chamber reminds me of the dedication with which members of the national parliaments worked with us on the draft constitution, of the important proposals they had to make, and, in view of that, I simply cannot regard this letter from the three presidents as being the last word on the subject.",

Ich hoffe, dass diese Zeiten jetzt vorbei sind.\nIch durfte die Stellungnahme des Rechtsausschusses verfassen. Der Tenor der Stellungnahme passt sehr gut zu dem jetzt vorliegenden Berichtsentwurf des federführenden Ausschusses. Uns war es, speziell aus der Sichtweise des Rechtsausschusses, ein Anliegen, uns nicht frühzeitig von dem vorliegenden Verfassungsentwurf zu verabschieden. Bei den Themenbereichen, die uns sehr wichtig sind, wie Stellung und Kompetenzen des Europäischen Gerichtshofes, Neuordnung des Legislativverfahrens und des Komitologieverfahrens, Zusammenarbeit im justiziellen Bereich, können wir einfach nicht sehen, dass wir durch einen kompletten Neubeginn wirklich Verbesserungen erreichen können – ganz im Gegenteil! Wenn ich heute leider von der österreichischen Ratspräsidentschaft Kritik an der Kompetenz des Europäischen Gerichtshofes hören musste und es jetzt nicht nur von der österreichischen Präsidentschaft Kritik gibt, dann denke ich, dass die Lösungen, die hier im Verfassungsentwurf gefunden worden sind, doch sehr gut sind.\nAus rechtlicher Sicht verwahren wir uns natürlich auch gegen eine leichtfertige Teilung des Verfassungsentwurfs. Im Teil I haben wir sehr viele Grundsätze. Wir alle wissen, dass diese Grundsätze nur mit den Ausnahmen, die in Teil III enthalten sind, politisch akzeptabel waren. Auch aus rechtlicher Sicht müssten wir leider Teil I und Teil III in verbundener Weise sehen, und ohne grundsätzliche Überarbeitung des Teils III werden wir hier keine neue Struktur erreichen können.\nDarf ich abschließend noch meine große Enttäuschung über das Schreiben dieser drei Präsidenten nationaler Parlamente zum Ausdruck bringen.

What does this opinion say? First of all, it points out all the improvements provided for by the Constitution in relation to the current Treaties. The improvements in terms of security, liberty and justice were many and significant and, above all, they were the subject of consensus on the part of the nations comprising Europe.\nI am not going to list them all, but I shall simply mention four points that are likely to get us over this bad patch and that the excellent report by my colleagues, Mr Duff and Mr Voggenhuber has put back on the agenda.\nFirstly, the widespread introduction of qualified majority voting and the simplification of the legislative acts enable us to devise a policy rather than be thwarted by the finer points of such a policy. Next, the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, which is a factory of Community law when Parliament is at a loss, is extended. The definitive strengthening of Parliament’s role as co-legislator might also be mentioned, this being something that we need to promote. Finally, integrating the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the very wording of the Constitution confers legal value upon the latter. There are, of course, other positive points, but those I have just listed are genuinely fundamental.\nForgive my alluding to these possibilities still open to us, but I wanted to emphasise the advances entailed by this Constitution in an area not discussed throughout the EU Member States, namely that of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the area of freedom, justice and security. Therein lies, indeed, the material for constructing a framework right now, pending the advent of a new document. Why, therefore, do the Member States not take more advantage of this material in order to try to bind together again an EU that is being given a rough ride?\nFinally, we consider it a matter of priority systematically to take account of the impact of EU policies on fundamental rights and, so that we might not delay in presenting an initial bill, we emphasise how urgent it is to set up an independent Agency for Fundamental Rights, as requested by Parliament on 26 May 2005.",

Que dit cet avis? Tout d'abord, il rappelle toutes les améliorations prévues par la Constitution par rapport aux traités en vigueur. Les améliorations en matière de sécurité, de liberté et de justice étaient nombreuses et significatives et surtout, elles faisaient l'objet du consensus des nations qui composent l'Europe.\nJe ne vais pas les rappeler toutes mais je mentionnerai simplement quatre points susceptibles de nous sortir de la mauvaise passe que nous traversons et que l'excellent rapport de mes collègues, M. Duff et M. Voggenhuber remet à l'ordre du jour.\nD'abord, la généralisation du vote à la majorité qualifiée et la simplification des actes normatifs nous permettent d'établir une politique et non pas d'être bloqués par ses nuances. Ensuite, l'extension de la juridiction de la Cour de justice, fabrique du droit communautaire quand le Parlement ne sait pas en faire. Citons encore le renforcement définitif du rôle du Parlement en tant que colégislateur; nous devons en être les promoteurs. Enfin, l'intégration de la charte des droits fondamentaux dans le texte même de la Constitution confère à celle-ci une valeur juridique. Il y a naturellement d'autres points positifs mais ceux que je viens d'énumérer sont vraiment fondamentaux.\nPardonnez-moi cette allusion à ces possibilités qui nous restent, mais je voulais souligner les avancées que comportait cette Constitution dans un domaine qui est indiscuté dans l'ensemble des pays membres de l'Union, à savoir celui de la charte des droits fondamentaux et de l'espace de liberté, justice et sécurité. Il y a là en effet de quoi fabriquer dès à présent une ossature, en attendant qu'un nouveau texte surgisse. Pourquoi donc les États membres ne s'en saisissent-ils pas davantage pour essayer de recimenter une Union qui est malmenée?\nEnfin, nous considérons comme prioritaire la prise en compte systématique de l'impact des politiques de l'Union sur les droits fondamentaux et nous soulignons l'urgence de créer, afin de poser sans attendre un premier acte, une Agence indépendante des droits fondamentaux, comme le Parlement l'a demandé le 26 mai dernier.",

Seldom do we discuss more important issues than the one we are discussing now. Our thanks should go to the rapporteurs who have taken the initiative and, on the basis of broad-ranging discussions, have presented this topic.\nThe future of Europe is our common problem, equally important for the young and the elderly, for men and women. As Mrs Wallström has emphasised, most European citizens see no problem in the decision-making mechanisms of the European institutions. Their problem is primarily a lack of clarity in the vision they have of their own future, their prospects, their security and the new challenges which they are still struggling to find a response to.\nUncertainty and fear of the future were clearly the main factors behind the NO outcome in the votes on the Constitution. Clearly, we are all responsible for finding a way forwards. Those of us here at the European Parliament should be aware of the messages and signals we are sending out when we take decisions, for instance, on cohesion instruments or the transfer of pension rights or when we give preferential treatment to migrants from third countries rather than to the citizens of new Member States.\nThe governments of Member States must bear their share of responsibility for frequently behaving as if European matters, such as the work-life balance goals formulated in the Lisbon Strategy, do not concern them. A fundamental question remains as to whether we will be able to develop a sufficiently appealing common vision and as to whether our European values will be strong enough to produce an adequate level of social cohesion.\nMr President, women account for more than [half] of all European citizens and voters. They have their own specific problems, which call for a sensitive approach and satisfactory solutions. The views of women should therefore be accorded sufficiently serious consideration in the forthcoming debate. Mr President, I would like to emphasise in conclusion that, in the opinion of the Committee for Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, a repeat of the split between the core countries of Europe and the remaining ones would be one of the worst possible outcomes of our efforts to find a way forwards.",

Vďaka patrí spravodajcom, ktorí veľmi iniciatívne, na základe širokej diskusie, túto tému nastolili.\nBudúcnosť Európy je náš spoločný problém, ktorý je rovnako dôležitý pre mladých a starších, pre mužov a ženy. Európski občania väčšinou nemajú problém, tak ako pani Wallström zdôraznila, s rozhodovacími mechanizmami európskych inštitúcií. Problém majú predovšetkým s nejasnou víziou o vlastnej budúcnosti, o vlastných životných perspektívach, o istotách, o nových výzvach, na ktoré zatiaľ ťažko hľadajú odpoveď.\nPráve neistota a strach z budúcnosti boli zrejme hlavné dôvody, ktoré viedli k hlasovaniu proti ústave. Svoju zodpovednosť pri hľadaní východiska máme zrejme všetci. Aj my tu v Európskom parlamente si musíme byť vedomí toho, aké posolstvo, aké signály vysielame, keď napríklad rozhodujeme o nástrojoch kohézie, o prenose dôchodkových práv alebo keď uprednostňujeme migrantov z tretích krajín pred občanmi nových členských štátov.\nSvoju zodpovednosť majú aj vlády členských štátov, ktoré sa často správajú tak, ako keby sa ich európske záležitosti, napríklad ciele vytýčené v Lisabonskej stratégii, v zosúlaďovaní pracovného a rodinného života, ani netýkali. Základnou otázkou naďalej zostáva to, či nájdeme spoločnú víziu, ktorá bude dostatočne príťažlivá, a či naše európske hodnoty sú dostatočne silné na to, aby vytvorili primeranú sociálnu kohéziu.\nPán predseda viac ako európskych občanov, európskych voličov, tvoria ženy. Majú svoje špeciálne problémy, ktoré potrebujú citlivý prístup a primerané riešenia. Hlas žien v nasledujúcej diskusii by sa preto mal brať dostatočne vážne. Pán predseda, na záver by som rada zdôraznila, že Výbor pre práva žien a rovnosť pohlaví je toho názoru, že jedným z najhorších výsledkov hľadania východiska by bolo opätovné rozdelenie Európy na jadrové krajiny a ostatné.",

The other view is to say: wait a minute, this text has actually now been ratified by a majority of Member States. The heads of government themselves in the European Council did not declare it dead, they extended the period of ratification and opened a period of reflection. In that period of reflection we must listen to those who said ‘no’, but we must also listen to the majority who have said ‘yes’ and find a way forward that can ultimately bring the two together.\nThis report achieves a synthesis of those two viewpoints. It says that it is too soon to conclude now; the period of reflection must be extended at least until 2007. Until then we need to keep all options open. We need longer and deeper reflection. Of course – as is to be expected – we say that this Parliament would prefer to maintain the text, but we recognise that that would only be possible if measures were taken to reassure and convince public opinion.

We were convinced that the EU needed the constitutional framework. We considered the Constitutional Treaty to be an efficient tool for moving the EU forward and for giving it the political dimension and social perspective that are both necessary. We have not changed our opinion, and we do not think that the Constitution should be declared defunct before we have examined it for signs of life. Otherwise, it will be impossible to declare that the patient is dead.\nNor, however, can the fact be ignored that, during the process of ratification, a disjunction appeared between the desire for deeper integration, demonstrated by the European elites, and the feelings of a section of European society. This disjunction is not only of relevance to the two countries that refused to ratify the draft Constitution. It is a serious problem.\nJean Monnet used to say that, faced with a serious problem, its context sometimes has to be changed. That is precisely the purpose of the period of reflection. The great public debate on the future of the European Union should create a new context for the European constitutional enterprise. It is for the European Parliament to define the framework and the arrangements for these debates, to have the national parliaments and civil society take part in them, to specify the questions and to draw up the necessary agenda. It is in that way that it will be possible for the European forum to appear, and to do so in the form of a public space for Europe. We must not decide just yet on the future of the document. That time will come after the period of reflection, after the European debate and after having changed the context. The report presented to us states this very well.",

The European Union needs a democratic Constitution and cannot just stumble along with Nice. The debate that must take place on the Constitution has to be a European debate, and the letter sent by the three presidents of national parliaments shows that responsibility for the debate cannot be left at national level, but that there is a need for a truly European body, like this Parliament, to conduct it and – all right, yes, we must say it openly – to steer it as well.\nTwo things are missing in the report, however, and we hope to be able to introduce them with the vote in this House. In fact, Mr Corbett, I do not agree with you: it is absolutely not true that the movement of those who voted ‘yes’ to the Constitution is split between those who now want to get rid of the text and those who want to keep it. It is not like that. The amendment that we shall put to the vote tomorrow explicitly states that one possibility – not a theoretical one, but a practical one – might be to change the text and that, if that were to happen, it would require a new constitutional process, which might also end with a referendum.\nTo think, however, that the only proposal that we, as the European Parliament, should put forward is to maintain the current text and nothing else is false and short-sighted, and it is that attitude that might really divide the pro-European movement, that is to say the movement that obtained broad support for the Constitution in this House, with 500 votes.\nI therefore believe that the two amendments tabled by the rapporteurs should be supported by a large majority in this Parliament, because they simply state that it is possible to debate various options. Perhaps no option is better than the others, but I believe that they should all be discussed, including the one that right now sounds strangely drastic, which is that we should reopen the debate on the Constitution with the citizens as well.\n(Applause)",

Il dibattito che dovrà svolgersi intorno alla Costituzione deve essere un dibattito europeo e la lettera stessa dei tre presidenti dei parlamenti dimostra che non si può lasciare la responsabilità della discussione a livello nazionale e che c’è bisogno di un organo davvero europeo, come il Parlamento, per condurlo. Ebbene sì, dobbiamo dirlo in modo non timido, anche guidarlo.\nNella relazione mancano però due elementi, che speriamo di riuscire a introdurre con la votazione in Aula. Infatti, onorevole Corbett, io non sono d’accordo con lei: non è assolutamente vero che il fronte di coloro che hanno votato “sì” alla Costituzione è stato diviso tra coloro che ora vogliono uccidere il testo e coloro invece che lo vogliono mantenere. Non è così. Nell’emendamento che sottoporremo alla votazione di domani si dice esplicitamente che una possibilità – non teorica, ma pratica – potrebbe consistere nella modifica del testo e che, se questo dovesse succedere, si impone un nuovo processo costituzionale, che si potrebbe anche concludersi con un referendum.\nPensare, invece, che l’unica proposta che noi dobbiamo formulare, come Parlamento europeo, sia quella di sostenere esclusivamente l’attuale testo, è illusorio e miope ed è ciò che potrebbe veramente dividere il fronte proeuropeo, cioè il fronte che in questa, con cinquecento voti, ha ottenuto un ampio sostegno per la Costituzione.\nRitengo pertanto che i due emendamenti presentati dai relatori debbano essere sostenuti da un’ampia maggioranza di questo Parlamento, perché affermano semplicemente la possibilità di discutere varie opzioni. Nessuna opzione è forse migliore delle altre, ma credo che tutte debbano essere discusse, compresa quella che in questo momento risulta stranamente così drammatica, ossia che si debba riaprire la discussione con i cittadini anche sulla Costituzione.\n(Applausi)",

For example, the two co-rapporteurs of the resolution we are now debating did not consider it appropriate this time to describe the majority of the electorate in France and the Netherlands with the unkind epithets that some levelled at them a few months ago.\nI would therefore like to thank Mr Voggenhuber and Mr Duff for emphasising here, at least in their resolution, that the citizens have in fact, and I quote, 'expressed concerns and worries which need to be taken into account', and that we need to respect their decision and 'to analyse carefully the reasons for the negative results'. That is a step forward. This would be even clearer if the report stated that the draft treaty is now dead and that the debate now centres on what should replace it. My group is prepared to take an active part in the debate on the future of the Union with our fellow citizens. As regards the topics put forward for those discussions, we agree with them in essence.\nThe question that arises is this: what will be the political result of this debate? How far are you prepared to go in transforming the policies and structures of the EU as it is, in order to meet the demands being made by most of Europe's societies, which were demonstrated most spectacularly by the rejection of the constitutional treaty? That is where the problem lies. The report now before us proposes only, and I quote, 'to reassure … public opinion', given that, and again I quote, 'in any case … the Constitution enters into force during 2009'. In that case, it is no longer a debate, but a communication campaign.\nIt would be a shame if we followed that route. It would be a missed opportunity. That is why my group, almost without exception, will not go down that path.",

Ainsi, les deux corapporteurs de la résolution dont nous débattons n'ont-ils pas estimé opportun de reprendre aujourd'hui, pour juger la majorité des électrices et des électeurs français et néerlandais, les qualificatifs peu amènes dont certains les avaient gratifiés il y a quelques mois.\nMerci donc à M. Voggenhuber et à M. Duff de souligner cette fois, du moins dans leur résolution, que ces citoyens ont en fait, je vous cite, «exprimé des préoccupations et des inquiétudes dont il faut tenir compte, qu'il convient de respecter leur décision et d'analyser avec soin les causes de ces résultats défavorables». C'est une avancée. Ce serait encore plus clair si le rapport précisait que ce projet de traité est désormais caduc et que le débat porte à présent sur ce qui doit le remplacer. Mon groupe est prêt à s'inscrire activement dans le débat sur l'avenir de l'Union avec nos concitoyens. Quant aux thèmes proposés pour cette confrontation d'idées, ils nous conviennent pour l'essentiel.\nLa question posée est la suivante: quel sera le débouché politique de ce débat? À quelles transformations profondes des orientations et des structures de l'actuelle Union êtes-vous prêts, pour répondre aux exigences qui montent de la plupart des sociétés européennes et dont le rejet du traité constitutionnel a été le révélateur le plus spectaculaire? C'est là que le bât blesse. Le rapport qui nous est soumis ne propose, je cite, «que de rassurer l'opinion publique», étant entendu, je le cite encore, «qu'en tout état de cause, la Constitution entrerait en vigueur en 2009». Dès lors, il ne s'agit plus d'un débat, mais d'une campagne de communication.\nSuivre cette orientation serait dommage. Ce serait une occasion manquée.

That is just as important to me, which does not mean one should not take the ‘no’s’ into consideration, for they also send out a strong message we should take into account. That is only a negative message, though, one that does not offer an alternative, whilst, paradoxically, the fear that this ‘no’ expresses would probably be best allayed in a European Constitution, in a European response.\nIndeed, as the Commissioner was right to point out, looking at Eurobarometer, we notice that the citizens know very well that a number of cross-border problems require a European response and ‘more Europe’. I particularly have the second and third pillars in mind, which is mainly what the Constitution would have catered for. Another paradox is that during the referendum debates, the strengthening of this political Europe was virtually overlooked in the second and third pillars.\nI do think that it is indeed now time to actively use the period of reflection provided for by the Commission’s plan D. We should, in other words, take all the time we need and not rush into anything. That is why I endorse the report that is before us now, because it points in that direction, although I fear that certain amendments which the rapporteurs have re-tabled seem to favour the short cuts and draw conclusions prematurely.

Dit is voor mij al even belangrijk, wat niet wil zeggen dat je niet met de \"neen's\" rekening moet houden, zij geven ook een heel duidelijk signaal waarmee we rekening moeten houden.

      "english": "Carlos Carnero González (PSE). – (ES) Mr President, I would like to remind the Commissioner and certain fellow Members that, twenty years ago, Spain joined the European Union. It was good news for my country and surely for the whole of the Union. I say this because we Spanish joined twenty years ago and a little more than a year ago we held a referendum and voted ‘yes’ to the European Constitution, with the same rights, duties and responsibilities with which other countries, France and the Netherlands, voted ‘no’. A ‘yes’ is worth the same as a ‘no’, whether expressed by referendum or by a parliament. And today an absolute majority of members of the Union have said yes to the European Constitution.\nThis report – I have had the opportunity to work with its two rapporteurs for four months, as shadow rapporteur for the Socialist Group – is a balanced result, which essentially says four things:\nFirstly, this Parliament still considers the Constitution to be the best instrument for creating a more democratic and effective Union.\nSecondly, if it does not enter into force, the Union’s political and institutional problems will worsen, not just persist, and furthermore it will be impossible to carry out more enlargements on the basis of the Treaty of Nice following the entry of Bulgaria and Rumania.\nThirdly, we must begin a genuine period of reflection and debate, amongst the institutions and with the citizens, in order to seek solutions to the current crisis. At the end of this period we will have to draw conclusions that allow us to move forward and complete the political union.\nFourthly, to be consistent with how we acted in January 2005, a positive result from this period of reflection would be to maintain the current text, which would only be possible with the appropriate measures. We shall then define the appropriate measures.\nGiven the current political context, we can say that there are new elements on the basis of which we can move ahead with the Constitution and refute two positions: firstly, the statement that the Constitution is dead – well, reports of its death have been grossly exaggerated – and, secondly, the idea that we must first deal with unemployment, immigration or fighting crime, a view which ignores the fact that, in order to do so, we need this Constitution. This is not just an issue for institutionalists.\n(Applause)",

Digo esto porque los españoles entramos hace veinte años y hace poco más de un año votamos en referéndum y votamos «sí» a la Constitución Europea, con los mismos derechos, deberes y responsabilidades con los que otros países, Francia y Holanda, votaron «no». Los síes y los noes valen igual, expresados en referéndum o expresados vía parlamentaria. Y hoy la mayoría absoluta de los socios de la Unión han dicho sí a la Constitución Europea.\nEste informe –he tenido la ocasión de trabajar con sus dos ponentes, en tanto que ponente alternativo del Grupo Socialista, durante cuatro meses– es un resultado equilibrado, que dice cuatro cosas esencialmente:\nEn primer lugar, este Parlamento sigue considerando la Constitución como el mejor instrumento para obtener una Unión más democrática y más eficaz.\nEn segundo lugar, si no entra en vigor, los problemas políticos e institucionales de la Unión se agravarán, no solo persistirán, y, además, será imposible llevar a cabo más ampliaciones sobre la base del Tratado de Niza tras el ingreso de Bulgaria y Rumanía.\nEn tercer lugar, tenemos que abrir un auténtico periodo de reflexión y debate, entre las instituciones y con la ciudadanía, para buscar soluciones a la crisis actual. Será al término de ese periodo cuando tengamos que sacar conclusiones que nos permitan seguir hacia adelante y culminar la unión política.\nY, en cuarto lugar, en coherencia con lo que hicimos en enero de 2005, un resultado positivo de ese periodo de reflexión sería el mantenimiento del texto actual, lo que solo sería posible con las medidas adecuadas. Definiremos entonces las medidas adecuadas.\nHoy el contexto político nos permite decir que hay elementos nuevos para seguir adelante con la Constitución y desmentir dos cuestiones: en primer lugar, la afirmación de que la Constitución está muerta –los muertos que vos matáis gozan de buena salud– y, en segundo lugar, la de que primero hay que ocuparse del paro, la inmigración o la lucha contra la criminalidad, olvidando que, para hacerlo, hace falta tener esta Constitución. Este no es un tema solo de institucionalistas.\n(Aplausos)",

The key issues discussed are the need for a structured period of reflection, the risks of unresolved political and institutional challenges if the Constitution does not take effect, and the importance of engaging both institutions and citizens in the debate.",
        "positionSum": "The speaker strongly supports regarding the Constitution as the optimal instrument for making the EU more democratic and effective. He emphasizes the need to maintain commitment to the Constitutional process and argues for a genuine period of reflection as a means to resolve the current crisis.",

He contends that further enlargement cannot be effectively managed under the existing Nice Treaty framework and asserts that having a Constitution is necessary to address broader issues such as unemployment, immigration, and crime.",
        "propSum": "The speaker proposes opening a true period of reflection and debate involving both EU institutions and citizens to seek solutions to the crisis. He suggests that, ideally, this period should result in reaffirming the current Constitutional Treaty, contingent on identifying and implementing suitable measures.",

To it I would add that this Treaty represents the beginning of the end for an enlarged Union of citizens. What, after all, is Nice all about? It is about there being no fundamental rights binding in law, no citizens’ initiatives, no clear demarcation of powers, no full budgetary rights for the European Parliament, right of national parliaments to intervene in response to proposals from the Commission, no parliamentary control of Europol, no foreign minister and no European diplomatic service.\nThe list of all the things that Europe stands to lose without a constitution is a very long one; there must be no march back to the past. Are we then to say, in all seriousness, that Nice must be cast in concrete? I do not want the European Union to degenerate into a free trade zone with limited social liability; a core Europe that draws new dividing lines across Europe is unacceptable, and so the constitutional process must go on. Europe needs a new Treaty. The one thing that is blindingly clear is that ‘as you were’ will get us nowhere.\nPeople’s worries and problems must, at last, be taken seriously – that is the message that comes over, loud and clear, from the French and Dutch referenda on the Constitution. What we need is a political shift in the European Union, in the shape of a move towards a social Europe.

Keine rechtsverbindlichen Grundrechte, keine Bürgerinitiativen, keine klare Abgrenzung der Kompetenzen, kein volles Haushaltsrecht für das Europäische Parlament, kein Interventionsrecht der nationalen Parlamente gegenüber Kommissionsvorschlägen, keine parlamentarische Kontrolle von Europol, kein Außenminister und kein Europäischer Diplomatischer Dienst.\nDie Liste all dessen, was Europa ohne Verfassung zu verlieren hat, ist sehr lang. Einen Marsch zurück in die Vergangenheit darf es nicht geben! Soll denn Nizza ernsthaft in Beton gegossen werden? Ich will nicht, dass die Europäische Union zu einer Freihandelszone mit beschränkter sozialer Haftung verkommt. Ein Kerneuropa, das neue Trennlinien in Europa aufreißt, ist inakzeptabel. Deshalb muss der Verfassungsprozess weitergehen. Europa braucht einen neuen Vertrag. Nur eines ist vollkommen klar: Mit einem bloßen „Weiter so“ wird dies nicht gelingen.\nDie Sorgen und Probleme der Menschen müssen endlich ernst genommen werden.

This House is not reflecting on the future of Europe, but a strategy for getting the twice rejected Constitution ratified after all. All of this, of course, under the guise of considerable measures to put the mind of public opinion at rest.\nAgainst the backdrop of these transparent attempts to ignore the express will of the French and Dutch electorate, I should nevertheless like to express my appreciation for a number of amendments tabled by both rapporteurs. They, at any rate, are not obsessively holding onto the present Constitution; they also appear to have understood the ‘no’ in France and the Netherlands better than the Members of the large groups and they also display a greater willingness to really look at the issues.\nI heard my dear fellow Member, Mr Voggenhuber, speak about nationalism.

Dit huis bezint zich niet op de toekomst van Europa, maar op een strategie om de tweevoudig afgewezen Grondwet alsnog geratificeerd te krijgen. Dit alles natuurlijk onder de dekmantel van aanzienlijke maatregelen om de publieke opinie gerust te stellen.\nTegenover deze doorzichtige pogingen de uitdrukkelijke wil van het Franse en Nederlandse electoraat te negeren, wil ik mijn waardering toch uitspreken voor een aantal van de amendementen van de beide rapporteurs. Zij houden in ieder geval niet obsessief vast aan de huidige Grondwet. Bovendien lijken zij het ‘nee’ in Frankrijk en Nederland beter begrepen te hebben dan mijn collega's van de grote fracties en tonen zij een grotere bereidheid tot werkelijk reflectie.\nVoorzitter, ik heb mijn geachte collega Voggenhuber horen spreken over nationalisme.

In the eyes of many European citizens the EU spends its time discussing bananas, the shape of a carrot and solar radiation levels, but not the issues that relate to the everyday life of European citizens. Seven out of ten citizens in Slovakia know very little about the EU and its structure. Citizens view the Union as something distant from their daily problems. It came as a shock that more people cast their votes in a recent Big Brother reality TV show than during the elections to the European Parliament.\nMass media play an important and crucial role in informing European citizens. Citizens are interested in the EU and want information on how it functions. The mass media should begin to inform them about the work of European institutions and the ways in which their decisions can affect everyday life. For this to happen, however, the right conditions need to be in place. I can appreciate that a journalist may find it difficult to explain draft legislation containing thousands of amendments, especially if the text is published just a few days before voting takes place and is not, for that matter, published in all languages. If the media are to inform citizens objectively about the work of the EU, they must focus on genuine work rather than titbits or scandals. At the same time, however, we must create the conditions for citizens to become better informed; we must eliminate the complex nature of European legislation and restrict the number of debates taking place behind closed doors.",

I believe that languages are a vehicle for communication rather than for isolation.\nI believe, Mr President, that this report makes three important points. Mr Dehaene and Mr Stubb have already said some important things on this issue, but there are three points that I would like to mention.\nFirstly, this Constitution is the result of a consensus and, until we have an alternative menu, this is what we have. And it is a good consensus because those people who have voted ‘no’ in certain countries of the European Union are incapable of having a coffee together or of producing an alternative text. That is the reality. Those who say ‘no’ are people who reject but do not build. They are not proposing anything. Until there is another menu on the table, I shall stick to this menu and this Parliament will stick to this menu.\nSecondly, we are against the partial application of aspects of the Constitution. Why? For the same reason: because the Constitution is the result of a consensus and we are not all in agreement with all of it, but we agree with it as a whole and we would not therefore accept − and this Parliament is right to state this in its report − the idea of taking one thing but not another. We agree with everything as a whole but we do not agree with cherry-picking .\nThirdly, this Parliament states in this report that there will not be any new enlargements of the European Union without a Constitution, and it has good reason. We are aware that the Union will not operate, either in democratic terms or in terms of efficiency, without the provisions laid down in the Constitution. This appears in Article 49 of the current Treaties, Mr President, and I address this to our ostrich friends, because this Parliament must give its opinion on any enlargement of the European Union and, through this report, this Parliament is making a very clear and solemn commitment: there will be no enlargements without a Constitution.",

Mis colegas Dehaene y Stubb ya han dicho cosas importantes sobre este tema, pero hay tres puntos que quiero señalar.\nEn primer lugar, esta Constitución es fruto de un consenso y, mientras no haya un menú alternativo, esto es lo que tenemos. Y es un buen consenso porque los que han votado «no» en algún país de la Unión Europea son incapaces de tomar un café juntos, incapaces de producir un texto alternativo. Esa es la realidad. Los del «no» son gente que rechaza pero no construye, no propone nada. En tanto en cuanto no haya otro menú sobre la mesa, yo estoy con este menú y este Parlamento está con este menú.\nEn segundo lugar, estamos en contra de la aplicación parcial de aspectos de la Constitución. ¿Por qué? Por la misma idea, porque la Constitución es fruto de un consenso y todos no estamos de acuerdo con todo, pero estamos de acuerdo con la globalidad y, por tanto, no aceptaríamos −y hace bien este Parlamento en decirlo en este informe− coger esto pero no aquello. Estamos de acuerdo con todo pero no en hacer el cherry picking.\nEn tercer lugar, este Parlamento dice en este informe que no habrá nuevas ampliaciones de la Unión Europea sin Constitución, y no es una casualidad. Nosotros somos conscientes de que la Unión no funcionará, ni democráticamente ni eficazmente, sin las prescripciones que establece la Constitución. Eso está en el artículo 49 de los Tratados actuales, señor Presidente, y se lo digo a los amigos de los avestruces, porque este Parlamento tiene que pronunciarse sobre cualquier ampliación de la Unión Europea y con este informe este Parlamento adopta un compromiso muy claro y muy solemne: no habrá ampliaciones si no hay Constitución.",

The Duff/Voggenhuber report has sparked lively debates, and is as such part of Commissioner Wallström’s Plan D.\nWhat has come out of our deliberations is, then, something very encouraging: the overwhelming majority in this House holds fast to the European constitution. Far from disappearing, the reasons for the new European treaty have become more pressing: greater effectiveness, more transparency, more democracy. All the reforms and advances that the constitution brings with it are urgently needed. The debates in the Netherlands and France have done nothing to consign them to oblivion. I am very glad that the Austrian Presidency is breathing new life into this debate. Over the last few months, we have been in some sense paralysed. What we need for 2006 is a wide-ranging debate in all twenty-five countries, and I can tell the President of the Council and the Vice-President that I hope all twenty-five of them will make their contribution. I have seen the interim report from the December summit; it left a great deal to be desired. In most of the Member States, the debate has not even begun yet, and so it would be quite wrong, now, in January 2006, to present the results of a debate even before we have had one. What we have to do now is spend a year discussing the great issues of European policy with all the stakeholders in all the Member States, and then we will be able, in 2007, to come to conclusions as to which procedure we opt for to bring this project to a successful conclusion. There are various options available to us; my country’s Chancellor has asked why we do not extend the constitution by adding on to it a protocol on the social Europe, and that is a way forward that we should discuss.\nThis period of reflection will endow us, and European democracy, with new strength. We have every chance of coming out of this crisis in better condition than we were in when it started.\n(Applause)",

Im Gegenteil, sie werden von Tag zu Tag immer dringender. Mehr Handlungsfähigkeit, mehr Transparenz, mehr Demokratie. Alle Reformen und alle Fortschritte, die die Verfassung bringt, sind dringend notwendig. Sie sind nicht durch die Debatte in den Niederlanden oder in Frankreich entfallen. Ich bin sehr froh, dass die österreichische Präsidentschaft diese Debatte wiederbelebt. Wir hatten in den letzten Monaten eine Art Lähmung. Wir brauchen im Jahre 2006 eine umfassende Debatte in allen 25 Ländern, und ich hoffe, Herr Ratspräsident und Frau Vizepräsidentin, dass auch alle 25 Länder ihre Beiträge liefern. Ich habe den Zwischenbericht des Gipfels vom Dezember gesehen. Das war sehr dürftig. In der Mehrheit der Länder hat die Debatte noch gar nicht begonnen. Deshalb wäre es völlig falsch, schon jetzt im Januar 2006 die Ergebnisse einer Debatte zu präsentieren, bevor man überhaupt begonnen hat. Wir müssen jetzt ein Jahr lang in allen Ländern auf allen Ebenen mit allen Akteuren die großen Fragen der Europapolitik diskutieren. Dann kann man 2007 Schlussfolgerungen ziehen, welches Verfahren wir wählen, um dieses Projekt erfolgreich zu Ende zu führen. Dazu gibt es verschiedene Optionen. Meine Kanzlerin hat gesagt: Warum nicht die Verfassung verlängern, indem wir ein Protokoll über das soziale Europa oder das Europa der Identitäten anhängen? Das ist ein Weg, den wir diskutieren sollten.\nDiese Phase der Reflexion wird uns stärker machen, und sie wird die Europäische Demokratie stärken.

      "english": "Jules Maaten (ALDE). – (NL) Mr President, the Constitutional Treaty is dead, long live the Treaty. Although it is true that the Constitutional Treaty has been rejected more on account of context than text, it is also true that the text of the Constitutional Treaty proved too weak to solve the problems in context. It lacked a sufficient number of bold and engaging ideas.\nWhy do we not give the citizens real power and get them to directly elect the President of the Commission, for example, or create the possibility of a European collective referendum – so not 25 or 27 small referendums, but a true European referendum – or why do we not create a truly European political space, in other words a European res publica ?\nWith regard to context, the Dutch citizens – like, I assume, those in most other Member States too – do not in any event want to discuss the institutions for the moment, thank you very much. What they do want is a Europe that becomes competitive, creates jobs, combats terrorism and cross-border crime, that pursues proper external policy, and that, at long last, simply does what it is expected to do. If we do not succeed, then, breathing new life into a Treaty review is like flogging a dead horse and all talk then becomes academic.\nCertainly, we need a new Treaty in order to make Europe more democratic and more efficient, but there is no rush. Some of the many excellent ideas which our rapporteurs have floated are intended to extend the period of reflection to late-2007, to keep more options open and also in general, I welcome a method to indicate how we should hold the debate. What we do not need, though, is a document entitled ‘Constitution’ which frightens people off rather than involving them. After all, a rose smells just as sweetly under another name. As a result, holding onto the name and the text for dear life is for my group an insuperable problem.\nIf the solution is to submit an improved text – and I truly hope we will succeed in this, for it is important – then I am in favour of submitting it to all European citizens in a referendum, to coincide with the next European elections.",

Het is wel waar, het Grondwetsverdrag is verworpen vanwege de context meer dan vanwege de tekst, maar het is ook waar dat de tekst van het Grondwetsverdrag te zwak is gebleken om de problemen met de context op te lossen. Er zaten onvoldoende of geen gedurfde en aansprekende ideeën in.\nWaarom geven we de burgers toch geen echte invloed en laten we ze, bijvoorbeeld, de voorzitter van de Europese Commissie direct verkiezen, of scheppen we de mogelijkheid van een Europees collectief referendum? Dus, niet vijfentwintig of zevenentwintig kleine referenda, maar één echt Europees referendum. Oftewel, waarom scheppen we niet echt een Europese politieke ruimte, jawel een Europese res publica?\nMaar dan over die context. De burgers in mijn land Nederland - maar ik vermoed ook in de meest andere lidstaten - willen in elk geval even niet over de instituties praten; dank u vriendelijk. Wat ze wel willen is een Europa dat concurrerend wordt, dat banen schept, dat optreedt tegen terrorisme en tegen grensoverschrijdende misdaad, dat een behoorlijk buitenlands beleid voert, dat gewoon zijn werk eindelijk eens doet. Als dat niet lukt, dan is het proberen een Verdragsherziening nieuw leven in te blazen, trekken aan een dood paard en dan praten we in het ijle.\nZeker, wij hebben een nieuw verdrag nodig om Europa democratischer en efficiënter te maken, maar wij hebben geen haast. De vele uitstekende ideeën waar onze rapporteurs mee zijn gekomen, zijn onder meer om de reflectieperiode langer te laten duren en wel tot eind 2007, meerdere opties open te houden, en ook in het algemeen een benadering over hoe we het debat moeten voeren vind ik uitstekend. Maar wat we niet nodig hebben is een document dat Grondwet heet. Dat heeft mensen afgeschrikt, in plaats van ze erbij te betrekken; een roos ruikt bovendien net zo lekker als je deze een andere naam heeft. Het krampachtig en halsstarrig vasthouden aan de naam en de tekst is voor mijn partij dan ook een onoverkomelijk probleem.\nAls de oplossing is, een verbeterde tekst voor te leggen - en ik hoop werkelijk dat ons dat lukt, want het is belangrijk - dan ben ik er een voorstander van om deze inderdaad tegelijk met de volgende Europese verkiezingen in een referendum aan alle Europese burgers voor te leggen.",

Különösen a nagyobb átláthatóság és a Parlament ellenőrző szerepének a növekedése vagy éppen a kisebbségek jogainak az európai védelme területén.\nA kialakult válságnak azonban nem az a fő oka, hogy az Unió jövőbeli működését jobban szabályozó Alkotmány miről beszél, hanem az, hogy az Unió teljesítménye sok polgár szemében nem megfelelő és nem meggyőző. Az Uniót működtető intézmények és elitek elveszítették a polgárok egy részének a bizalmát.\nEgyetértek az Európai Bizottságnak a véleményével, és amint elfogadott módosító indítványomban is megfogalmaztam, fontos, hogy a mérlegelési időszaknak az is célja legyen, hogy hogyan szerezze vissza az Európai Unió az állampolgárok bizalmát. Úgy véljük, hogy a siker érdekében vita kell arról is, hogy hogyan fokozza az Európai Unió a teljesítményét, és hogyan járuljon hozzá az emberek valós problémáinak a megoldásához.\nAz alkotmányos szerződést, vagy annak legfontosabb részeit meg kell őrizni. De tudnunk kell, hogy Európa polgárainak bizalmát nem bonyolult szövegekkel, hanem az Unió teljesítményével, munkahelyekkel, gazdasági gyarapodással, Európa közös érdekeinek a világban való hatékony képviseletével lehet visszaszerezni. És hogyha a bizalmat visszaszereztük, akkor az emberek az alkotmányos szerződést is támogatni fogják.",

I have every respect for the people who voted for this text – I myself voted 'yes' – but, at the same time, we cannot act as if nothing had happened, as if the French and Dutch votes made no difference to the situation. Neither can we act as if there was now only one possible solution, only one result, namely the ratification, after a few detours, of the original text rejected by the French and the Dutch.\nThat is why we need to help the rapporteurs, and to that end I have co-signed, with them and with Mrs Berès, a number of amendments calling for reality to be taken into account. I would refer you in particular to three amendments: Amendment 18, Amendment 24 and Amendment 27. I think that, if we adopt them, if Parliament adopts them, it will give itself a wide range of options, it will be open-minded, it will make a real contribution to the debate, and it will not get bogged down in a single solution, idea or way of thinking. When all is said and done, I want to vote in favour of this text, as do the French socialists, but we cannot do so if it is just a one-way street. Therefore, let us continue to move forwards tomorrow by voting in favour of these amendments.\n(Applause)",

The fact that the European political establishment is now trying to explain this away is a democratic scandal. Politicians and senior officials are now openly discussing how the results of these referenda are to be circumvented. They have, of their own accord, the audacity to interpret the results in terms of dissatisfaction with the governments in office in both countries. They are beginning to calculate how many countries were in favour of the draft Constitution, in spite of its being clear that all the countries have to approve the proposal.\nRarely has it been so clear how wide the gulf is between the political elite and the populations on EU issues. Everything indicates that the draft Constitution would have been rejected in Germany, too, if there had been a referendum there. The same applies to the United Kingdom, Austria, Sweden, Denmark and perhaps other countries too. The EU’s power-wielding elite talks shamelessly, however, about difficult setbacks that made their presence felt last year.

I know it is hard to accept rejection, but look at the figures: 55% of French voters; 62% of Dutch voters. You might try to argue that the voters have got it wrong; that they are suffering from what Marxists used to call false consciousness; that they need better propaganda; that it is up to us – the Euro-elite – to point them in the right direction. To which I say, ‘Do your damnedest’.\nCurrent polls in the Netherlands show that 82% of Dutch voters would now vote ‘no’ – a tribute to the level-headedness of that brave people. But if you think you can turn them around, dear colleagues, be my guests. Doing so would at least prove your commitment to the democratic ideals you so frequently invoke.\nFar more outrageous would be to push ahead with the implementation of the Constitution – or, at least, of its contents – without popular consent. Yet this is precisely what you are doing. Look at the number of policies and institutions envisaged by the Constitution that have been or are being enacted regardless: the European External Action Service, the European Human Rights Agency, the European Defence Agency, the European Space Programme, the European External Borders Agency, a justiciable Charter of Fundamental Rights: none of these has any proper legal basis outside the Constitution. By adopting them anyway, you demonstrate that you will allow no force – internal or external, neither your own rule book nor the expressed opposition of your peoples in the ballot box – to arrest the rush to political assimilation. In doing so, you vindicate the severest of your opponents’ criticisms.\nIn the words of my countryman Oliver Cromwell ‘I beseech you in the bowels of Christ, think it possible you may be mistaken’.\n(Applause)",

Wenn Sie, liebe Kollegen, jedoch glauben sollten, Sie könnten sie umstimmen, dann nur zu.

He questions the legitimacy of implementing parts of the EU Constitution without direct popular consent and highlights the ongoing establishment of various EU agencies and policies that lacked specific mandate from the public.",
        "positionSum": "Hannan takes a strong position against proceeding with EU constitutional reforms and related institution-building in the absence of democratic approval. He criticizes the EU leadership's willingness to ignore popular votes and proceed with politically integrative measures, framing this approach as undemocratic.",
        "argSum": "He argues that proceeding with constitutional and institutional reforms without consent undermines democratic ideals and vindicates criticisms made by opponents of EU integration. Hannan also asserts that the lack of a proper legal basis for new EU agencies and policies exemplifies disregard for both the rule of law and public opinion expressed through referendums.",

In addition, it was dealt with in record time. It links in very well with the Austrian Presidency’s priorities presented to us today and also with the Finnish Presidency and the future German Presidency.\nThis means that despite the doubts and reluctance expressed, the Constitution has certainly not been discarded. It is not a thing of the past. On the contrary, it continues to feature prominently on our agendas. As a result of the French and Dutch ‘no’ votes, the Constitution remains very much alive because we are continuing to debate it. All Europeans need to find an answer to the question as to the kind of Europe they want.\nBy way of this resolution, Parliament is calling on all European citizens to engage in a far-reaching discussion of the question to which I just referred. It is also calling on all national parliaments and governments to state what their expectations are. We should be saying to the governments of the nine Member States which have not yet ratified the Constitution that since their Prime Ministers signed the document, they ought to commence ratification proceedings because it is their right and duty to do so under international law. It is a duty pursuant to the Convention on the Law of Treaties.\nI should like to add one final comment. A country’s approach to the European Constitution is not simply a test of its will to help build a common Europe. It is also a test of that country’s credibility as a partner in international relations.",

It is more about the way in which Europe ensures that its institutions act in accordance with a moral awareness of the world. All of us, citizens of Europe, in the corridors of power, on the Union’s front line, feel the weight of this challenge. How can we govern such a huge and open cosmopolitan area? How can we realise a project of justice that lies both inside and outside Europe’s boundaries? How can we build a way of life not based on tradition? How can we turn Europe into a democratic power and founder of a new world order? How, as a union of different communities, can we be a role model? How can we find a way, together, of protecting human rights around the world? How can we find a way, together, of influencing the world? How can we return to politics its legislative power over a globalised and deregulated economy? How can we connect justice with efficiency? How can we open the doors to new political models?\nThe future allows us no room for fear. We have an urgent need to discuss political integration, to discuss the introduction of a cosmopolitan and more human way of life, to discuss the extent to which the Constitution itself represents and constructs our European identity.

Nor shall I refer to the detailed, extensive and exhaustive discussions held last year; I shall refer to the dialogue to which they refer.\nI wish to express the opinion that the dialogue which we need to hold must revolve not around the Constitution but around the existential problems of the European Union, which are: firstly, the degree to which the European Union is still necessary; secondly, if the European Union is necessary, what type of European Union do we want and, thirdly, how enlarged a European Union do we want.\nIf there is no common answer to these existential questions at the level of both policies and citizens, I greatly fear that no form of Constitution for Europe will ever be acceptable to the citizens of Europe. If and insofar as we in the European Union believe that it needs to be unified and strengthened, then our challenge is to convince the citizens also of the correctness of this way forward. Confidence and faith in the European vision are the basis of the universal consent of states and citizens to constitutional arrangements for the functioning of the European Union.\nIf the citizens of the European states do not realise the importance to mankind of the existence and further unification and strengthening of the European Union, then I predict that no constitutional proposal will be accepted in future. That is why I believe that we should not waste any more time. We need to build on what we have and what we have today is the Constitution.

Some, however, attach greater weight to percentages in surveys than to the procedures required by constitutional law.\nNor do I have any sympathy with the modus operandi adopted by those who already want to discuss alternatives, even before the ongoing ratification process is completed. Those who are now calling for new alternatives are treating as worthless the decisions democratically reached in most of the Member States of the European Union.\nMore to the point, where are these alternatives? In the Convention on the Future of Europe, we had long discussions on all of them; discussions about a more democratic Europe, a more social Union and so on. Over and over again, we came up with the same results. Desirable though they might be, every improvement of that kind would end up producing more Europe, and a stronger Europe, and hence the very thing that most of the Member States and the people who live in them do not at present want – a continuing loss of power on the part of the nation states. Let us then do what the majority in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has proposed; let us try to inform the European public about what really is, and is not, in the 2004 Constitutional Treaty, and let us have a second run at getting a consensus in support of the best constitution currently on the market.",

A whole range of them have been expressed, but one thing that has been said does strike me as corresponding to the majority view in the Council, and that is that the European Union, at this present time, before we get a clearer view of the situation, should keep every realistic and reasonable option open, for what we have learned from our experiences over the past year is that quick, perhaps even premature or precipitate estimates of the situation get us nowhere in this debate.

A whole range of them have been expressed, but one thing that has been said does strike me as corresponding to the majority view in the Council, and that is that the European Union, at this present time, before we get a clearer view of the situation, should keep every realistic and reasonable option open, for what we have learned from our experiences over the past year is that quick, perhaps even premature or precipitate estimates of the situation get us nowhere in this debate.

Ten Member States have not yet expressed an opinion and several of their leaders do not think they will do so.

  "summary": "**Executive Summary of Parliamentary Debate on 'The Period of Reflection: Structure, Subjects and Context for an Assessment of the Debate on the EU'**\n\n---\n\n**1. Debate Information**\n\n- **Topic:** The period of reflection: structure, subjects and context for an assessment of the debate on the EU\n- **Date:** (Not specified, but contemporaneous with the aftermath of the French and Dutch referenda on the EU Constitutional Treaty, mid-2000s)\n- **Number of Contributions:** Over 50, with 45+ substantive and attributed contributions analyzed here\n\n---\n\n**2. Executive Summary**\n\n**Context and Background**\n\nThis debate responds to the crisis following the rejection of the proposed EU Constitutional Treaty by referenda in France and the Netherlands. The parliamentary session was convened to assess the way forward for the European Union, focusing on the structure, subjects, and context of the ensuing 'period of reflection.' Key concerns included the loss of public trust, the EU’s democratic legitimacy, the proper relationship between European and national institutions, inclusion of citizens, and the appropriate institutional or constitutional reforms.\n\n**Key Themes and Positions**\n\n**A. Proponents of a Structured Reflection and Renewal—Without Abandoning the Constitution**\n  \nSeveral speakers advocated for a carefully structured period of reflection designed to reconnect the EU with its citizens, assess the fate of the Constitutional Treaty, and weigh possible reforms:\n\n- **Andrew Duff** called for “a series of parliamentary forums to debate some fundamental…questions about the nature and purpose of Europe,” aiming to close the period of reflection with a clear decision on the Treaty by end-2007 ([Duff]). He identified two strategic options: supplementing the existing Treaty text or making substantive changes in response to citizens’ concerns.\n\n- **Johannes Voggenhuber** emphasized turning the debate “back to the citizens” with a structured set of taboo questions (from EU borders to the social model and rights) and suggested a revision process or a pan-European referendum ([Voggenhuber]).\n\n- **Margot Wallström** urged a patient, inclusive dialogue, stating, “it is essential to listen to citizens, social partners, political parties, and national and regional parliaments without prejudging the result” and rejected “piecemeal implementation” of the Constitution ([Wallström]).\n\n- **Hans Winkler**, on behalf of the Council, pressed for “a broad debate on what sort of Europe we want” and emphasized, “there are no quick fixes, no tricks and no shortcuts” ([Winkler]), proposing a series of public events and a collaborative road map.\n\n- **Maria Berger, Carlos Carnero González, Genowefa Grabowska, and Jo Leinen** all supported maintaining the Constitutional Treaty as the most viable framework, while supporting broader engagement and cautioning against dismantling hard-won aspects of the draft.\n\n**B. Need for Inclusive, Citizen-Focused, and Content-Driven Debate**\n\nSpeakers from across the political spectrum stressed:\n  \n- A focus on issues that affect citizens’ lives, not just institutions (e.g., Hannes Swoboda called for policy-driven debates: “if we do not focus on institutional questions but on substantive ones” [Swoboda]), and Paolo Costa warned, “the error to avoid is to turn the pause for reflection into a pause for inaction” ([Costa]).\n  \n- The necessity to explain the tangible benefits of European integration, especially in key policy areas (energy, security, economic growth), and to improve transparency and communication (Irena Belohorská and Elmar Brok: “We need to take citizens' concerns seriously…We should use the reflection phase for this” [Brok]; [Belohorská]).\n\n- Calls for genuine participation mechanisms and pan-European democratic reforms (Jules Maaten: “Why not give citizens real influence…for example, the direct election of the President of the Commission or the possibility of a collective European referendum?” [Maaten]).\n\n**C. Opposition to Imposing the Constitution After Rejection**\n\nA considerable group, mainly from eurosceptic or independent groupings, opposed attempts to repackage or pursue the same Constitutional Treaty after its rejection:\n\n- **Francis Wurtz, Jens-Peter Bonde, James Hugh Allister, Bruno Gollnisch, and Nils Lundgren** strongly condemned what they saw as an elite-driven effort to bypass democratic outcomes: “With breathtaking arrogance, this report…seeks to second-guess and repudiate the democratic verdict of the people of France and Holland” ([Allister]); “the Constitution is dead! Still you urge national parliaments to break the law” ([Bonde]); “The European political establishment is now trying to explain away the referendum results. This is a democratic scandal” ([Lundgren]).\n\n- They called for alternative approaches (reviewing existing treaties, starting with new conventions, synchronised referenda) and warned against democratic disenfranchisement.\n\n**D. Calls for Substantial Alternatives and a New Social Agenda**\n\n- **Monica Frassoni, Sylvia-Yvonne Kaufmann, and others** argued for considering amendments to the constitutional draft, launching new constitutional processes if needed, and prioritizing social Europe: “Europe needs a new treaty…and a policy shift to a more social Europe” ([Kaufmann]).\n\n- **Ignasi Guardans Cambó** criticized the repetitive approach and called for developing “a new dish…a new dish cooked to the taste of all” ([Guardans Cambó]), while **Pierre Moscovici** advocated for flexibility and openness to plural solutions.\n\n**E. The Role of National Parliaments, Gender, and New Member States**\n\n- **Alexander Stubb** and several others emphasized inclusivity, rejecting ‘core Europe’ proposals or Parliament’s “arrogance or paternalism” towards national parliaments ([Stubb]).\n\n- **Edit Bauer** warned against approaches that divide Europe or marginalize women’s voices, stating, “One of the worst outcomes would be a redivision of Europe into core and non-core countries” ([Bauer]).\n\n**F. Calls for Action, Unity, and Avoidance of Paralysis**\n\n- **Stavros Lambrinidis** and **Jan Masiel** stressed the need for action over endless debate and the critical importance of European unity: “Let us get to work at last” ([Lambrinidis]); “Before we again propose a constitution to citizens, let us eliminate our existing divisions, listen to their voice, and this time take it into account” ([Masiel]).\n\n**G. On Institutional Legitimacy, Transparency, and Media**\n\n- **Jean-Marie Cavada** advocated for immediate use of constitutional advancements, especially on fundamental rights ([Cavada]).\n\n- **Reinhard Rack** and **Willem Schuth** argued for respecting formal democratic procedures and strengthening parliamentary involvement—especially in the CAP ([Schuth]).\n\n- **Irena Belohorská** stressed the urgent need for transparency, media engagement, and accessible information ([Belohorská]).\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion and Actionable Outcomes**\n\nThe debate demonstrated no clear consensus about either the fate of the Constitutional Treaty or the shape of the future EU. However, several common actionable threads emerged:\n\n1. **Hold an Authentic, Pan-European Reflection** with broad, inclusive forums, substantive citizen engagement, transparent communication, and robust involvement of national parliaments, social partners, women, and media.\n\n2. **Address Citizens’ Real Concerns** (growth, jobs, security, social cohesion) in parallel with—rather than after or in place of—institutional or constitutional reform efforts.\n\n3. **Avoid Prejudging Outcomes; All Options Remain Open**—including retaining, amending, supplementing, or entirely rewriting the treaty—as repeatedly emphasized ([Duff]; [Winkler]; [Corbett]; [Moscovici]).\n\n4. **Reject Partial Implementation and Piecemeal Solutions** to protect treaty integrity and the legitimacy of the process ([Wallström]; [Méndez de Vigo]).\n\n5. **Restore Trust Through Results** — focus on improvement in EU governance and policies rather than constitutional engineering alone ([Szájer]).\n\n6. **Reaffirm Democratic Legitimacy** by aligning institutional actions with referendum and public opinion outcomes—whether this leads to renewal, revision, or rejection of the Constitutional Treaty.\n\nThese actions, if taken, would aim to refresh the EU’s legitimacy, renew public faith, and produce either a reformed constitutional settlement or alternative arrangements better attuned to contemporary European aspirations.\n\n---",
