Little time now remains before Parliament takes this great step, this great decision, but if I had no more than a minute in which to speak, I would use it to thank my fellow rapporteur, Mr Duff, for the extraordinary honour and pleasure of working with him on this.\nFrom him I learned that the future \u2013 by which I mean the future we share in this Europe of ours \u2013 can be found by looking in the most diverse directions, and for that I am very grateful to him. If the combination of a Green Austrian and an English Liberal is not a handicap from the word go, then I do believe that other combinations can work just as well.\nOf course, not even the harmonious notes sounded by the President of the Council\u2019s magic flute this morning could mask the crisis that is going on in Europe, and, while he did not mention it, I would like to, and I would like to say something about what is at the heart of this crisis. At the centre of this whole, newly-ignited, dispute, the disagreements we have, and the European crisis, is a single sentence uttered by the founding father of the European Union, Jean Monnet, who said, \u2018We are not uniting states; we are uniting people\u2019. That is what today\u2019s argument is about.\nAre we to have a Europe of chancelleries, governments and elites, or the union of citizens to which this constitution has opened the door? Those who talk as if the constitution were dead are rejecting the human Europe, giving the intergovernmental Europe a shot in the arm and conjuring up the ghosts of the 19th\u00a0century, those primal misfortunes from Pandora\u2019s box: nationalism, rivalry between states, the concept of the balance of power, the striving for dominance, a fragmented Europe incapable of maintaining its own peace, let alone of becoming a power for peace. That is what this dispute is about.\nBefore we entered the Chamber, there were fellow Members there to welcome us dressed as ostriches. They had no need to dress up, for we knew perfectly well who they were, and we are not blind; we know that the nationalists regarded the temporary failure of the ratification process as presenting them with an historic opportunity for a nationalist renaissance. To them, by this report, and with virtual unanimity, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs delivers a resounding \u2018no\u2019.\n(Applause)\nThe Constitution is not dead, for people\u2019s need for a future in which they can live in Europe in freedom and peace at home and abroad lives on as an objective in their hearts and minds, and the Constitution is a crucial step in moving towards a social order, a political architecture, a political space, in which such a future is possible.\nThe crisis that the report we are presenting today attempts to resolve is a crisis of confidence, the crisis of a Union that cannot tell the difference between a union of citizens and a union of states, a Union in which people\u2019s expectations are disappointed as a veritable matter of course. It has no answer to social issues, it suffers from a democracy deficit, fundamental rights are not secured, there is not enough transparency, and the power of governments is unbridled and subject to few controls. This constitution, though, is a step forward, and if it is beset by difficulties, then we will try to keep it on course.\nWhat we have conceived is a European debate; I see us as bringing the process back to the people, and that adds up to nothing less than taking the elites\u2019 project and turning it into a res publica , a popular cause.\nI hope that this House \u2013 if it adopts this report \u2013 will join us in appealing to all the parties, to the population at large, to the municipalities and regions, to the trade unions and to civil society, to carry on with this debate, to take up the future of this Europe of ours as a popular cause and to join with us in contending for it.\nWe did not envisage that this debate should be without form. We, in all the groups, agreed on six questions, covering many issues that people fight shy of talking about: the goal of European integration, the borders of Europe, the future of the economic and social model, Europe\u2019s role in the world, the area of security, freedom and law, not to mention the social issues \u2013 and, even if the constitution does not do all the things we want it to do, which it goes without saying it will not, then I do nonetheless hope that this plan brings us a good deal closer to this objective.\nPerhaps I might say one more thing about precisely where our difference with the Constitutional Affairs Committee lies. What the rapporteurs want, and what they have fought for, is another step forward rather than the continued ratification process being regarded as the end product of this debate; they want it also to be possible to improve the constitution, to retain what is at its heart and, in 2007, to revise it in a more open process and a more credible debate, with the revision to be presented to the public in a Europe-wide referendum. My hope is that, aided by the Commission\u2019s level-headedness and this House\u2019s courage, this further step may be taken.\n(Applause)", "lang": "DE", "original": "Johannes Voggenhuber (Verts/ALE), Berichterstatter . \u2013 Herr Pr\u00e4sident, Frau Kommissarin, Herr Ratspr\u00e4sident, liebe Kolleginnen und Kollegen!

Er hat nicht davon gesprochen. Ich m\u00f6chte davon sprechen, und ich m\u00f6chte vom Kern dieser Krise sprechen. All dieser neu ausgebrochene Streit, die Zerw\u00fcrfnisse, die europ\u00e4ische Krise drehen sich um einen einzigen Satz, ausgesprochen von DEM Gr\u00fcndervater der Europ\u00e4ischen Union, Jean Monnet: \u201eWir vereinigen Menschen, nicht Staaten\u201c. Der Streit, der heute gef\u00fchrt wird, geht darum.\nGibt es ein Europa der Staatskanzleien, der Regierungen, der B\u00fcrokratien, der Eliten, oder gibt es die Union der B\u00fcrger, zu der diese Verfassung den Weg ge\u00f6ffnet hat? Wer heute vom Tod der Verfassung spricht, erteilt dem Europa der Menschen eine Absage, st\u00e4rkt das Europa der Regierungen und beschw\u00f6rt die Gespenster des 19.\u00a0Jahrhunderts herauf, jene Urkrankheiten aus der B\u00fcchse der Pandora, den Nationalismus, die Rivalit\u00e4t der Staaten, das Balancedenken, das Hegemoniestreben, das Europa der Zersplitterung, das seinen eigenen Frieden nicht wahren, geschweige denn zu einer Friedensmacht werden kann. Darum wird dieser Streit gef\u00fchrt.\nDa drau\u00dfen vor dem Saal haben uns Abgeordnetenkollegen als Vogel Strau\u00df verkleidet empfangen. Sie h\u00e4tten sich nicht verkleiden m\u00fcssen, wir haben sie auch so gut erkannt, und wir sind nicht blind; wir wissen, dass das vorl\u00e4ufige Scheitern des Ratifikationsprozesses in den Augen der Nationalisten eine historische Chance f\u00fcr die Renaissance des Nationalismus ist. Dem erteilt dieses Haus in gro\u00dfer \u00dcbereinstimmung aller im Ausschuss f\u00fcr konstitutionelle Fragen vertretenen Fraktionen mit diesem Bericht eine Absage.\n(Beifall)\nDie Verfassung ist nicht tot, weil das Bed\u00fcrfnis der Menschen, in der Zukunft frei und gleich in innerem und \u00e4u\u00dferem Frieden in Europa zusammenzuleben, als Ziel in den K\u00f6pfen und Herzen der Menschen Bestand hat. Und auf dem Weg, eine Ordnung zu finden, eine politische Architektur, einen politischen Raum zu entwerfen, in dem das m\u00f6glich ist, ist die Verfassung ein entscheidender Schritt.\nWir legen heute einen Bericht vor, in dem versucht wird, eine Strategie zur Beilegung dieser Krise zu entwerfen. Es ist eine Vertrauenskrise, es ist die Krise einer Union, die zwischen der Union der B\u00fcrger und der Union der Staaten nicht unterscheiden kann, in der die Erwartungen der Menschen geradezu programmatisch entt\u00e4uscht werden. Die Antwort auf die soziale Frage fehlt, die Demokratie ist defizit\u00e4r, die Grundrechte sind nicht verankert, die Transparenz ist ungen\u00fcgend, die Macht der Regierungen wenig kontrolliert und nicht gez\u00e4hmt. Aber diese Verfassung ist ein Schritt, und wenn sie in Schwierigkeiten ist, so versuchen wir, auf diesem Weg fortzufahren.\nWir haben eine europ\u00e4ische Debatte entworfen; ich denke, wir bringen den Prozess zur\u00fcck zu den B\u00fcrgern, und das hei\u00dft nicht weniger, als aus einem Projekt der Eliten eine res publica zu machen, eine Sache der Menschen selbst.\nIch hoffe, das Haus appelliert - wenn es diesen Bericht annimmt - mit uns auch an alle Parteien, an die Bev\u00f6lkerung, an die Kommunen und Regionen, an die Gewerkschaften, an die zivile Gesellschaft, diese Debatte zu f\u00fchren und diese Zukunft Europas als res publica mit aufzunehmen und mit uns darum zu streiten.\nWir haben diese Debatte nicht unstrukturiert vorgeschlagen. Wir haben uns, quer durch die Fraktionen, auf sechs Fragen geeinigt, darunter viele tabuisierte Fragen: das Ziel der europ\u00e4ischen Integration, die Grenzen Europas, die Zukunft des \u00f6konomischen und sozialen Modells, die Rolle Europas in der Welt, die Frage des Raums von Sicherheit, Freiheit und Recht, auch die soziale Frage. Und auch wenn die Verfassung nicht alle W\u00fcnsche erf\u00fcllt - selbstverst\u00e4ndlich tut sie das nicht -, so hoffe ich, dass wir mit diesem Plan diesem Ziel einen gro\u00dfen Schritt n\u00e4her kommen.\nErlauben Sie mir nur noch ein Wort dazu, wo die Differenz zum Ausschuss f\u00fcr konstitutionelle Fragen liegt. Die Berichterstatter sind gewillt und haben darum gek\u00e4mpft, einen Schritt weiterzugehen und nicht nur die Fortsetzung des Ratifikationsprozesses als Ergebnis dieser Debatte zu sehen, sondern auch die M\u00f6glichkeit, die Verfassung zu verbessern, ihren Kern zu erhalten und 2007 einen Revisionsprozess zu beschlie\u00dfen, offener darzulegen, um die Debatte glaubw\u00fcrdiger zu machen, und eine solche Revision auch in einer europ\u00e4ischen Volksbefragung den B\u00fcrgern vorzulegen.

(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great joy to me to be speaking today in your plenary and meeting you, both of these things for the first time. I am particularly glad that the mandatory dialogue between the institutions has reached a topic that is particularly demanding of cooperation. As both the rapporteurs have already said, it is true to say that 2005 was a difficult year; Mr Voggenhuber went so far as to use the word \u2018crisis\u2019. We are indeed going through a crisis of confidence where the European public are concerned. We must answer those questions that they have every right to ask of us. I also agree with Mr Duff that this crisis of confidence and these misgivings about the European project present all of us with an opportunity, of which all of us together \u2013 the Commission, Parliament and the Council \u2013 must make use.\nIt is at this point that I would like to extend most especial thanks to your House, for you were wrestling with this issue at a time when the governments were not yet willing to make a serious start on debate. The Duff/Voggenhuber report has been the occasion, in this House, for a debate that will help us to move on. The Austrian Presidency has, from its very first day, endeavoured to engage in this debate, to carry it further and develop it. You will all have been able, as you followed it, to note how very vigorous it has been from the very outset, with the whole spectrum of opinions being given voice, and the report adopted by the Constitutional Affairs Committee reflects that.\nOne thing that does come across clearly is that there are no quick fixes, no tricks and no shortcuts, whereby we might, so to speak, throw a bridge across the confidence gap between Europe and its citizens. Only a real and serious engagement with the problems will be credible and effective in the long term. Our belief that this debate must be a wide-ranging one reflects the view expressed in your report, which we are debating today. What we need is not just a debate about the constitutional treaty or the legal dimension, but a broad debate on what sort of Europe we want, where we want to go, where Europe\u2019s borders are, and how we can address the European public\u2019s fears and worries.\nWe, in the Council, want not only to continue with this debate, but also to conduct it in greater depth. We have planned a series of events at which we want to have broad-based discussions with the European public. Only yesterday, we were discussing with the Commission and with your House the methods and strategies whereby we might communicate this Europe of ours and what it stands for to the public and by what means, in what discussion forums and in what depth we might best meet the expectations that people have of Europe.\nAs the President of the Council said today, we do intend, at the same time as we kick off the debate, to consider the issue of European identity. On the 250th anniversary of Mozart\u2019s birth, in Salzburg, we intend to address the question of \u2018What is Europe, what is the European identity?\u2019\nRight through to the end of the Austrian Presidency, there will be a whole series of other events, for the debate on Europe\u2019s future is a many-sided one, and it is only when all of its sides are lit that all the dimensions with which we have to do become apparent. Important though this public debate is, there will also have to be practical work done in order that it may be clearer to us which way we should go, and it will have to be done by the governments of the Member States.\nThe Council Presidency\u2019s most important task is to get all the Member States on board, for it is only together that we will be able to move forward. As the Chancellor has already said, what we want to achieve is to be able, at the end of our Presidency, to produce a sketch of the way ahead and to agree on how we can best cooperate in achieving our common goals.\nI hope that one consequence of our joint effort over the coming months will be an increase in positive thinking in Europe, and I agree with Mr Voggenhuber that we must discuss Europe as a res publica , as something that really is to the benefit of all its citizens.\n(Applause)", "lang": "EN", "original": "Hans Winkler, President-in-Office of the Council .

Mr President, honourable Members, in this first plenary part-session of the year I should like to wish all of you an excellent 2006. From the Constitutional point of view, I believe it can only be better than last year. I hope, as the person responsible both for Constitutional issues and for interinstitutional affairs, that we can continue our fruitful, effective and close cooperation.\nI wish to thank the rapporteurs for this report on the period of reflection and the motion for a resolution. I have already discussed it on several occasions with the two Members of the European Parliament who were members of the European Convention. I would like to underline the considerable progress made since the initial considerations and congratulate the co-rapporteurs for the job they have done and also for their ability to take on board the many views expressed during the intense discussions in committee.\nI will limit my remarks to four points. The first is that we all wish to achieve a constitutional settlement, to make Europe more transparent, more democratic and more effective. The question is how to achieve that settlement after the French and Dutch \u2018no\u2019 votes. I was happy to see that all options regarding the Constitution remain open in your resolution. During the reflection period it is essential to listen to citizens, social partners, political parties, and national and regional parliaments without prejudging the result of the wider dialogue and debate. If we do not, this exercise will lose all its value.\nI also took note of your favourite option. Maintaining the Constitution, however, will not be possible without French and Dutch support with, if necessary, additional clarifications and measures. Recent Eurobarometer surveys have shown that European citizens\u2019 support for the concept of a Constitution for the EU has increased by two percentage points over the past five months to 63%. Therefore, as has been said many times in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, it is important to change the context rather than the text. That is why the dialogue has to focus on the European project in connection with Constitutional reform, and on the ultimate objective linked to the instruments to deliver it. It is only after the listening exercise based on the results of national debates is complete, that we will be able to draw conclusions on the best Constitutional settlement for Europe. That is also why the Commission wants to focus on policy priorities addressing citizens\u2019 concerns on growth, jobs, employment and security.\nSecondly, I fully share your resistance to proposals for core groups of certain Member States. What we want is a Europe for everyone, not just for some. The Union is in the process of consolidating the most recent accession process. We still have to work hard to ensure the smooth integration of the new Member States. My view is that any enhanced cooperation must, in all circumstances, be undertaken within the existing Treaties and remain open to all Member States.\nYou can rest assured that the Commission and myself will not support any proposal for enhanced cooperation outside the European Union institutional framework.\n(Applause)\nThirdly, it seems reasonable to me to draft final conclusions on the reflection period in 2007, under the German or Portuguese Presidency. The June 2006 European Council is clearly a major milestone in this process, but it should not be the end of it. It will, of course, be up to the European Council to decide on any potential extension of the reflection period beyond the June 2006 extension already suggested by the Austrian Presidency. In any case, as announced in Plan D, the Commission will prepare a communication for the June European Council setting out its thinking on the initial feedback received during the period of reflection, and this will be based on the national visits currently being undertaken by the President, myself and fellow Commissioners, a special Eurobarometer report, discussion forums and the 9 May conferences.\nThis synthesis report should explain the background and approach taken by the Commission over the last year, outline the initial results of the listening exercise and provide a series of conclusions for the Austrian Presidency on the next steps to be taken. This will complement the factual report that will be prepared by the Austrian Presidency on the basis of contributions from the Member States.\nFourthly, I support your rejection of piecemeal implementation of the Constitution. The reason for that is simple - it has to do with respect. Respect for those who said \u2018no\u2019 and for those who have already ratified, and respect for the institutional balance. Cherry-picking could give the impression that the Union is trying to circumvent the results of national referenda and is liable to impair the overall institutional balance.\nWe should respect the difference between our institutions and those in the Member States and, most of all, when we embark on various praiseworthy initiatives and projects we should always respect each country\u2019s democratic traditions. All of us play important, but different, roles.\nIn conclusion, I would stress that we cannot discuss these issues without entering into political debate and discussing political priorities. European citizens will see that there are political differences in Europe. This is another forum for discussing political priorities, but without it and without any discussion on constitutional matters nothing will work. We have to combine this process with creating legitimacy for our institutions by delivering the political results that European citizens want, so we have to consider their daily concerns as well as the constitutional issues.\n(Applause)", "lang": "EN", "original": "Margot Wallstr\u00f6m, Vice-President of the Commission .

This failure, which had to do not only with national issues but also with the mood in Europe as a whole, represents a failure on the part of national politics, but also of European politics, in that we have not succeeded in justifying Europe.\nWe have to take the public\u2019s concerns seriously, not least in France and in the Netherlands; we cannot simply disregard them, but should spell out why we need this sort of Europe. That is what the period of reflection needs to be used for; it is not a period for debate on details in the constitution, but a time when Europe must be justified to people.\nIt has to be clear to us, and we have to make it clear to others, that the constitutional treaty contains things the absence of which the public formerly criticised, such as greater capacity to act in foreign and security policy matters, on which the opinion I have drafted concentrates, and which, according to all opinion surveys, is precisely what the public want. They want Europe to be represented to the outside world, and it is precisely so that it may be that there are rules in the constitution, rules that only it provides for and which we, under present conditions, cannot lay down without it. It creates a new form of subsidiarity involving the national parliaments, thereby making centralisation impossible, and backs up this concept of subsidiarity with solidarity.\nCitizens\u2019 rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights have a major part to play in this. This constitution makes the citizens into decision-making actors and also provides them with protection. It must also be clear to us that in future, for example, the President of the Commission, as head of the European executive, will emerge directly from the elections to the European Parliament, with the public having a part to play in that. That is why we should focus on the fact that Parts I and\u00a0II are the actual constitutional treaty itself, whilst Part III is the Treaty of Nice, about which there have been misunderstandings that we have not been able to eradicate, and so I am grateful to the Austrian Presidency for its willingness to put forward a \u2018road map\u2019 and glad that Germany, during its presidency, intends to take new initiatives.

Dieses Scheitern, das ja auch mit nationalen Fragen, aber auch mit der Stimmung in Europa insgesamt zu tun hat, ist ein Scheitern nationaler Politik, aber auch europ\u00e4ischer Politik, weil es uns nicht gelungen ist, Europa zu begr\u00fcnden.\nWir m\u00fcssen die Sorgen der B\u00fcrger ernst nehmen; wir m\u00fcssen sie auch in Frankreich und in den Niederlanden ernst nehmen und k\u00f6nnen nicht einfach dar\u00fcber hinweggehen, aber wir sollten deutlich machen, warum wir dieses Europa brauchen. Daf\u00fcr muss die Reflexionsphase genutzt werden. Dies ist kein Zeitraum der Debatte \u00fcber Einzelheiten der Verfassung, sondern Europa muss in den Begr\u00fcndungen zu den Menschen zur\u00fcckgebracht werden.\nDabei m\u00fcssen wir auch sehen und deutlich machen, dass der Verfassungsvertrag gerade Dinge beinhaltet, die der B\u00fcrger kritisiert, weil sie bisher fehlen, z.\u00a0B. eine gr\u00f6\u00dfere Handlungsf\u00e4higkeit im Bereich der Au\u00dfen- und Sicherheitspolitik, worauf sich meine Stellungnahme konzentriert. Alle Meinungsumfragen sagen, dass die B\u00fcrger genau das wollen: die Vertretung Europas nach au\u00dfen hin. Und daf\u00fcr bietet die Verfassung Regelungen, die nur sie vorsieht und die wir unter den gegenw\u00e4rtigen Bedingungen nicht nebenher schaffen k\u00f6nnen. Sie schafft einen neuen Weg der Subsidiarit\u00e4t unter Mitwirkung der nationalen Parlamente, um auf diese Art und Weise Zentralismus zu verhindern, und verbindet diesen Gedanken der Subsidiarit\u00e4t mit der Solidarit\u00e4t.\nDie B\u00fcrgerrechte und die Charta der Grundrechte spielen eine gro\u00dfe Rolle. Die B\u00fcrger werden durch diese Verfassung zu entscheidenden Akteuren, und sie bekommen auch den Schutz. Man muss auch sehen, dass in Zukunft beispielsweise der Kommissionspr\u00e4sident als Spitze der europ\u00e4ischen Exekutive unmittelbar als Resultat aus den Wahlen zum Europ\u00e4ischen Parlament hervorgeht und die B\u00fcrger dabei eine Rolle spielen. Deshalb sollten wir uns auch darauf konzentrieren, dass die Teile\u00a0I und\u00a0II der eigentliche Verfassungsvertrag sind, w\u00e4hrend Teil\u00a0III der Vertrag von Nizza ist. Dieses Missverst\u00e4ndnis haben wir bisher nicht ausr\u00e4umen k\u00f6nnen. Daher bin ich dankbar, dass die \u00f6sterreichische Pr\u00e4sidentschaft eine road map vorlegen wird und Deutschland in seiner Pr\u00e4sidentschaft neue Initiativen ergreifen will. Wir sollten uns jetzt auf den Dialog konzentrieren, die Reflexionsphase bewerten und 2007 die Vorschl\u00e4ge vorlegen. Dies bedeutet, dass wir nicht jetzt schon Ma\u00dfnahmen ergreifen sollten, wie Duff und Voggenhuber es in ihrem Antrag vorschlagen.

I know that the issues that Mr Brok has just raised have prompted a great deal of debate, not least within the political groupings in this House, and there is much to be said for both positions. Perhaps we have to begin with the issues of substance, which we may well have neglected to some degree; how, for example, can we persuade the public that Europe needs a constitution of the kind that has been drafted? I gave a number of examples in the opinion I drafted on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, and perhaps I can adduce one that did not yet count for much at the time I was writing, but has acquired significance over the past few days in this House. I refer, of course, to the issue of energy.\nIt was pretty surprising, indeed pretty astonishing, to see how many Members of this House who had, until recently, perhaps taken a rather sceptical view of such things, are now forthright advocates of a common energy policy; I was delighted to hear what Mr Saryusz-Wolski had to say on the subject. The Federal Chancellor is a constant advocate of subsidiarity; today, as President of the Council, he argued strongly in favour of a common energy policy. This is just one example showing how important it is that the powers and prerogatives that we, particularly in the Constitution, have accorded to the European level be used to the utmost. I see this as the road down which we must go.\nI could, at this point, for example, talk about space policy, which has been another topic for debate in this place, and which is not about sending Europeans into space, but rather about monitoring the environment or giving warnings of tsunamis in good time. There are plenty of other things that are realistic and feasible and capable of being explained to the public if we focus on matters of substance rather than the institutional issues.\nWhat we in this House expect, of course, is a road map or sketch of how things are to progress. I beg you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in all the weighty matters with which you will have to deal over the coming weeks and months of this Presidency, to highlight how much better we could handle them if we had a European constitution.

With the referendum on the Constitution in France and the Netherlands, the citizens who wanted to get in and watch from the terraces went beyond that and organised an actual invasion of the pitch. Today\u2019s crisis in Europe also lies in the fact that it is no longer possible to go back behind closed doors, back to the Europe of the Treaties and elitist decisions, and that, at the same time, no one knows how to get the people back onto the terraces so that they can express their opinions properly as fans normally do.\nReinventing a system of participation and accountability, whereby the Union answers directly to the citizens, without the self-seeking, distorting and misleading mediation of the Member States, is a prerequisite for setting the European project in motion again, whatever its new content may be. The question is, however, accountability for what? We must avoid the mistake of turning the pause for reflection into a pause of inaction.\nNo Plan D will be a success if, in addition to the \u2018D\u2019 for \u2018debate\u2019, \u2018dialogue\u2019 and \u2018democracy\u2019, it does not also include \u2018D\u2019 for \u2018delivery\u2019. Delivery is the best context in which to recast the text of the Constitution, and the best way to make people understand just how useful Europe can be. That is why even self-inflicted failures, like today\u2019s de facto refusal to regulate market access to port services, can become symbolically dangerous.\nThere are areas of recognised European competence in which the existing treaties already provide for qualified majority voting and the interinstitutional codecision procedure \u2013 transport is one example. There are also areas where subsidiarity should properly be interpreted in reverse: not letting the Member States do badly what can be done better at a European level. In these areas of competence, the Union must raise its delivery rate and dare to show how useful it can be.\nToday it is no longer enough to see the Union merely as a clever solution to the problems of war, including the Cold War. What we need is a Union that is equal to the global challenges of the third millennium.

It may therefore have come as a surprise that I was appointed to draft the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development in respect of the report on the period of reflection following the rejection of the Constitution. I consider this a sign of the openness with which our Committee approached this issue. The principle of audiatur et altera pars \u2013 let the other side be heard \u2013 is one of the fundamental preconditions for real dialogue.\nMy views provoked constructive debate in committee, resulting in a compromise that was well thought through, and anything but toothless. The report was endorsed by every member of the Committee, with no votes against, and four abstentions. This demonstrates that dialogue on the future of the Union is possible. Our report in fact advocates principles that are missing from the report of Mr Duff and Mr Voggenhuber. I refer in particular to the principle of legal precaution, by which we should be guided, so that we do not, in the regulations which we approve during the period of reflection, constantly refer to a Constitution that is currently dead from a legal standpoint but which might be resurrected in its original form. It is na\u00efve and misguided to believe that the more often we refer to the Constitution the more we will boost its chances for resuscitation. Such rules may needlessly be undermined at some future point.\nOur Committee\u2019s report also recommends that we enter into cooperation with the institutions of national and regional parliaments, which possess a high degree of qualification and legitimacy, and that we do this more than just once a year for the sake of appearances, as recommended in the report before us today. Unfortunately, there are other parts of the report that strike a discordant note, the most surprising of which is that it sets out what the result of open dialogue ought to be. It evens states that the now dead Constitution is to be ratified in 2009. This is tantamount to trampling over the democratic will of the people of at least two EU Member States.

This House has had a long fight where codecision in agricultural matters is concerned, and the draft constitution\u2019s incorporation of codecision \u2013 which goes back to the Treaties of Amsterdam \u2013 in the fields of environmental protection, food safety and the protection of consumers is something to be welcomed. Where agricultural policy is concerned, however, the Council of Agriculture Ministers can still disregard the opinions of the European Parliament, since the codecision procedure is not, under the current Treaty, applicable to the common agricultural policy.\nAlthough the draft constitution, when considered in the light of the above, held out the prospect of increased democratic legitimacy, in that all decisions on agricultural policy were to be subject to codecision, the Agriculture Committee does believe that the existing text is still in need of some improvements. The objectives of the common agricultural policy, as set out in Article III-227, contradict the goals of the European Union described in Article I-3, and no longer serve any readily explainable purpose. They must, as a matter of urgency, be updated to take account of the multifunctional nature of our present agriculture, which provides work for 10 million people in the EU, is the sole guarantor of the sustainable development of rural areas and cannot be considered in isolation from them.\nThis draft constitution is not equal to the task of creating a CAP that is acceptable to society at large, and so one priority for any future treaty must be to extend codecision to the common agricultural policy, and, in particular, to close the loopholes that remain in Articles III-230 (2) and III-231 (2) of the text as it stands at present.\nSince the CAP is so very important and occupies a predominant position in the EU\u2019s Budget, the European public have every right to the highest possible degree of transparency and, above all in this sensitive area, codecision \u2013 which, as I see it, can mean nothing other than full codecision for the European Parliament on all matters relating to agricultural policy, consumer protection and the safety of food.", "lang": "DE", "original": "Willem Schuth (ALDE), Verfasser der Stellungnahme des mitberatenden Ausschusses f\u00fcr Landwirtschaft und l\u00e4ndliche Entwicklung . \u2013 Herr Pr\u00e4sident, liebe Kolleginnen und Kollegen!

Im Bereich der Agrarpolitik kann sich der Rat der Agrarminister bis heute \u00fcber die Meinung des Europ\u00e4ischen Parlaments hinwegsetzen, da das Mitentscheidungsverfahren nach dem heutigen Vertrag nicht auf die gemeinsame Agrarpolitik Anwendung findet.\nVor diesem Hintergrund stellte der Verfassungsentwurf zwar insofern einen Zugewinn an demokratischer Legitimation in Aussicht, als alle agrarpolitischen Grundsatzentscheidungen der Mitbestimmung unterliegen sollten. Aus Sicht des Landwirtschaftsausschusses bedarf es allerdings noch einiger Verbesserungen am vorliegenden Text. Die in Artikel III-227 genannten Ziele der gemeinsamen Agrarpolitik stehen im Widerspruch zu den in Artikel I-3 formulierten Zielen der Europ\u00e4ischen Union und sind nicht mehr vermittelbar. Sie m\u00fcssen dringend dahingehend aktualisiert werden, dass sie der Multifunktionalit\u00e4t unserer heutigen Landwirtschaft auch tats\u00e4chlich Rechnung tragen.

I hope that that state of affairs is now a thing of the past.\nI have had the honour of drafting the Legal Affairs Committee\u2019s opinion, which is very much in line with the content of this draft report from the lead Committee. The Legal Affairs Committee\u2019s particular concern has been that we should not prematurely abandon the present draft constitution. In the subject areas that really matter to us, such as the composition and powers of the European Court of Justice, the reordering of the lawmaking process and comitology procedure, and judicial cooperation, we simply do not see that a completely new start would enable us to make any real improvements; indeed, it is more likely to have the opposite effect. While I do regret having had to listen today to the Austrian Presidency\u2019s critical views of the powers of the European Court of Justice and the fact that such criticism comes now not only from that source, it does lead me to think that the solutions provided in this draft constitution really are very good after all.\nWe have good legal reasons for objecting to any hasty division of the draft Constitution. Part I contains a very large number of fundamental principles, and we all know that it was only the derogations contained in Part III that made them politically acceptable. We also, albeit with some regret, have good legal reasons for regarding Parts I and III as connected, and no new structure will be possible without fundamental reworking of Part III.\nI will conclude by expressing my grave disappointment with the letter from the three presidents of national parliaments. The sight of many former members of the Convention in this Chamber reminds me of the dedication with which members of the national parliaments worked with us on the draft constitution, of the important proposals they had to make, and, in view of that, I simply cannot regard this letter from the three presidents as being the last word on the subject.", "lang": "DE", "original": "Maria Berger (PSE), Verfasserin der Stellungnahme des mitberatenden Rechtsausschusses . \u2013 Herr Pr\u00e4sident!

What does this opinion say? First of all, it points out all the improvements provided for by the Constitution in relation to the current Treaties. The improvements in terms of security, liberty and justice were many and significant and, above all, they were the subject of consensus on the part of the nations comprising Europe.\nI am not going to list them all, but I shall simply mention four points that are likely to get us over this bad patch and that the excellent report by my colleagues, Mr\u00a0Duff and Mr\u00a0Voggenhuber has put back on the agenda.\nFirstly, the widespread introduction of qualified majority voting and the simplification of the legislative acts enable us to devise a policy rather than be thwarted by the finer points of such a policy. Next, the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, which is a factory of Community law when Parliament is at a loss, is extended. The definitive strengthening of Parliament\u2019s role as co-legislator might also be mentioned, this being something that we need to promote. Finally, integrating the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the very wording of the Constitution confers legal value upon the latter. There are, of course, other positive points, but those I have just listed are genuinely fundamental.\nForgive my alluding to these possibilities still open to us, but I wanted to emphasise the advances entailed by this Constitution in an area not discussed throughout the EU Member States, namely that of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the area of freedom, justice and security. Therein lies, indeed, the material for constructing a framework right now, pending the advent of a new document. Why, therefore, do the Member States not take more advantage of this material in order to try to bind together again an EU that is being given a rough ride?\nFinally, we consider it a matter of priority systematically to take account of the impact of EU policies on fundamental rights and, so that we might not delay in presenting an initial bill, we emphasise how urgent it is to set up an independent Agency for Fundamental Rights, as requested by Parliament on 26\u00a0May 2005.", "lang": "FR", "original": "Jean-Marie Cavada (ALDE), rapporteur pour avis de la commission des libert\u00e9s civiles, de la justice et des affaires int\u00e9rieures . - Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, Monsieur Winkler, Madame Wallstr\u00f6m, la commission des libert\u00e9s civiles a adopt\u00e9 \u00e0 une large majorit\u00e9, le 28\u00a0novembre dernier, l'avis que je lui avais pr\u00e9par\u00e9.

Seldom do we discuss more important issues than the one we are discussing now. Our thanks should go to the rapporteurs who have taken the initiative and, on the basis of broad-ranging discussions, have presented this topic.\nThe future of Europe is our common problem, equally important for the young and the elderly, for men and women. As Mrs\u00a0Wallstr\u00f6m has emphasised, most European citizens see no problem in the decision-making mechanisms of the European institutions. Their problem is primarily a lack of clarity in the vision they have of their own future, their prospects, their security and the new challenges which they are still struggling to find a response to.\nUncertainty and fear of the future were clearly the main factors behind the NO outcome in the votes on the Constitution. Clearly, we are all responsible for finding a way forwards. Those of us here at the European Parliament should be aware of the messages and signals we are sending out when we take decisions, for instance, on cohesion instruments or the transfer of pension rights or when we give preferential treatment to migrants from third countries rather than to the citizens of new Member States.\nThe governments of Member States must bear their share of responsibility for frequently behaving as if European matters, such as the work-life balance goals formulated in the Lisbon Strategy, do not concern them. A fundamental question remains as to whether we will be able to develop a sufficiently appealing common vision and as to whether our European values will be strong enough to produce an adequate level of social cohesion.\nMr President, women account for more than [half] of all European citizens and voters. They have their own specific problems, which call for a sensitive approach and satisfactory solutions. The views of women should therefore be accorded sufficiently serious consideration in the forthcoming debate. Mr President, I would like to emphasise in conclusion that, in the opinion of the Committee for Women\u2019s Rights and Gender Equality, a repeat of the split between the core countries of Europe and the remaining ones would be one of the worst possible outcomes of our efforts to find a way forwards.", "lang": "SK", "original": "Edit Bauer (PPE-DE), Spravodajky\u0148a V\u00fdboru pre pr\u00e1va \u017eien a rovnos\u0165 pohlav\u00ed po\u017eiadan\u00e9ho o stanovisko . \u2013 V\u00e1\u017een\u00fd p\u00e1n predseda, p\u00e1n Winkler, pani komis\u00e1rka, zriedkakedy hovor\u00edme o d\u00f4le\u017eitej\u0161\u00edch ot\u00e1zkach, ako pr\u00e1ve teraz.

We have not changed our opinion, and we do not think that the Constitution should be declared defunct before we have examined it for signs of life. Otherwise, it will be impossible to declare that the patient is dead.\nNor, however, can the fact be ignored that, during the process of ratification, a disjunction appeared between the desire for deeper integration, demonstrated by the European elites, and the feelings of a section of European society. This disjunction is not only of relevance to the two countries that refused to ratify the draft Constitution. It is a serious problem.\nJean Monnet used to say that, faced with a serious problem, its context sometimes has to be changed. That is precisely the purpose of the period of reflection. The great public debate on the future of the European Union should create a new context for the European constitutional enterprise. It is for the European Parliament to define the framework and the arrangements for these debates, to have the national parliaments and civil society take part in them, to specify the questions and to draw up the necessary agenda. It is in that way that it will be possible for the European forum to appear, and to do so in the form of a public space for Europe. We must not decide just yet on the future of the document.

The European Union needs a democratic Constitution and cannot just stumble along with Nice. The debate that must take place on the Constitution has to be a European debate, and the letter sent by the three presidents of national parliaments shows that responsibility for the debate cannot be left at national level, but that there is a need for a truly European body, like this Parliament, to conduct it and \u2013 all right, yes, we must say it openly \u2013 to steer it as well.\nTwo things are missing in the report, however, and we hope to be able to introduce them with the vote in this House. In fact, Mr\u00a0Corbett, I do not agree with you: it is absolutely not true that the movement of those who voted \u2018yes\u2019 to the Constitution is split between those who now want to get rid of the text and those who want to keep it. It is not like that. The amendment that we shall put to the vote tomorrow explicitly states that one possibility \u2013 not a theoretical one, but a practical one \u2013 might be to change the text and that, if that were to happen, it would require a new constitutional process, which might also end with a referendum.\nTo think, however, that the only proposal that we, as the European Parliament, should put forward is to maintain the current text and nothing else is false and short-sighted, and it is that attitude that might really divide the pro-European movement, that is to say the movement that obtained broad support for the Constitution in this House, with 500 votes.\nI therefore believe that the two amendments tabled by the rapporteurs should be supported by a large majority in this Parliament, because they simply state that it is possible to debate various options. Perhaps no option is better than the others, but I believe that they should all be discussed, including the one that right now sounds strangely drastic, which is that we should reopen the debate on the Constitution with the citizens as well.\n(Applause)", "lang": "IT", "original": "Monica Frassoni, a nome del gruppo Verts/ALE . \u2013 Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, il gruppo dei Verdi/Alleanza libera europea sostiene la relazione Duff-Voggenhuber.

My group is prepared to take an active part in the debate on the future of the Union with our fellow citizens. As regards the topics put forward for those discussions, we agree with them in essence.\nThe question that arises is this: what will be the political result of this debate? How far are you prepared to go in transforming the policies and structures of the EU as it is, in order to meet the demands being made by most of Europe's societies, which were demonstrated most spectacularly by the rejection of the constitutional treaty?

The report now before us proposes only, and I quote, 'to reassure \u2026 public opinion', given that, and again I quote, 'in any case \u2026 the Constitution enters into force during 2009'.

It was good news for my country and surely for the whole of the Union. I say this because we Spanish joined twenty years ago and a little more than a year ago we held a referendum and voted \u2018yes\u2019 to the European Constitution, with the same rights, duties and responsibilities with which other countries, France and the Netherlands, voted \u2018no\u2019. A \u2018yes\u2019 is worth the same as a \u2018no\u2019, whether expressed by referendum or by a parliament. And today an absolute majority of members of the Union have said yes to the European Constitution.\nThis report \u2013 I have had the opportunity to work with its two rapporteurs for four months, as shadow rapporteur for the Socialist Group \u2013 is a balanced result, which essentially says four things:\nFirstly, this Parliament still considers the Constitution to be the best instrument for creating a more democratic and effective Union.\nSecondly, if it does not enter into force, the Union\u2019s political and institutional problems will worsen, not just persist, and furthermore it will be impossible to carry out more enlargements on the basis of the Treaty of Nice following the entry of Bulgaria and Rumania.\nThirdly, we must begin a genuine period of reflection and debate, amongst the institutions and with the citizens, in order to seek solutions to the current crisis. At the end of this period we will have to draw conclusions that allow us to move forward and complete the political union.\nFourthly, to be consistent with how we acted in January 2005, a positive result from this period of reflection would be to maintain the current text, which would only be possible with the appropriate measures. We shall then define the appropriate measures.\nGiven the current political context, we can say that there are new elements on the basis of which we can move ahead with the Constitution and refute two positions: firstly, the statement that the Constitution is dead \u2013 well, reports of its death have been grossly exaggerated \u2013 and, secondly, the idea that we must first deal with unemployment, immigration or fighting crime, a view which ignores the fact that, in order to do so, we need this Constitution.

I believe that languages are a vehicle for communication rather than for isolation.\nI believe, Mr President, that this report makes three important points. Mr Dehaene and Mr Stubb have already said some important things on this issue, but there are three points that I would like to mention.\nFirstly, this Constitution is the result of a consensus and, until we have an alternative menu, this is what we have. And it is a good consensus because those people who have voted \u2018no\u2019 in certain countries of the European Union are incapable of having a coffee together or of producing an alternative text. That is the reality. Those who say \u2018no\u2019 are people who reject but do not build. They are not proposing anything. Until there is another menu on the table, I shall stick to this menu and this Parliament will stick to this menu.\nSecondly, we are against the partial application of aspects of the Constitution. Why? For the same reason: because the Constitution is the result of a consensus and we are not all in agreement with all of it, but we agree with it as a whole and we would not therefore accept \u2212 and this Parliament is right to state this in its report \u2212 the idea of taking one thing but not another. We agree with everything as a whole but we do not agree with cherry-picking .\nThirdly, this Parliament states in this report that there will not be any new enlargements of the European Union without a Constitution, and it has good reason. We are aware that the Union will not operate, either in democratic terms or in terms of efficiency, without the provisions laid down in the Constitution. This appears in Article 49 of the current Treaties, Mr President, and I address this to our ostrich friends, because this Parliament must give its opinion on any enlargement of the European Union and, through this report, this Parliament is making a very clear and solemn commitment: there will be no enlargements without a Constitution.", "lang": "ES", "original": "\u00cd\u00f1igo M\u00e9ndez de Vigo (PPE-DE). \u2013 (ES) Se\u00f1or Presidente, espero que se me entienda, porque voy a hablar en una lengua oficial. Creo que las lenguas son veh\u00edculo de comunicaci\u00f3n y no de aislamiento.\nCreo que este informe, se\u00f1or Presidente, establece tres puntos importantes. Mis colegas Dehaene y Stubb ya han dicho cosas importantes sobre este tema, pero hay tres puntos que quiero se\u00f1alar.\nEn primer lugar, esta Constituci\u00f3n es fruto de un consenso y, mientras no haya un men\u00fa alternativo, esto es lo que tenemos. Y es un buen consenso porque los que han votado \u00abno\u00bb en alg\u00fan pa\u00eds de la Uni\u00f3n Europea son incapaces de tomar un caf\u00e9 juntos, incapaces de producir un texto alternativo. Esa es la realidad. Los del \u00abno\u00bb son gente que rechaza pero no construye, no propone nada. En tanto en cuanto no haya otro men\u00fa sobre la mesa, yo estoy con este men\u00fa y este Parlamento est\u00e1 con este men\u00fa.\nEn segundo lugar, estamos en contra de la aplicaci\u00f3n parcial de aspectos de la Constituci\u00f3n. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9? Por la misma idea, porque la Constituci\u00f3n es fruto de un consenso y todos no estamos de acuerdo con todo, pero estamos de acuerdo con la globalidad y, por tanto, no aceptar\u00edamos \u2212y hace bien este Parlamento en decirlo en este informe\u2212 coger esto pero no aquello.

The Duff/Voggenhuber report has sparked lively debates, and is as such part of Commissioner Wallstr\u00f6m\u2019s Plan D.\nWhat has come out of our deliberations is, then, something very encouraging: the overwhelming majority in this House holds fast to the European constitution. Far from disappearing, the reasons for the new European treaty have become more pressing: greater effectiveness, more transparency, more democracy. All the reforms and advances that the constitution brings with it are urgently needed. The debates in the Netherlands and France have done nothing to consign them to oblivion. I am very glad that the Austrian Presidency is breathing new life into this debate. Over the last few months, we have been in some sense paralysed. What we need for 2006 is a wide-ranging debate in all twenty-five countries, and I can tell the President of the Council and the Vice-President that I hope all twenty-five of them will make their contribution. I have seen the interim report from the December summit; it left a great deal to be desired. In most of the Member States, the debate has not even begun yet, and so it would be quite wrong, now, in January 2006, to present the results of a debate even before we have had one. What we have to do now is spend a year discussing the great issues of European policy with all the stakeholders in all the Member States, and then we will be able, in 2007, to come to conclusions as to which procedure we opt for to bring this project to a successful conclusion. There are various options available to us; my country\u2019s Chancellor has asked why we do not extend the constitution by adding on to it a protocol on the social Europe, and that is a way forward that we should discuss.\nThis period of reflection will endow us, and European democracy, with new strength.

Dann kann man 2007 Schlussfolgerungen ziehen, welches Verfahren wir w\u00e4hlen, um dieses Projekt erfolgreich zu Ende zu f\u00fchren. Dazu gibt es verschiedene Optionen. Meine Kanzlerin hat gesagt: Warum nicht die Verfassung verl\u00e4ngern, indem wir ein Protokoll \u00fcber das soziale Europa oder das Europa der Identit\u00e4ten anh\u00e4ngen?

Although it is true that the Constitutional Treaty has been rejected more on account of context than text, it is also true that the text of the Constitutional Treaty proved too weak to solve the problems in context. It lacked a sufficient number of bold and engaging ideas.\nWhy do we not give the citizens real power and get them to directly elect the President of the Commission, for example, or create the possibility of a European collective referendum \u2013 so not 25 or 27 small referendums, but a true European referendum \u2013 or why do we not create a truly European political space, in other words a European res publica ?\nWith regard to context, the Dutch citizens \u2013 like, I assume, those in most other Member States too \u2013 do not in any event want to discuss the institutions for the moment, thank you very much. What they do want is a Europe that becomes competitive, creates jobs, combats terrorism and cross-border crime, that pursues proper external policy, and that, at long last, simply does what it is expected to do. If we do not succeed, then, breathing new life into a Treaty review is like flogging a dead horse and all talk then becomes academic.\nCertainly, we need a new Treaty in order to make Europe more democratic and more efficient, but there is no rush. Some of the many excellent ideas which our rapporteurs have floated are intended to extend the period of reflection to late-2007, to keep more options open and also in general, I welcome a method to indicate how we should hold the debate. What we do not need, though, is a document entitled \u2018Constitution\u2019 which frightens people off rather than involving them. After all, a rose smells just as sweetly under another name. As a result, holding onto the name and the text for dear life is for my group an insuperable problem.\nIf the solution is to submit an improved text \u2013 and I truly hope we will succeed in this, for it is important \u2013 then I am in favour of submitting it to all European citizens in a referendum, to coincide with the next European elections.", "lang": "NL", "original": "Jules Maaten (ALDE). - Voorzitter, het Grondwetsverdrag is dood, leve het Verdrag.

Debate Information\n\n**Topic:** The period of reflection: structure, subjects and context for an assessment of the debate on the EU\n**Number of Contributions:** 45 substantive contributions from MEPs and EU officials\n**Context:** European Parliament debate following the rejection of the EU Constitutional Treaty by French and Dutch voters in referendums, during the designated \"period of reflection\"\n\n## 2. Executive Summary\n\nThe debate revealed fundamental divisions about how to proceed with European integration following the constitutional crisis. Three main camps emerged with distinct approaches to the rejected Constitutional Treaty.\n\n### Pro-Constitution Revitalization Camp\n\nThe largest group, led by Andrew Duff (ALDE), Johannes Voggenhuber (Verts/ALE), and Elmar Brok (PPE-DE), advocated for salvaging the Constitutional Treaty through structured parliamentary dialogue. Duff proposed \"establishing a series of parliamentary forums to debate fundamental questions about Europe's nature and purpose\" and drawing \"the reflection period to a close at the end of 2007 with a firm, clear decision on what to do with the Treaty.\" Voggenhuber emphasized that \"the Constitution is not dead, because citizens' desire to live together freely and equally in peace in Europe persists\" and called for transforming the EU \"from an elite project into a genuine public matter (res publica).\"\n\nBrok defended the treaty's substance, arguing it \"addresses citizen criticisms by providing greater capacity for foreign and security policy action, which polls show citizens want.\" This camp viewed the rejections as communication failures rather than substantive problems with the constitutional text.\n\n### Institutional Caution Camp\n\nEU officials, including Commission Vice-President Margot Wallstr\u00f6m and Austrian Presidency representative Hans Winkler, took more cautious positions while supporting continued dialogue. Wallstr\u00f6m emphasized wanting \"a Europe for everyone, not just for some\" and rejected \"any proposal for enhanced cooperation outside the European Union institutional framework.\" She warned that \"cherry-picking could give the impression that the Union is trying to circumvent the results of national referenda.\"\n\nWinkler stressed that \"there are no quick fixes, no tricks and no shortcuts, whereby we might, so to speak, throw a bridge across the confidence gap between Europe and its citizens\" and called for broad public debate about European identity and direction.\n\n### Constitutional Rejection Camp\n\nEurosceptic members like Jens-Peter Bonde (IND/DEM), Daniel Hannan (PPE-DE), and Francis Wurtz (GUE/NGL) argued the Constitution was definitively dead. Bonde declared \"the proposed Constitution is dead! Still you urge national parliaments to break the law\" and demanded \"a free, fair and open debate with equal representation of the 'yes' and 'no' sides.\" Hannan criticized EU leaders for \"implementing constitutional provisions despite referendum rejections,\" arguing this demonstrated \"contempt for democracy.\"\n\n### Policy-Focused Alternatives\n\nSome speakers, including Paolo Costa (ALDE) and Hannes Swoboda (PSE), proposed focusing on practical policy delivery rather than constitutional debates. Costa argued that \"no democratic reform ('Plan D' for debate, dialogue, democracy) will succeed without adding 'delivery' as a fourth pillar.\" Swoboda advocated demonstrating constitutional value through \"concrete examples like common energy policy and space policy for environmental monitoring.\"\n\n### Key Areas of Contention\n\n**Democratic Legitimacy:** Sharp disagreements emerged about respecting referendum results versus continuing ratification processes. Pierre Moscovici (PSE) noted \"we cannot ignore these referendum results and proceed as if nothing happened,\" while others like \u00cd\u00f1igo M\u00e9ndez de Vigo (PPE-DE) argued \"those who voted 'no' cannot agree among themselves or propose alternatives.\"\n\n**Institutional Architecture:** Debates centered on whether existing treaties sufficed or constitutional reform remained necessary. Richard Corbett emphasized \"the status quo \u2013 that is, the current Treaties \u2013 is not sufficient for this Union in its enlarged form to function effectively or democratically.\"\n\n**Citizen Engagement:** All speakers acknowledged the need for better citizen dialogue, though they differed on objectives. Edit Bauer (PPE-DE) emphasized that \"European citizens are facing uncertainty and fear about their future,\" while Jo Leinen (PSE) argued for \"comprehensive debate throughout 2006 in all 25 countries at all levels.\"\n\n**Timeline and Process:** Significant disagreement emerged about extending the reflection period. Most supported continuing until 2007, but differed on whether this should conclude with constitutional ratification, replacement, or abandonment.\n\nThe debate highlighted the EU's fundamental challenge of reconciling institutional effectiveness with democratic legitimacy in an enlarged Union, with no clear consensus emerging on the path forward from the constitutional crisis.", "src_model": "claude", "model_type": "claude", "model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "structured": true, "incremental": false, "hierarchical": false, "grouped": false, "shuffle": false, "prompt": false, "lang": "original"}
