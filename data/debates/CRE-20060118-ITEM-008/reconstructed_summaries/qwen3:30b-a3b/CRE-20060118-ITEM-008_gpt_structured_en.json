The key points here are that he called for a \"structured, parliamentary-led period of reflection\" and wants it to produce a clear decision on the EU Treaty by the end of 2007.

Little time now remains before Parliament takes this great step, this great decision, but if I had no more than a minute in which to speak, I would use it to thank my fellow rapporteur, Mr Duff, for the extraordinary honour and pleasure of working with him on this.\nFrom him I learned that the future \u2013 by which I mean the future we share in this Europe of ours \u2013 can be found by looking in the most diverse directions, and for that I am very grateful to him. If the combination of a Green Austrian and an English Liberal is not a handicap from the word go, then I do believe that other combinations can work just as well.\nOf course, not even the harmonious notes sounded by the President of the Council\u2019s magic flute this morning could mask the crisis that is going on in Europe, and, while he did not mention it, I would like to, and I would like to say something about what is at the heart of this crisis. At the centre of this whole, newly-ignited, dispute, the disagreements we have, and the European crisis, is a single sentence uttered by the founding father of the European Union, Jean Monnet, who said, \u2018We are not uniting states; we are uniting people\u2019. That is what today\u2019s argument is about.\nAre we to have a Europe of chancelleries, governments and elites, or the union of citizens to which this constitution has opened the door? Those who talk as if the constitution were dead are rejecting the human Europe, giving the intergovernmental Europe a shot in the arm and conjuring up the ghosts of the 19th\u00a0century, those primal misfortunes from Pandora\u2019s box: nationalism, rivalry between states, the concept of the balance of power, the striving for dominance, a fragmented Europe incapable of maintaining its own peace, let alone of becoming a power for peace. That is what this dispute is about.\nBefore we entered the Chamber, there were fellow Members there to welcome us dressed as ostriches. They had no need to dress up, for we knew perfectly well who they were, and we are not blind; we know that the nationalists regarded the temporary failure of the ratification process as presenting them with an historic opportunity for a nationalist renaissance. To them, by this report, and with virtual unanimity, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs delivers a resounding \u2018no\u2019.\n(Applause)\nThe Constitution is not dead, for people\u2019s need for a future in which they can live in Europe in freedom and peace at home and abroad lives on as an objective in their hearts and minds, and the Constitution is a crucial step in moving towards a social order, a political architecture, a political space, in which such a future is possible.\nThe crisis that the report we are presenting today attempts to resolve is a crisis of confidence, the crisis of a Union that cannot tell the difference between a union of citizens and a union of states, a Union in which people\u2019s expectations are disappointed as a veritable matter of course. It has no answer to social issues, it suffers from a democracy deficit, fundamental rights are not secured, there is not enough transparency, and the power of governments is unbridled and subject to few controls. This constitution, though, is a step forward, and if it is beset by difficulties, then we will try to keep it on course.\nWhat we have conceived is a European debate; I see us as bringing the process back to the people, and that adds up to nothing less than taking the elites\u2019 project and turning it into a res publica , a popular cause.\nI hope that this House \u2013 if it adopts this report \u2013 will join us in appealing to all the parties, to the population at large, to the municipalities and regions, to the trade unions and to civil society, to carry on with this debate, to take up the future of this Europe of ours as a popular cause and to join with us in contending for it.\nWe did not envisage that this debate should be without form. We, in all the groups, agreed on six questions, covering many issues that people fight shy of talking about: the goal of European integration, the borders of Europe, the future of the economic and social model, Europe\u2019s role in the world, the area of security, freedom and law, not to mention the social issues \u2013 and, even if the constitution does not do all the things we want it to do, which it goes without saying it will not, then I do nonetheless hope that this plan brings us a good deal closer to this objective.\nPerhaps I might say one more thing about precisely where our difference with the Constitutional Affairs Committee lies. What the rapporteurs want, and what they have fought for, is another step forward rather than the continued ratification process being regarded as the end product of this debate; they want it also to be possible to improve the constitution, to retain what is at its heart and, in 2007, to revise it in a more open process and a more credible debate, with the revision to be presented to the public in a Europe-wide referendum. My hope is that, aided by the Commission\u2019s level-headedness and this House\u2019s courage, this further step may be taken.\n(Applause)", "lang": "DE", "original": "Johannes Voggenhuber (Verts/ALE), Berichterstatter . \u2013 Herr Pr\u00e4sident, Frau Kommissarin, Herr Ratspr\u00e4sident, liebe Kolleginnen und Kollegen!

Er hat nicht davon gesprochen. Ich m\u00f6chte davon sprechen, und ich m\u00f6chte vom Kern dieser Krise sprechen. All dieser neu ausgebrochene Streit, die Zerw\u00fcrfnisse, die europ\u00e4ische Krise drehen sich um einen einzigen Satz, ausgesprochen von DEM Gr\u00fcndervater der Europ\u00e4ischen Union, Jean Monnet: \u201eWir vereinigen Menschen, nicht Staaten\u201c. Der Streit, der heute gef\u00fchrt wird, geht darum.\nGibt es ein Europa der Staatskanzleien, der Regierungen, der B\u00fcrokratien, der Eliten, oder gibt es die Union der B\u00fcrger, zu der diese Verfassung den Weg ge\u00f6ffnet hat? Wer heute vom Tod der Verfassung spricht, erteilt dem Europa der Menschen eine Absage, st\u00e4rkt das Europa der Regierungen und beschw\u00f6rt die Gespenster des 19.\u00a0Jahrhunderts herauf, jene Urkrankheiten aus der B\u00fcchse der Pandora, den Nationalismus, die Rivalit\u00e4t der Staaten, das Balancedenken, das Hegemoniestreben, das Europa der Zersplitterung, das seinen eigenen Frieden nicht wahren, geschweige denn zu einer Friedensmacht werden kann. Darum wird dieser Streit gef\u00fchrt.\nDa drau\u00dfen vor dem Saal haben uns Abgeordnetenkollegen als Vogel Strau\u00df verkleidet empfangen. Sie h\u00e4tten sich nicht verkleiden m\u00fcssen, wir haben sie auch so gut erkannt, und wir sind nicht blind; wir wissen, dass das vorl\u00e4ufige Scheitern des Ratifikationsprozesses in den Augen der Nationalisten eine historische Chance f\u00fcr die Renaissance des Nationalismus ist. Dem erteilt dieses Haus in gro\u00dfer \u00dcbereinstimmung aller im Ausschuss f\u00fcr konstitutionelle Fragen vertretenen Fraktionen mit diesem Bericht eine Absage.\n(Beifall)\nDie Verfassung ist nicht tot, weil das Bed\u00fcrfnis der Menschen, in der Zukunft frei und gleich in innerem und \u00e4u\u00dferem Frieden in Europa zusammenzuleben, als Ziel in den K\u00f6pfen und Herzen der Menschen Bestand hat. Und auf dem Weg, eine Ordnung zu finden, eine politische Architektur, einen politischen Raum zu entwerfen, in dem das m\u00f6glich ist, ist die Verfassung ein entscheidender Schritt.\nWir legen heute einen Bericht vor, in dem versucht wird, eine Strategie zur Beilegung dieser Krise zu entwerfen. Es ist eine Vertrauenskrise, es ist die Krise einer Union, die zwischen der Union der B\u00fcrger und der Union der Staaten nicht unterscheiden kann, in der die Erwartungen der Menschen geradezu programmatisch entt\u00e4uscht werden. Die Antwort auf die soziale Frage fehlt, die Demokratie ist defizit\u00e4r, die Grundrechte sind nicht verankert, die Transparenz ist ungen\u00fcgend, die Macht der Regierungen wenig kontrolliert und nicht gez\u00e4hmt. Aber diese Verfassung ist ein Schritt, und wenn sie in Schwierigkeiten ist, so versuchen wir, auf diesem Weg fortzufahren.\nWir haben eine europ\u00e4ische Debatte entworfen; ich denke, wir bringen den Prozess zur\u00fcck zu den B\u00fcrgern, und das hei\u00dft nicht weniger, als aus einem Projekt der Eliten eine res publica zu machen, eine Sache der Menschen selbst.\nIch hoffe, das Haus appelliert - wenn es diesen Bericht annimmt - mit uns auch an alle Parteien, an die Bev\u00f6lkerung, an die Kommunen und Regionen, an die Gewerkschaften, an die zivile Gesellschaft, diese Debatte zu f\u00fchren und diese Zukunft Europas als res publica mit aufzunehmen und mit uns darum zu streiten.\nWir haben diese Debatte nicht unstrukturiert vorgeschlagen. Wir haben uns, quer durch die Fraktionen, auf sechs Fragen geeinigt, darunter viele tabuisierte Fragen: das Ziel der europ\u00e4ischen Integration, die Grenzen Europas, die Zukunft des \u00f6konomischen und sozialen Modells, die Rolle Europas in der Welt, die Frage des Raums von Sicherheit, Freiheit und Recht, auch die soziale Frage. Und auch wenn die Verfassung nicht alle W\u00fcnsche erf\u00fcllt - selbstverst\u00e4ndlich tut sie das nicht -, so hoffe ich, dass wir mit diesem Plan diesem Ziel einen gro\u00dfen Schritt n\u00e4her kommen.\nErlauben Sie mir nur noch ein Wort dazu, wo die Differenz zum Ausschuss f\u00fcr konstitutionelle Fragen liegt. Die Berichterstatter sind gewillt und haben darum gek\u00e4mpft, einen Schritt weiterzugehen und nicht nur die Fortsetzung des Ratifikationsprozesses als Ergebnis dieser Debatte zu sehen, sondern auch die M\u00f6glichkeit, die Verfassung zu verbessern, ihren Kern zu erhalten und 2007 einen Revisionsprozess zu beschlie\u00dfen, offener darzulegen, um die Debatte glaubw\u00fcrdiger zu machen, und eine solche Revision auch in einer europ\u00e4ischen Volksbefragung den B\u00fcrgern vorzulegen. Ich hoffe, dass bei diesem weiteren Schritt zur Besonnenheit der Kommission noch der Mut des Plenums hinzukommt.\n(Beifall)", "agenda_item": "The period of reflection: structure, subjects and context for an assessment of the debate on the EU", "debate_id": "CRE-20060118-ITEM-008", "intervention_id": "3-232", "summary_english": {"headline": "Voggenhuber Urges Citizen-Centered Debate and Reform in EU Constitutional Crisis Reflection Period", "issueSum": "The speaker addresses the ongoing constitutional crisis in the European Union following difficulties in the ratification process of the EU Constitution.

The user provided a detailed parliamentary debate summary and wants the main points from Johannes Voggenhuber's speech. First, I need to locate his contributions in the summary.\n\nLooking at the debate summary, under the \"Citizen-Centered and Publicly Driven Constitutional Reform\" section, there's a mention of Johannes Voggenhuber (Verts/ALE) and Monica Frassoni. Voggenhuber's quote is about whether the EU should be a Europe of chancelleries or citizens. The key points here are his emphasis on citizen involvement versus elite-driven processes. \n\nThe user's example response structure requires four fields: issueSum, positionSum, argSum, propSum. I need to ensure each part is correctly filled based on Voggenhuber's statements. \n\nIssueSum should capture the main issue he raised. The summary mentions his call for a citizen-centered debate. PositionSum would be his stance on this, advocating for a Europe led by citizens. The argument here is that the debate should not be confined to elites. His proposal is to have a more inclusive, citizen-driven process. \n\nI need to check if there are other points attributed to him. The summary also mentions Frassoni's part, but the user specifically asked for Voggenhuber. So I should focus only on his contributions. \n\nNo other points about Voggenhuber are present in the summary. So the response should include the issue of citizen involvement, his position supporting it, the argument that it's necessary for legitimacy, and the proposal for a citizen-led debate. \n\nI need to structure this into the JSON format as specified, making sure each field is concise and accurate.

The first is that we all wish to achieve a constitutional settlement, to make Europe more transparent, more democratic and more effective. The question is how to achieve that settlement after the French and Dutch \u2018no\u2019 votes. I was happy to see that all options regarding the Constitution remain open in your resolution. During the reflection period it is essential to listen to citizens, social partners, political parties, and national and regional parliaments without prejudging the result of the wider dialogue and debate. If we do not, this exercise will lose all its value.\nI also took note of your favourite option. Maintaining the Constitution, however, will not be possible without French and Dutch support with, if necessary, additional clarifications and measures. Recent Eurobarometer surveys have shown that European citizens\u2019 support for the concept of a Constitution for the EU has increased by two percentage points over the past five months to 63%. Therefore, as has been said many times in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, it is important to change the context rather than the text. That is why the dialogue has to focus on the European project in connection with Constitutional reform, and on the ultimate objective linked to the instruments to deliver it. It is only after the listening exercise based on the results of national debates is complete, that we will be able to draw conclusions on the best Constitutional settlement for Europe. That is also why the Commission wants to focus on policy priorities addressing citizens\u2019 concerns on growth, jobs, employment and security.\nSecondly, I fully share your resistance to proposals for core groups of certain Member States. What we want is a Europe for everyone, not just for some. The Union is in the process of consolidating the most recent accession process. We still have to work hard to ensure the smooth integration of the new Member States. My view is that any enhanced cooperation must, in all circumstances, be undertaken within the existing Treaties and remain open to all Member States.\nYou can rest assured that the Commission and myself will not support any proposal for enhanced cooperation outside the European Union institutional framework.\n(Applause)\nThirdly, it seems reasonable to me to draft final conclusions on the reflection period in 2007, under the German or Portuguese Presidency. The June 2006 European Council is clearly a major milestone in this process, but it should not be the end of it. It will, of course, be up to the European Council to decide on any potential extension of the reflection period beyond the June 2006 extension already suggested by the Austrian Presidency. In any case, as announced in Plan D, the Commission will prepare a communication for the June European Council setting out its thinking on the initial feedback received during the period of reflection, and this will be based on the national visits currently being undertaken by the President, myself and fellow Commissioners, a special Eurobarometer report, discussion forums and the 9 May conferences.\nThis synthesis report should explain the background and approach taken by the Commission over the last year, outline the initial results of the listening exercise and provide a series of conclusions for the Austrian Presidency on the next steps to be taken. This will complement the factual report that will be prepared by the Austrian Presidency on the basis of contributions from the Member States.\nFourthly, I support your rejection of piecemeal implementation of the Constitution. The reason for that is simple - it has to do with respect. Respect for those who said \u2018no\u2019 and for those who have already ratified, and respect for the institutional balance. Cherry-picking could give the impression that the Union is trying to circumvent the results of national referenda and is liable to impair the overall institutional balance.\nWe should respect the difference between our institutions and those in the Member States and, most of all, when we embark on various praiseworthy initiatives and projects we should always respect each country\u2019s democratic traditions. All of us play important, but different, roles.\nIn conclusion, I would stress that we cannot discuss these issues without entering into political debate and discussing political priorities. European citizens will see that there are political differences in Europe. This is another forum for discussing political priorities, but without it and without any discussion on constitutional matters nothing will work.

This failure, which had to do not only with national issues but also with the mood in Europe as a whole, represents a failure on the part of national politics, but also of European politics, in that we have not succeeded in justifying Europe.\nWe have to take the public\u2019s concerns seriously, not least in France and in the Netherlands; we cannot simply disregard them, but should spell out why we need this sort of Europe. That is what the period of reflection needs to be used for; it is not a period for debate on details in the constitution, but a time when Europe must be justified to people.\nIt has to be clear to us, and we have to make it clear to others, that the constitutional treaty contains things the absence of which the public formerly criticised, such as greater capacity to act in foreign and security policy matters, on which the opinion I have drafted concentrates, and which, according to all opinion surveys, is precisely what the public want. They want Europe to be represented to the outside world, and it is precisely so that it may be that there are rules in the constitution, rules that only it provides for and which we, under present conditions, cannot lay down without it. It creates a new form of subsidiarity involving the national parliaments, thereby making centralisation impossible, and backs up this concept of subsidiarity with solidarity.\nCitizens\u2019 rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights have a major part to play in this. This constitution makes the citizens into decision-making actors and also provides them with protection. It must also be clear to us that in future, for example, the President of the Commission, as head of the European executive, will emerge directly from the elections to the European Parliament, with the public having a part to play in that. That is why we should focus on the fact that Parts I and\u00a0II are the actual constitutional treaty itself, whilst Part III is the Treaty of Nice, about which there have been misunderstandings that we have not been able to eradicate, and so I am grateful to the Austrian Presidency for its willingness to put forward a \u2018road map\u2019 and glad that Germany, during its presidency, intends to take new initiatives.

Der Entwurf des Verfassungsvertrags hat im Rahmen des Konvents und der Regierungskonferenz eine Balance ergeben, die im Wesentlichen durch die nationalen Parlamente, die die st\u00e4rkste Gruppe im Verfassungskonvent bildeten, getragen wurde. Vierzehn L\u00e4nder haben ratifiziert, zwei davon durch Referendum, zwei nicht. Dieses Scheitern, das ja auch mit nationalen Fragen, aber auch mit der Stimmung in Europa insgesamt zu tun hat, ist ein Scheitern nationaler Politik, aber auch europ\u00e4ischer Politik, weil es uns nicht gelungen ist, Europa zu begr\u00fcnden.\nWir m\u00fcssen die Sorgen der B\u00fcrger ernst nehmen; wir m\u00fcssen sie auch in Frankreich und in den Niederlanden ernst nehmen und k\u00f6nnen nicht einfach dar\u00fcber hinweggehen, aber wir sollten deutlich machen, warum wir dieses Europa brauchen.

Dies ist kein Zeitraum der Debatte \u00fcber Einzelheiten der Verfassung, sondern Europa muss in den Begr\u00fcndungen zu den Menschen zur\u00fcckgebracht werden.\nDabei m\u00fcssen wir auch sehen und deutlich machen, dass der Verfassungsvertrag gerade Dinge beinhaltet, die der B\u00fcrger kritisiert, weil sie bisher fehlen, z.\u00a0B. eine gr\u00f6\u00dfere Handlungsf\u00e4higkeit im Bereich der Au\u00dfen- und Sicherheitspolitik, worauf sich meine Stellungnahme konzentriert. Alle Meinungsumfragen sagen, dass die B\u00fcrger genau das wollen: die Vertretung Europas nach au\u00dfen hin. Und daf\u00fcr bietet die Verfassung Regelungen, die nur sie vorsieht und die wir unter den gegenw\u00e4rtigen Bedingungen nicht nebenher schaffen k\u00f6nnen. Sie schafft einen neuen Weg der Subsidiarit\u00e4t unter Mitwirkung der nationalen Parlamente, um auf diese Art und Weise Zentralismus zu verhindern, und verbindet diesen Gedanken der Subsidiarit\u00e4t mit der Solidarit\u00e4t.\nDie B\u00fcrgerrechte und die Charta der Grundrechte spielen eine gro\u00dfe Rolle. Die B\u00fcrger werden durch diese Verfassung zu entscheidenden Akteuren, und sie bekommen auch den Schutz.

I know that the issues that Mr Brok has just raised have prompted a great deal of debate, not least within the political groupings in this House, and there is much to be said for both positions. Perhaps we have to begin with the issues of substance, which we may well have neglected to some degree; how, for example, can we persuade the public that Europe needs a constitution of the kind that has been drafted? I gave a number of examples in the opinion I drafted on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, and perhaps I can adduce one that did not yet count for much at the time I was writing, but has acquired significance over the past few days in this House. I refer, of course, to the issue of energy.\nIt was pretty surprising, indeed pretty astonishing, to see how many Members of this House who had, until recently, perhaps taken a rather sceptical view of such things, are now forthright advocates of a common energy policy; I was delighted to hear what Mr Saryusz-Wolski had to say on the subject. The Federal Chancellor is a constant advocate of subsidiarity; today, as President of the Council, he argued strongly in favour of a common energy policy. This is just one example showing how important it is that the powers and prerogatives that we, particularly in the Constitution, have accorded to the European level be used to the utmost. I see this as the road down which we must go.\nI could, at this point, for example, talk about space policy, which has been another topic for debate in this place, and which is not about sending Europeans into space, but rather about monitoring the environment or giving warnings of tsunamis in good time. There are plenty of other things that are realistic and feasible and capable of being explained to the public if we focus on matters of substance rather than the institutional issues.\nWhat we in this House expect, of course, is a road map or sketch of how things are to progress. I beg you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in all the weighty matters with which you will have to deal over the coming weeks and months of this Presidency, to highlight how much better we could handle them if we had a European constitution.

The user provided a detailed parliamentary debate summary and wants the main points from Hannes Swoboda (PSE). First, I need to locate where Swoboda is mentioned in the debate summary.\n\nLooking through the sections, under the \"Rebuilding Trust, Legitimacy, and Public Ownership\" section, there's a mention of Hannes Swoboda (PSE). The summary states that he and Elmar Brok argued the focus should be less on renegotiating treaty details and more on explaining and justifying the EU's necessity to citizens, using substantive policy areas like energy to show tangible benefits.\n\nSo, the key points here are Swoboda's position on shifting focus from treaty details to explaining the EU's value. The argument is that this approach would better address citizen concerns. The proposal is to use policy areas like energy as examples. \n\nI need to make sure I don't include other speakers' points. The user specified to only include Swoboda's arguments. The summary mentions he and Brok both made this point, but the user is asking about Swoboda specifically. However, the example response in the query includes both speakers, but the user's instruction says to only include the points attributed to the speaker in question. Wait, the user says \"Contributions or arguments from other speakers should not be included in your response.\" So even if Swoboda is mentioned with Brok, I should only include Swoboda's part. But in the given debate summary, the text says \"Elmar Brok (PPE-DE) and Hannes Swoboda (PSE) argued the focus should be less on renegotiating treaty details and more on 'explaining and justifying the necessity of the EU to its citizens' [Brok], using substantive policy areas like energy to demonstrate tangible benefits [Swoboda].\"\n\nSo the argument about using energy policy is specifically attributed to Swoboda. Therefore, in the response, I need to structure:\n\nissueSum: Rebuilding trust and legitimacy by focusing on explaining EU's necessity to citizens.\n\npositionSum: Focus on explaining EU's necessity rather than treaty details.\n\nargSum: To address citizen concerns and demonstrate tangible benefits.\n\npropSum: Use substantive policy areas like energy to show benefits.\n\nI need to make sure that the JSON only includes Swoboda's points. The example given in the user's query includes both speakers, but the user's instruction says to only include the points attributed to the specific speaker. So in this case, Swoboda's contribution is the part about using energy policy. So the position is about shifting focus, the argument is to address citizen concerns, and the proposal is using energy as an example.\n\nI need to check if there's any other mention of Swoboda in the summary.

With the referendum on the Constitution in France and the Netherlands, the citizens who wanted to get in and watch from the terraces went beyond that and organised an actual invasion of the pitch. Today\u2019s crisis in Europe also lies in the fact that it is no longer possible to go back behind closed doors, back to the Europe of the Treaties and elitist decisions, and that, at the same time, no one knows how to get the people back onto the terraces so that they can express their opinions properly as fans normally do.\nReinventing a system of participation and accountability, whereby the Union answers directly to the citizens, without the self-seeking, distorting and misleading mediation of the Member States, is a prerequisite for setting the European project in motion again, whatever its new content may be. The question is, however, accountability for what? We must avoid the mistake of turning the pause for reflection into a pause of inaction.\nNo Plan D will be a success if, in addition to the \u2018D\u2019 for \u2018debate\u2019, \u2018dialogue\u2019 and \u2018democracy\u2019, it does not also include \u2018D\u2019 for \u2018delivery\u2019. Delivery is the best context in which to recast the text of the Constitution, and the best way to make people understand just how useful Europe can be. That is why even self-inflicted failures, like today\u2019s de facto refusal to regulate market access to port services, can become symbolically dangerous.\nThere are areas of recognised European competence in which the existing treaties already provide for qualified majority voting and the interinstitutional codecision procedure \u2013 transport is one example. There are also areas where subsidiarity should properly be interpreted in reverse: not letting the Member States do badly what can be done better at a European level. In these areas of competence, the Union must raise its delivery rate and dare to show how useful it can be.\nToday it is no longer enough to see the Union merely as a clever solution to the problems of war, including the Cold War. What we need is a Union that is equal to the global challenges of the third millennium.

It may therefore have come as a surprise that I was appointed to draft the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development in respect of the report on the period of reflection following the rejection of the Constitution. I consider this a sign of the openness with which our Committee approached this issue. The principle of audiatur et altera pars \u2013 let the other side be heard \u2013 is one of the fundamental preconditions for real dialogue.\nMy views provoked constructive debate in committee, resulting in a compromise that was well thought through, and anything but toothless. The report was endorsed by every member of the Committee, with no votes against, and four abstentions. This demonstrates that dialogue on the future of the Union is possible. Our report in fact advocates principles that are missing from the report of Mr Duff and Mr Voggenhuber. I refer in particular to the principle of legal precaution, by which we should be guided, so that we do not, in the regulations which we approve during the period of reflection, constantly refer to a Constitution that is currently dead from a legal standpoint but which might be resurrected in its original form. It is na\u00efve and misguided to believe that the more often we refer to the Constitution the more we will boost its chances for resuscitation. Such rules may needlessly be undermined at some future point.\nOur Committee\u2019s report also recommends that we enter into cooperation with the institutions of national and regional parliaments, which possess a high degree of qualification and legitimacy, and that we do this more than just once a year for the sake of appearances, as recommended in the report before us today. Unfortunately, there are other parts of the report that strike a discordant note, the most surprising of which is that it sets out what the result of open dialogue ought to be. It evens states that the now dead Constitution is to be ratified in 2009. This is tantamount to trampling over the democratic will of the people of at least two EU Member States. If we are to prescribe the outcome of dialogue in advance, if we reduce dialogue to the level of a stage-managed performance involving unrepresentative bodies, if we continue to spend money in such a way that only the most gratifying opinions are heard, the EU will never have any chance of developing effective structures.", "lang": "CS", "original": "Vladim\u00edr \u017delezn\u00fd (IND/DEM), Navrhovatel V\u00fdboru pro region\u00e1ln\u00ed rozvoj . \u2013 Jsem hrd\u00fdm \u010dlenem skupiny IND/DEM, kter\u00e1 b\u00fdv\u00e1 nep\u0159\u00edli\u0161 p\u0159esn\u011b ozna\u010dov\u00e1na za euroskeptickou, a tak mo\u017en\u00e1 p\u0159ekvap\u00ed, \u017ee zpravodajov\u00e1n\u00ed stanoviska V\u00fdboru pro region\u00e1ln\u00ed rozvoj k dokumentu o obdob\u00ed reflexe po por\u00e1\u017ece \u00dastavy bylo sv\u011b\u0159eno pr\u00e1v\u011b m\u011b.

This House has had a long fight where codecision in agricultural matters is concerned, and the draft constitution\u2019s incorporation of codecision \u2013 which goes back to the Treaties of Amsterdam \u2013 in the fields of environmental protection, food safety and the protection of consumers is something to be welcomed. Where agricultural policy is concerned, however, the Council of Agriculture Ministers can still disregard the opinions of the European Parliament, since the codecision procedure is not, under the current Treaty, applicable to the common agricultural policy.\nAlthough the draft constitution, when considered in the light of the above, held out the prospect of increased democratic legitimacy, in that all decisions on agricultural policy were to be subject to codecision, the Agriculture Committee does believe that the existing text is still in need of some improvements. The objectives of the common agricultural policy, as set out in Article III-227, contradict the goals of the European Union described in Article I-3, and no longer serve any readily explainable purpose. They must, as a matter of urgency, be updated to take account of the multifunctional nature of our present agriculture, which provides work for 10 million people in the EU, is the sole guarantor of the sustainable development of rural areas and cannot be considered in isolation from them.\nThis draft constitution is not equal to the task of creating a CAP that is acceptable to society at large, and so one priority for any future treaty must be to extend codecision to the common agricultural policy, and, in particular, to close the loopholes that remain in Articles III-230 (2) and III-231 (2) of the text as it stands at present.\nSince the CAP is so very important and occupies a predominant position in the EU\u2019s Budget, the European public have every right to the highest possible degree of transparency and, above all in this sensitive area, codecision \u2013 which, as I see it, can mean nothing other than full codecision for the European Parliament on all matters relating to agricultural policy, consumer protection and the safety of food.", "lang": "DE", "original": "Willem Schuth (ALDE), Verfasser der Stellungnahme des mitberatenden Ausschusses f\u00fcr Landwirtschaft und l\u00e4ndliche Entwicklung . \u2013 Herr Pr\u00e4sident, liebe Kolleginnen und Kollegen! Zun\u00e4chst m\u00f6chte ich den Kollegen Duff und Voggenhuber zu ihrem ausgewogenen Bericht gratulieren. Ich freue mich sehr, dass ich Ihnen heute kurz die Stellungnahme des Ausschusses f\u00fcr Landwirtschaft und l\u00e4ndliche Entwicklung zu diesem Bericht vorstellen darf. Das Europ\u00e4ische Parlament hat im Agrarbereich lange um die Mitentscheidung k\u00e4mpfen m\u00fcssen. Es ist zu begr\u00fc\u00dfen, dass der Verfassungsentwurf die seit den Amsterdamer Vertr\u00e4gen festgeschriebene Mitentscheidung in den Bereichen Umweltschutz, Lebensmittelsicherheit und Verbraucherschutz \u00fcbernommen hat. Im Bereich der Agrarpolitik kann sich der Rat der Agrarminister bis heute \u00fcber die Meinung des Europ\u00e4ischen Parlaments hinwegsetzen, da das Mitentscheidungsverfahren nach dem heutigen Vertrag nicht auf die gemeinsame Agrarpolitik Anwendung findet.\nVor diesem Hintergrund stellte der Verfassungsentwurf zwar insofern einen Zugewinn an demokratischer Legitimation in Aussicht, als alle agrarpolitischen Grundsatzentscheidungen der Mitbestimmung unterliegen sollten. Aus Sicht des Landwirtschaftsausschusses bedarf es allerdings noch einiger Verbesserungen am vorliegenden Text. Die in Artikel III-227 genannten Ziele der gemeinsamen Agrarpolitik stehen im Widerspruch zu den in Artikel I-3 formulierten Zielen der Europ\u00e4ischen Union und sind nicht mehr vermittelbar. Sie m\u00fcssen dringend dahingehend aktualisiert werden, dass sie der Multifunktionalit\u00e4t unserer heutigen Landwirtschaft auch tats\u00e4chlich Rechnung tragen. Die Landwirtschaft in der EU bietet heute Arbeitspl\u00e4tze f\u00fcr 10 Millionen Menschen. Sie ist der einzige Garant f\u00fcr eine nachhaltige Entwicklung des l\u00e4ndlichen Raums und untrennbar mit ihm verbunden.\nF\u00fcr eine f\u00fcr die Gesellschaft akzeptierbare GAP reicht der vorliegende Verfassungsentwurf nicht aus. Vielmehr sollte im Rahmen eines k\u00fcnftigen Vertrags das Mitentscheidungsverfahren priorit\u00e4r auf die gemeinsame Agrarpolitik ausgeweitet werden, wobei insbesondere die in den Artikeln III-230 Absatz 2 sowie III-231 Absatz 2 des vorliegenden Textes verbliebenen L\u00fccken im Agrarbereich geschlossen werden k\u00f6nnten.\nAngesichts der gro\u00dfen Bedeutung der GAP und ihrer herausragenden Stellung im Haushalt der EU verdienen die europ\u00e4ischen B\u00fcrger ein H\u00f6chstma\u00df an Transparenz und vor allem Mitbestimmung in diesem sensiblen Bereich.

First, I need to check if Willem Schuth is mentioned in the debate summary.\n\nLooking through the provided summary, the main themes and speaker positions are listed with names like Andrew Duff, Hans Winkler, Margot Wallstr\u00f6m, Elmar Brok, etc. I'll scan each section to see if Willem Schuth is mentioned. \n\nScrolling through the sections: \n\n- Structured, Inclusive Debate & Institutional Collaboration: Names like Duff, Winkler, Wallstr\u00f6m. No Schuth here.\n- Rebuilding Trust, Legitimacy, and Public Ownership: Brok, Swoboda, Costa, Sz\u00e1jer.

No.\n- Calls for Democratic Innovation: Maaten. Not Schuth.\n- Criticism and Calls for Respect for Rejection: Allister, Gollnisch, Knapman. No.\n\nThe conclusion sections don't mention Schuth either. The user's example response includes a speaker not in the provided summary. Wait, the user's example might be a placeholder. But in the actual debate summary given, there's no mention of Willem Schuth. \n\nSo, the answer should be an empty JSON because the speaker isn't referenced. The user's instruction says if no points, respond with empty string. But the JSON structure requires empty strings for each field. Wait, the user's example shows that if there are no points, the response is an empty string. But the instructions say to respond in JSON with empty strings for each key if there's nothing. Wait, the user says: \"If this is the case, respond with an empty string.\" But the example shows a JSON. Hmm, maybe the user made a mistake. However, the strict instruction is to respond with an empty string if no points. But the JSON structure is required. Wait, the user says: \"You must respond in json format. Outputs must be parseable by json.loads(). You will structure your response as json with the following structure... If this is the case, respond with an empty string.\"\n\nWait, the user's example shows a JSON, but the instruction says if no points, respond with an empty string. That's conflicting. But according to the user's exact instruction: \"If this is the case, respond with an empty string.\" So perhaps the correct answer is an empty string, but the user's example shows a JSON. However, the user also says \"You must respond in json format.\" So maybe the correct approach is to return an empty JSON object, but the user's example shows that when there are no points, the response is an empty string. But JSON can't be an empty string; it's either a JSON object or a string. This is confusing. However, the user's example shows a JSON, so perhaps even if there are no points, the JSON should be empty. But according to the user's instruction, if there are no points, respond with an empty string. But the user also says to structure the response as JSON. This is conflicting. However, given the user's exact words: \"If this is the case, respond with an empty string.\" So the answer should be an empty string. But the user's example shows a JSON. Maybe the user made a mistake. But to comply with the instruction, I'll return an empty string. However, the user's example shows a JSON. But the user says \"You must respond in json format.

I hope that that state of affairs is now a thing of the past.\nI have had the honour of drafting the Legal Affairs Committee\u2019s opinion, which is very much in line with the content of this draft report from the lead Committee. The Legal Affairs Committee\u2019s particular concern has been that we should not prematurely abandon the present draft constitution. In the subject areas that really matter to us, such as the composition and powers of the European Court of Justice, the reordering of the lawmaking process and comitology procedure, and judicial cooperation, we simply do not see that a completely new start would enable us to make any real improvements; indeed, it is more likely to have the opposite effect. While I do regret having had to listen today to the Austrian Presidency\u2019s critical views of the powers of the European Court of Justice and the fact that such criticism comes now not only from that source, it does lead me to think that the solutions provided in this draft constitution really are very good after all.\nWe have good legal reasons for objecting to any hasty division of the draft Constitution. Part I contains a very large number of fundamental principles, and we all know that it was only the derogations contained in Part III that made them politically acceptable. We also, albeit with some regret, have good legal reasons for regarding Parts I and III as connected, and no new structure will be possible without fundamental reworking of Part III.\nI will conclude by expressing my grave disappointment with the letter from the three presidents of national parliaments. The sight of many former members of the Convention in this Chamber reminds me of the dedication with which members of the national parliaments worked with us on the draft constitution, of the important proposals they had to make, and, in view of that, I simply cannot regard this letter from the three presidents as being the last word on the subject.", "lang": "DE", "original": "Maria Berger (PSE), Verfasserin der Stellungnahme des mitberatenden Rechtsausschusses . \u2013 Herr Pr\u00e4sident!

The key quote is: \"The Legal Affairs Committee\u2019s particular concern has been that we should not prematurely abandon the present draft constitution.\" Also, another part mentions she and others defended the existing draft, calling for neither abandonment nor piecemeal application.\n\nSo, the issue here is the EU Constitution's future. Her position is to defend the existing draft. The argument is about not abandoning the draft prematurely. The proposal is to maintain the current constitution without changes. \n\nI need to make sure I don't include other speakers' points. The user specified only Maria Berger's contributions.

What does this opinion say? First of all, it points out all the improvements provided for by the Constitution in relation to the current Treaties. The improvements in terms of security, liberty and justice were many and significant and, above all, they were the subject of consensus on the part of the nations comprising Europe.\nI am not going to list them all, but I shall simply mention four points that are likely to get us over this bad patch and that the excellent report by my colleagues, Mr\u00a0Duff and Mr\u00a0Voggenhuber has put back on the agenda.\nFirstly, the widespread introduction of qualified majority voting and the simplification of the legislative acts enable us to devise a policy rather than be thwarted by the finer points of such a policy. Next, the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, which is a factory of Community law when Parliament is at a loss, is extended. The definitive strengthening of Parliament\u2019s role as co-legislator might also be mentioned, this being something that we need to promote. Finally, integrating the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the very wording of the Constitution confers legal value upon the latter. There are, of course, other positive points, but those I have just listed are genuinely fundamental.\nForgive my alluding to these possibilities still open to us, but I wanted to emphasise the advances entailed by this Constitution in an area not discussed throughout the EU Member States, namely that of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the area of freedom, justice and security. Therein lies, indeed, the material for constructing a framework right now, pending the advent of a new document. Why, therefore, do the Member States not take more advantage of this material in order to try to bind together again an EU that is being given a rough ride?\nFinally, we consider it a matter of priority systematically to take account of the impact of EU policies on fundamental rights and, so that we might not delay in presenting an initial bill, we emphasise how urgent it is to set up an independent Agency for Fundamental Rights, as requested by Parliament on 26\u00a0May 2005.", "lang": "FR", "original": "Jean-Marie Cavada (ALDE), rapporteur pour avis de la commission des libert\u00e9s civiles, de la justice et des affaires int\u00e9rieures . - Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, Monsieur Winkler, Madame Wallstr\u00f6m, la commission des libert\u00e9s civiles a adopt\u00e9 \u00e0 une large majorit\u00e9, le 28\u00a0novembre dernier, l'avis que je lui avais pr\u00e9par\u00e9.

Seldom do we discuss more important issues than the one we are discussing now. Our thanks should go to the rapporteurs who have taken the initiative and, on the basis of broad-ranging discussions, have presented this topic.\nThe future of Europe is our common problem, equally important for the young and the elderly, for men and women. As Mrs\u00a0Wallstr\u00f6m has emphasised, most European citizens see no problem in the decision-making mechanisms of the European institutions. Their problem is primarily a lack of clarity in the vision they have of their own future, their prospects, their security and the new challenges which they are still struggling to find a response to.\nUncertainty and fear of the future were clearly the main factors behind the NO outcome in the votes on the Constitution. Clearly, we are all responsible for finding a way forwards. Those of us here at the European Parliament should be aware of the messages and signals we are sending out when we take decisions, for instance, on cohesion instruments or the transfer of pension rights or when we give preferential treatment to migrants from third countries rather than to the citizens of new Member States.\nThe governments of Member States must bear their share of responsibility for frequently behaving as if European matters, such as the work-life balance goals formulated in the Lisbon Strategy, do not concern them. A fundamental question remains as to whether we will be able to develop a sufficiently appealing common vision and as to whether our European values will be strong enough to produce an adequate level of social cohesion.\nMr President, women account for more than [half] of all European citizens and voters. They have their own specific problems, which call for a sensitive approach and satisfactory solutions. The views of women should therefore be accorded sufficiently serious consideration in the forthcoming debate. Mr President, I would like to emphasise in conclusion that, in the opinion of the Committee for Women\u2019s Rights and Gender Equality, a repeat of the split between the core countries of Europe and the remaining ones would be one of the worst possible outcomes of our efforts to find a way forwards.", "lang": "SK", "original": "Edit Bauer (PPE-DE), Spravodajky\u0148a V\u00fdboru pre pr\u00e1va \u017eien a rovnos\u0165 pohlav\u00ed po\u017eiadan\u00e9ho o stanovisko . \u2013 V\u00e1\u017een\u00fd p\u00e1n predseda, p\u00e1n Winkler, pani komis\u00e1rka, zriedkakedy hovor\u00edme o d\u00f4le\u017eitej\u0161\u00edch ot\u00e1zkach, ako pr\u00e1ve teraz.

It is for the European Parliament to define the framework and the arrangements for these debates, to have the national parliaments and civil society take part in them, to specify the questions and to draw up the necessary agenda.

First, I need to check if Geremek is mentioned in the debate summary.\n\nLooking through the sections, the main themes and speaker positions are listed with various names like Andrew Duff, Hans Winkler, Margot Wallstr\u00f6m, etc. I'll scan each subsection. The names mentioned include Elmar Brok, Hannes Swoboda, Paolo Costa, J\u00f3zsef Sz\u00e1jer, Johannes Voggenhuber, Monica Frassoni, Francis Wurtz, Jens-Peter Bonde, Irena Belohorsk\u00e1, Vladimir \u017delezn\u00fd, Daniel Hannan, Nils Lundgren, Maria Berger, Carlos Carnero Gonz\u00e1lez, Jean-Luc Dehaene, Jo Leinen, \u00cd\u00f1igo M\u00e9ndez de Vigo, Pierre Moscovici, Ignasi Guardans Camb\u00f3, Edit Bauer, Sylvia-Yvonne Kaufmann, Jules Maaten, James Hugh Allister, Bruno Gollnisch, Roger Knapman. \n\nWait, I don't see Bronis\u0142aw Geremek listed here. The user might have made a mistake or maybe he's mentioned in another part. Let me check again. The debate summary has a section titled \"Main Themes and Speaker Positions\" with several subpoints. Each subpoint lists specific speakers. For example, under \"Citizen-Centered and Publicly Driven Constitutional Reform,\" the speakers are Johannes Voggenhuber, Monica Frassoni, Francis Wurtz, Jens-Peter Bonde. \n\nLooking through all the names, I don't see Bronis\u0142aw Geremek mentioned anywhere. The user's instruction says that if there are no points attributed to the speaker, respond with an empty string. So, in this case, since Geremek isn't mentioned in the provided debate summary, the correct response would be an empty JSON object.\n\nBut wait, maybe I missed something. Let me do a quick search for \"Bronis\u0142aw Geremek\" in the text. The summary is quite long, but skimming through again, there's no mention of that name.

The European Union needs a democratic Constitution and cannot just stumble along with Nice. The debate that must take place on the Constitution has to be a European debate, and the letter sent by the three presidents of national parliaments shows that responsibility for the debate cannot be left at national level, but that there is a need for a truly European body, like this Parliament, to conduct it and \u2013 all right, yes, we must say it openly \u2013 to steer it as well.\nTwo things are missing in the report, however, and we hope to be able to introduce them with the vote in this House. In fact, Mr\u00a0Corbett, I do not agree with you: it is absolutely not true that the movement of those who voted \u2018yes\u2019 to the Constitution is split between those who now want to get rid of the text and those who want to keep it. It is not like that. The amendment that we shall put to the vote tomorrow explicitly states that one possibility \u2013 not a theoretical one, but a practical one \u2013 might be to change the text and that, if that were to happen, it would require a new constitutional process, which might also end with a referendum.\nTo think, however, that the only proposal that we, as the European Parliament, should put forward is to maintain the current text and nothing else is false and short-sighted, and it is that attitude that might really divide the pro-European movement, that is to say the movement that obtained broad support for the Constitution in this House, with 500 votes.\nI therefore believe that the two amendments tabled by the rapporteurs should be supported by a large majority in this Parliament, because they simply state that it is possible to debate various options. Perhaps no option is better than the others, but I believe that they should all be discussed, including the one that right now sounds strangely drastic, which is that we should reopen the debate on the Constitution with the citizens as well.\n(Applause)", "lang": "IT", "original": "Monica Frassoni, a nome del gruppo Verts/ALE . \u2013 Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, il gruppo dei Verdi/Alleanza libera europea sostiene la relazione Duff-Voggenhuber.

The user provided a detailed debate summary and wants the response for Francis Wurtz. First, I need to find where Francis Wurtz is mentioned in the debate summary.\n\nLooking through the sections, under the \"Democratic Legitimacy and Legal Precaution\" section, there's a mention of Francis Wurtz. The summary states: \"Francis Wurtz (GUE/NGL), and Jens-Peter Bonde (IND/DEM), questioned Parliament's intent, suggesting the reflection period was becoming 'a communication campaign' rather than 'substantive assessment and transformation' [Wurtz]; Bonde demanded 'a free, fair and open debate with equal representation of the \u2018yes\u2019 and \u2018no\u2019 sides' [Bonde].\"\n\nSo, Francis Wurtz's main point is that the reflection period is turning into a communication campaign instead of a real assessment. His position is critical of the process, wanting it to be more substantive. The argument here is that the current approach isn't genuine. However, the user's example response includes issue, position, argument, and proposal summaries. \n\nBut in the given debate summary, there's no mention of proposals from Wurtz, only his criticism. The example includes \"propSum\" even if there's no actual proposal, but the user's instruction says if there's no points, return an empty string. So I need to check if Wurtz made any proposals. \n\nLooking back, the summary only says he questioned the intent and suggested it's a communication campaign. There's no specific proposal mentioned. So \"propSum\" would be empty. \n\nSo structuring the JSON: \n\nissueSum would be about the reflection period being a communication campaign. \n\npositionSum: he questioned the intent, suggesting it's not substantive. \n\nargSum: the argument is that it's a communication campaign instead of substantive. \n\npropSum: none, so empty string.\n\nWait, but the user's example has \"propSum\" even if there's no proposal. But according to the instructions, if there's no points, return empty. So in this case, since there's no proposal mentioned, propSum is empty.\n\nSo the final JSON should have:\n\nissueSum: \"The issue raised by the speaker is that the reflection period is being transformed into a communication campaign rather than a substantive assessment and transformation.\"\n\npositionSum: \"He questioned the Parliament's intent, suggesting the reflection period was becoming a communication campaign instead of a substantive assessment and transformation.\"\n\nargSum: \"His argument is that the reflection period is not being used as a genuine opportunity for assessment and transformation but rather as a means of communication.\"\n\npropSum: \"\"\n\nI need to make sure not to include anything else from other speakers. The user's example also has \"issueSum\" as a summary of key issues, so here the key issue is the reflection period's purpose. Position is his stance, argument is why he thinks that, and prop is nothing.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The issue raised by the speaker is that the reflection period is being transformed into a communication campaign rather than a substantive assessment and transformation.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"He questioned the Parliament's intent, suggesting the reflection period was becoming a communication campaign instead of a substantive assessment and transformation.\",\n\"argSum\": \"His argument is that the reflection period is not being used as a genuine opportunity for assessment and transformation but rather as a means of communication.\",\n\"propSum\": \"\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "gpt-4.1", "generator_model_type": "gpt", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "gpt"}, {"speaker": "Jens-Peter Bonde,", "english": "Jens-Peter Bonde, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . \u2013 Mr President, I should like to ask the ostrich majority in this House: have you not heard that 55% of French voters voted \u2018no\u2019, against the advice of 90% of their deputies and senators?

Wait, the user is asking about Bastiaan Belder, but in the provided debate summary, I don't see any direct quotes or mentions of him. The speaker names listed in the summary include people like Andrew Duff, Hans Winkler, Margot Wallstr\u00f6m, Elmar Brok, etc., but not Bastiaan Belder. \n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The user mentioned \"Speaker Name: Bastiaan Belder (IND/DEM).\" But in the provided debate summary, under the \"Conclusions & Recommendations\" section, there's a mention of \"IND/DEM\" in the context of Jens-Peter Bonde. However, there's no specific mention of Bastiaan Belder. \n\nSo, if there's no information about Bastiaan Belder in the debate summary provided, then according to the instructions, I should return an empty string. The user's note says that if there are no points attributed to the speaker, respond with an empty string. \n\nTherefore, the correct response would be an empty JSON object. But wait, the example response shows that even if there's no data, the keys are present. However, the user's instruction says to respond with an empty string if there are no points. Wait, no, the user says: \"If this is the case, respond with an empty string.\" But the example shows a JSON structure. Wait, the user's instruction says: \"You must respond in json format. Outputs must be parseable by json.loads(). You will structure your response as json with the following structure: example response...\" \n\nBut if there are no points, the user says to respond with an empty string. However, an empty string is not valid JSON. Maybe the user means to return an empty JSON object. But the example shows that even if there's no data, the keys are present. Wait, the example response has the keys, but the values are empty strings. For example:\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"\",\n\"positionSum\": \"\",\n\"argSum\": \"\",\n\"propSum\": \"\"\n}\n\nBut the user's instruction says: \"If this is the case, respond with an empty string.\" So maybe the entire JSON should be an empty string. But that's not valid. Maybe the user made a mistake, but following the instructions strictly, if there's no information, return an empty string. However, the example shows a JSON structure. \n\nBut in the problem statement, the user says: \"If this is the case, respond with an empty string.\" So perhaps the correct answer is an empty string. However, the user also says \"You must respond in json format.\" So there's a conflict. But given the example, perhaps the user expects the JSON structure with empty strings. \n\nBut in this case, since there's no mention of Bastiaan Belder in the debate summary, the correct answer is that there are no points. Therefore, the JSON should have all empty strings. But the user's example shows that even if there's no data, the keys are present.

I believe that languages are a vehicle for communication rather than for isolation.\nI believe, Mr President, that this report makes three important points. Mr Dehaene and Mr Stubb have already said some important things on this issue, but there are three points that I would like to mention.\nFirstly, this Constitution is the result of a consensus and, until we have an alternative menu, this is what we have. And it is a good consensus because those people who have voted \u2018no\u2019 in certain countries of the European Union are incapable of having a coffee together or of producing an alternative text. That is the reality. Those who say \u2018no\u2019 are people who reject but do not build. They are not proposing anything. Until there is another menu on the table, I shall stick to this menu and this Parliament will stick to this menu.\nSecondly, we are against the partial application of aspects of the Constitution. Why? For the same reason: because the Constitution is the result of a consensus and we are not all in agreement with all of it, but we agree with it as a whole and we would not therefore accept \u2212 and this Parliament is right to state this in its report \u2212 the idea of taking one thing but not another. We agree with everything as a whole but we do not agree with cherry-picking .\nThirdly, this Parliament states in this report that there will not be any new enlargements of the European Union without a Constitution, and it has good reason. We are aware that the Union will not operate, either in democratic terms or in terms of efficiency, without the provisions laid down in the Constitution. This appears in Article 49 of the current Treaties, Mr President, and I address this to our ostrich friends, because this Parliament must give its opinion on any enlargement of the European Union and, through this report, this Parliament is making a very clear and solemn commitment: there will be no enlargements without a Constitution.", "lang": "ES", "original": "\u00cd\u00f1igo M\u00e9ndez de Vigo (PPE-DE). \u2013 (ES) Se\u00f1or Presidente, espero que se me entienda, porque voy a hablar en una lengua oficial.

Mis colegas Dehaene y Stubb ya han dicho cosas importantes sobre este tema, pero hay tres puntos que quiero se\u00f1alar.\nEn primer lugar, esta Constituci\u00f3n es fruto de un consenso y, mientras no haya un men\u00fa alternativo, esto es lo que tenemos. Y es un buen consenso porque los que han votado \u00abno\u00bb en alg\u00fan pa\u00eds de la Uni\u00f3n Europea son incapaces de tomar un caf\u00e9 juntos, incapaces de producir un texto alternativo. Esa es la realidad. Los del \u00abno\u00bb son gente que rechaza pero no construye, no propone nada. En tanto en cuanto no haya otro men\u00fa sobre la mesa, yo estoy con este men\u00fa y este Parlamento est\u00e1 con este men\u00fa.\nEn segundo lugar, estamos en contra de la aplicaci\u00f3n parcial de aspectos de la Constituci\u00f3n. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9?

Estamos de acuerdo con todo pero no en hacer el cherry picking.\nEn tercer lugar, este Parlamento dice en este informe que no habr\u00e1 nuevas ampliaciones de la Uni\u00f3n Europea sin Constituci\u00f3n, y no es una casualidad. Nosotros somos conscientes de que la Uni\u00f3n no funcionar\u00e1, ni democr\u00e1ticamente ni eficazmente, sin las prescripciones que establece la Constituci\u00f3n.

The Duff/Voggenhuber report has sparked lively debates, and is as such part of Commissioner Wallstr\u00f6m\u2019s Plan D.\nWhat has come out of our deliberations is, then, something very encouraging: the overwhelming majority in this House holds fast to the European constitution. Far from disappearing, the reasons for the new European treaty have become more pressing: greater effectiveness, more transparency, more democracy. All the reforms and advances that the constitution brings with it are urgently needed. The debates in the Netherlands and France have done nothing to consign them to oblivion. I am very glad that the Austrian Presidency is breathing new life into this debate. Over the last few months, we have been in some sense paralysed. What we need for 2006 is a wide-ranging debate in all twenty-five countries, and I can tell the President of the Council and the Vice-President that I hope all twenty-five of them will make their contribution. I have seen the interim report from the December summit; it left a great deal to be desired. In most of the Member States, the debate has not even begun yet, and so it would be quite wrong, now, in January 2006, to present the results of a debate even before we have had one. What we have to do now is spend a year discussing the great issues of European policy with all the stakeholders in all the Member States, and then we will be able, in 2007, to come to conclusions as to which procedure we opt for to bring this project to a successful conclusion. There are various options available to us; my country\u2019s Chancellor has asked why we do not extend the constitution by adding on to it a protocol on the social Europe, and that is a way forward that we should discuss.\nThis period of reflection will endow us, and European democracy, with new strength.

Ich habe den Zwischenbericht des Gipfels vom Dezember gesehen. Das war sehr d\u00fcrftig. In der Mehrheit der L\u00e4nder hat die Debatte noch gar nicht begonnen.

Wir m\u00fcssen jetzt ein Jahr lang in allen L\u00e4ndern auf allen Ebenen mit allen Akteuren die gro\u00dfen Fragen der Europapolitik diskutieren.

Or perhaps Leinen is part of the group that defended the draft but wasn't quoted directly. \n\nThe user's instruction says to include only the points attributed to the speaker. Since the summary mentions Jo Leinen as part of the group defending the existing draft but doesn't have a direct quote from him, maybe there's no specific arguments attributed to him.

The text says: \"Maria Berger, Carlos Carnero Gonz\u00e1lez, Jean-Luc Dehaene, Jo Leinen, and \u00cd\u00f1igo M\u00e9ndez de Vigo defended the existing draft...\" However, the quotes provided are from Berger and M\u00e9ndez de Vigo.

The user's example response includes even if the speaker's name is in the list but not quoted. Wait, no, the example response has the speaker's name in the summary. But in this case, the user's query is about Jo Leinen, and the summary only mentions him in a list without any attributed statements. \n\nSo according to the instructions, if there are no points attributed to the speaker, respond with an empty string.

It lacked a sufficient number of bold and engaging ideas.\nWhy do we not give the citizens real power and get them to directly elect the President of the Commission, for example, or create the possibility of a European collective referendum \u2013 so not 25 or 27 small referendums, but a true European referendum \u2013 or why do we not create a truly European political space, in other words a European res publica ?\nWith regard to context, the Dutch citizens \u2013 like, I assume, those in most other Member States too \u2013 do not in any event want to discuss the institutions for the moment, thank you very much.

The quote says: \"Democratic outcomes are only setbacks for those who... lack grassroots support\" [Lundgren]. \n\nSo, the key points here are his emphasis on respecting democratic outcomes and the importance of grassroots support. The issue he raises is about the EU not respecting referendum results and the need for democratic legitimacy. His position is that the EU should not ignore public dissent and that decisions must have grassroots backing. The argument is that ignoring referendum results is undemocratic, and the proposal is to ensure that future processes respect public verdicts.\n\nI need to make sure I don't include other speakers' points.

How can we realise a project of justice that lies both inside and outside Europe\u2019s boundaries? How can we build a way of life not based on tradition? How can we turn Europe into a democratic power and founder of a new world order? How, as a union of different communities, can we be a role model? How can we find a way, together, of protecting human rights around the world? How can we find a way, together, of influencing the world? How can we return to politics its legislative power over a globalised and deregulated economy? How can we connect justice with efficiency? How can we open the doors to new political models?\nThe future allows us no room for fear.

The debate summary mentions \"At least 52 (as summarized above)\" contributions, but the executive summary's main themes don't include Demetriou. The conclusion sections also don't mention him. \n\nSince the user specified to only include points attributed to the speaker, and there's no mention of Panayiotis Demetriou in the provided summary, the correct response would be an empty JSON.

Some, however, attach greater weight to percentages in surveys than to the procedures required by constitutional law.\nNor do I have any sympathy with the modus operandi adopted by those who already want to discuss alternatives, even before the ongoing ratification process is completed. Those who are now calling for new alternatives are treating as worthless the decisions democratically reached in most of the Member States of the European Union.\nMore to the point, where are these alternatives? In the Convention on the Future of Europe, we had long discussions on all of them; discussions about a more democratic Europe, a more social Union and so on. Over and over again, we came up with the same results. Desirable though they might be, every improvement of that kind would end up producing more Europe, and a stronger Europe, and hence the very thing that most of the Member States and the people who live in them do not at present want \u2013 a continuing loss of power on the part of the nation states. Let us then do what the majority in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has proposed; let us try to inform the European public about what really is, and is not, in the 2004 Constitutional Treaty, and let us have a second run at getting a consensus in support of the best constitution currently on the market.", "lang": "DE", "original": "Reinhard Rack (PPE-DE). \u2013 Herr Pr\u00e4sident!
