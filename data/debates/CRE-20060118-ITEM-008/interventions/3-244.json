{"speaker": "Richard Corbett,", "english": "Richard Corbett, on behalf of the PSE Group . \u2013 Mr President, just one year ago this Parliament endorsed the Constitution by an overwhelming majority. Now there are at least two views within that majority. One view is to say that this text of the Constitution is dead following the referendum defeats in France and the Netherlands; that we had better start thinking of something else and preparing a different way forward. The other view is to say: wait a minute, this text has actually now been ratified by a majority of Member States. The heads of government themselves in the European Council did not declare it dead, they extended the period of ratification and opened a period of reflection. In that period of reflection we must listen to those who said \u2018no\u2019, but we must also listen to the majority who have said \u2018yes\u2019 and find a way forward that can ultimately bring the two together.\nThis report achieves a synthesis of those two viewpoints. It says that it is too soon to conclude now; the period of reflection must be extended at least until 2007. Until then we need to keep all options open. We need longer and deeper reflection. Of course \u2013 as is to be expected \u2013 we say that this Parliament would prefer to maintain the text, but we recognise that that would only be possible if measures were taken to reassure and convince public opinion. What those measures are is left open. There are, in theory, many options: supplementary interpretative declarations, extra protocols, rewriting part of the text, rewriting the whole text, starting a new text. That we will conclude at the end of the period of reflection, but for now let us keep on with that reflection, deepen it, broaden it and reach conclusions in a year\u2019s time.\nOne thing is certain, Mr President: the status quo \u2013 that is, the current Treaties \u2013 is not sufficient for this Union in its enlarged form to function effectively or democratically.
