First, it is nice to start talking about the Constitution again. The budget is out of the way; we can start focusing on other things. To me, it seems as if the Constitution has been in intensive care for the past eight or nine months. Now it has been slowly taken out and I think the process of recovery will be slow, but I think we should be looking at 2009.\nI think the message of this report is that all options are open; easy does it; let us not say that the Constitution is dead; let us not start renegotiating; let us not say that this Treaty cannot enter into force. We have time and we have to think about it.\nThe second point is that recently there has been some controversy between the European Parliament and the speakers of three national parliaments. We need to turn that into a positive. The European Parliament should not, and must not, be arrogant or paternal towards the national parliaments. Yes, let us have a European forum, but let us do it together and have a real debate about the future of the Union.\nMy final point is that from some sections in the past few months we have heard talk about \u2018core Europe\u2019. I think that talk is absolute and utter rubbish, because the people we hear it from are usually the people who want to put the brakes on integration. Let us start by ratifying the Constitution; let us get the ball rolling, let us work together and, most importantly, let us work together within the institutions of the European Union. I cringe at any talk about \u2018core Europe\u2019 outside. The best way forward is to do it inside the Treaty, do it together, and I am sure we can overcome this and have a Constitution by 2009.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Alexander Stubb, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . \u2013 Mr President, I would like to make three points.
