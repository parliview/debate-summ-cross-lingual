{"speaker": "Genowefa Grabowska (PSE). \u2013", "english": "Genowefa Grabowska (PSE). \u2013 (PL) Mr\u00a0President, the resolution we are currently debating is a sound and appropriately balanced compromise document. In addition, it was dealt with in record time. It links in very well with the Austrian Presidency\u2019s priorities presented to us today and also with the Finnish Presidency and the future German Presidency.\nThis means that despite the doubts and reluctance expressed, the Constitution has certainly not been discarded. It is not a thing of the past. On the contrary, it continues to feature prominently on our agendas. As a result of the French and Dutch \u2018no\u2019 votes, the Constitution remains very much alive because we are continuing to debate it. All Europeans need to find an answer to the question as to the kind of Europe they want.\nBy way of this resolution, Parliament is calling on all European citizens to engage in a far-reaching discussion of the question to which I just referred. It is also calling on all national parliaments and governments to state what their expectations are. We should be saying to the governments of the nine Member States which have not yet ratified the Constitution that since their Prime Ministers signed the document, they ought to commence ratification proceedings because it is their right and duty to do so under international law. It is a duty pursuant to the Convention on the Law of Treaties.\nI should like to add one final comment. A country\u2019s approach to the European Constitution is not simply a test of its will to help build a common Europe. It is also a test of that country\u2019s credibility as a partner in international relations.", "lang": "PL", "original": "Genowefa Grabowska (PSE). \u2013 Panie Przewodnicz\u0105cy! Rezolucja, o kt\u00f3rej dyskutujemy jest dokumentem dobrym, dokumentem wywa\u017conym, dokumentem kompromisowym, a do tego podj\u0119tym w znakomitym czasie. Rezolucja wpisuje si\u0119 bowiem doskonale, nie tylko w przedstawione nam dzisiaj priorytety prezydencji austriackiej, ale tak\u017ce prezydencji fi\u0144skiej i przysz\u0142ej prezydencji niemieckiej.\nTo dowodzi, \u017ce wbrew g\u0142osom zw\u0105tpienia, czy niech\u0119ci, konstytucja nie jest wcale wyrzucona na \u015bmietnik, nie jest dokumentem martwym. Wr\u0119cz przeciwnie, konstytucja jest dokumentem \u017cywym. Konstytucja, poprzez francuskie i holenderskie \u201enie\u201d, \u017cyje dlatego, \u017ce wok\u00f3\u0142 niej dyskutujemy.

Ten obowi\u0105zek wynika z konwencji o prawie traktat\u00f3w\u201d.\nI na koniec, ostatnia uwaga. Stosunek pa\u0144stwa do konstytucji europejskiej jest nie tylko testem na ch\u0119\u0107 budowania wsp\u00f3lnej Europy, ale, przede wszystkim, testem pa\u0144stwa na jego wiarygodno\u015b\u0107 jako partnera w stosunkach mi\u0119dzynarodowych.", "agenda_item": "The period of reflection: structure, subjects and context for an assessment of the debate on the EU", "debate_id": "CRE-20060118-ITEM-008", "intervention_id": "3-273", "summary_english": "{\n  \"headline\": \"Constitution Remains Alive Despite Rejections - Calls for Continued Ratification and European-Wide Debate\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"The speaker addresses the status of the EU Constitution following the French and Dutch 'no' votes, emphasizing that the Constitution has not been discarded and remains a central issue requiring European-wide discussion and continued ratification efforts.\",\n  \"positionSum\": \"The speaker strongly supports continuing with the Constitution, viewing it as very much alive and requiring ongoing debate.
