(DE) Mr President, honourable Members, I found it a very interesting experience to take part in this debate and to follow the exchange of opinions. A whole range of them have been expressed, but one thing that has been said does strike me as corresponding to the majority view in the Council, and that is that the European Union, at this present time, before we get a clearer view of the situation, should keep every realistic and reasonable option open, for what we have learned from our experiences over the past year is that quick, perhaps even premature or precipitate estimates of the situation get us nowhere in this debate. I agree with Mr Leinen that the Presidency of the Council, at this stage of debate, would be ill-advised to try to pre-empt results, and would indeed risk doing damage were it to do that.\nWhat we need now is a discussion. Let me reiterate my gratitude to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and to the rapporteurs, Mr Duff and Mr Voggenhuber, for initiating this debate. The Presidency will respond to it. We too believe that all the opinions voiced in this debate have to be respected. As the Vice-President Wallstr\u00f6m so aptly said, \u2018what we want is a Europe for everyone\u2019. Building that Europe is a task that the Austrian Presidency of the Council, too, has set itself. Together with the other Member States and in consultation with the other institutions, we will work on the road map to which reference was made earlier.\nTo the statement made today to the effect that the public are not interested in any debate about institutions, I would counter that this Europe of ours does, however, need the institutions and institutional structures that will enable it to do what its citizens expect of it.\nI very much hope that what the President of the Council has said today will have made it plain that the Austrian Presidency of the Council is very definitely in earnest about addressing the problems that affect the European public and are of interest to them.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Hans Winkler, President-in-Office of the Council .
