Of that there can be no doubt. Two countries have voted against it in referenda and done so with large majorities and high turnouts. The fact that the European political establishment is now trying to explain this away is a democratic scandal. Politicians and senior officials are now openly discussing how the results of these referenda are to be circumvented. They have, of their own accord, the audacity to interpret the results in terms of dissatisfaction with the governments in office in both countries. They are beginning to calculate how many countries were in favour of the draft Constitution, in spite of its being clear that all the countries have to approve the proposal.\nRarely has it been so clear how wide the gulf is between the political elite and the populations on EU issues. Everything indicates that the draft Constitution would have been rejected in Germany, too, if there had been a referendum there. The same applies to the United Kingdom, Austria, Sweden, Denmark and perhaps other countries too. The EU\u2019s power-wielding elite talks shamelessly, however, about difficult setbacks that made their presence felt last year. I wish to point out that democratic outcomes are only setbacks for those who have come off worse because they lack grassroots support.

I och med folkomr\u00f6stningarna i Frankrike och Nederl\u00e4nderna har f\u00f6rfattningsf\u00f6rslaget fallit. Om detta kan inte r\u00e5da n\u00e5gon tvekan. Tv\u00e5 l\u00e4nder har sagt nej i folkomr\u00f6stningar, och det med stora majoriteter och med h\u00f6gt valdeltagande.
