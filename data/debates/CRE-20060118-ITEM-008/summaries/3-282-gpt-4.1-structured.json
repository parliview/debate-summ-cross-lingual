The same people who yesterday denounced the unbelievable denial of parliamentary democracy that led the Commission in Brussels to re-present its directive on port services when it had been rejected, are today prepared to adopt a report which, even more seriously, is a denial of popular democracy.\nThe European Constitution has been rejected by two of the founding members of the European Union, the Netherlands and France. In the opinion of all the independent observers, the people's decision was a well-informed one. They did not just vote according to a context, they voted against the text. Ten Member States have not yet expressed an opinion and several of their leaders do not think they will do so. This is because the Constitution, according to the law and according to the text itself, cannot enter into force, because several of the signatory states have refused to ratify it. It is dead.\nAll this Parliament proposes to do, though, is to consider the best way to serve the same dishes, in the same words, to the citizens, and to brainwash them with propaganda campaigns, with the connivance of the media.
