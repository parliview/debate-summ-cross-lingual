{"speaker": "Genowefa Grabowska (PSE). \u2013", "english": "Genowefa Grabowska (PSE). \u2013 (PL) Mr\u00a0President, the resolution we are currently debating is a sound and appropriately balanced compromise document. In addition, it was dealt with in record time. It links in very well with the Austrian Presidency\u2019s priorities presented to us today and also with the Finnish Presidency and the future German Presidency.\nThis means that despite the doubts and reluctance expressed, the Constitution has certainly not been discarded. It is not a thing of the past. On the contrary, it continues to feature prominently on our agendas. As a result of the French and Dutch \u2018no\u2019 votes, the Constitution remains very much alive because we are continuing to debate it. All Europeans need to find an answer to the question as to the kind of Europe they want.\nBy way of this resolution, Parliament is calling on all European citizens to engage in a far-reaching discussion of the question to which I just referred. It is also calling on all national parliaments and governments to state what their expectations are. We should be saying to the governments of the nine Member States which have not yet ratified the Constitution that since their Prime Ministers signed the document, they ought to commence ratification proceedings because it is their right and duty to do so under international law. It is a duty pursuant to the Convention on the Law of Treaties.\nI should like to add one final comment. A country\u2019s approach to the European Constitution is not simply a test of its will to help build a common Europe. It is also a test of that country\u2019s credibility as a partner in international relations.", "lang": "PL", "original": "Genowefa Grabowska (PSE). \u2013 Panie Przewodnicz\u0105cy!
