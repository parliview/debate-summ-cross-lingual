The institutions and the elite running the European Union have lost the trust of a number of citizens.\nI agree with the opinion of the European Commission, and as I mentioned in my accepted motion for amendment, it is important to ensure that one of the objectives of the period of consideration is to find ways for the European Union to regain the trust of citizens. We also believe that in order to ensure success, we need a debate on how the European Union can increase its performance and how it can contribute to the solution of the real problems of people.\nThe Constitutional Treaty, or its most important sections must be preserved. But we must know that the trust of European Union citizens cannot be regained by complicated texts, but by the performance of the European Union, by jobs, economic growth and the effective representation of common European interests in the world. And if we regain their trust, people will also support the Constitutional Treaty.", "lang": "HU", "original": "J\u00f3zsef Sz\u00e1jer (PPE-DE). \u2013 Tisztelt Eln\u00f6k \u00dar!
