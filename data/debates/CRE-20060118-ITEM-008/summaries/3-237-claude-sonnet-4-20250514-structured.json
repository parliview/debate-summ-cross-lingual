{"speaker": "Paolo Costa (ALDE),", "english": "Paolo Costa (ALDE), draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism. \u2013 (IT) Mr\u00a0President, ladies and gentlemen, as somebody brilliantly put it, for fifty years the European project has been a football match played behind closed doors. With the referendum on the Constitution in France and the Netherlands, the citizens who wanted to get in and watch from the terraces went beyond that and organised an actual invasion of the pitch. Today\u2019s crisis in Europe also lies in the fact that it is no longer possible to go back behind closed doors, back to the Europe of the Treaties and elitist decisions, and that, at the same time, no one knows how to get the people back onto the terraces so that they can express their opinions properly as fans normally do.\nReinventing a system of participation and accountability, whereby the Union answers directly to the citizens, without the self-seeking, distorting and misleading mediation of the Member States, is a prerequisite for setting the European project in motion again, whatever its new content may be. The question is, however, accountability for what? We must avoid the mistake of turning the pause for reflection into a pause of inaction.\nNo Plan D will be a success if, in addition to the \u2018D\u2019 for \u2018debate\u2019, \u2018dialogue\u2019 and \u2018democracy\u2019, it does not also include \u2018D\u2019 for \u2018delivery\u2019. Delivery is the best context in which to recast the text of the Constitution, and the best way to make people understand just how useful Europe can be. That is why even self-inflicted failures, like today\u2019s de facto refusal to regulate market access to port services, can become symbolically dangerous.\nThere are areas of recognised European competence in which the existing treaties already provide for qualified majority voting and the interinstitutional codecision procedure \u2013 transport is one example. There are also areas where subsidiarity should properly be interpreted in reverse: not letting the Member States do badly what can be done better at a European level. In these areas of competence, the Union must raise its delivery rate and dare to show how useful it can be.\nToday it is no longer enough to see the Union merely as a clever solution to the problems of war, including the Cold War. What we need is a Union that is equal to the global challenges of the third millennium. We are also reflecting in order to better understand what we must do tomorrow, but we must be careful not to let that be an excuse for any inaction on our part today, or we would risk invalidating all our reflection, no matter how clever it might be.", "lang": "IT", "original": "Paolo Costa (ALDE), relatore per parere della commissione per i trasporti e il turismo . \u2013 Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, come \u00e8 stato brillantemente detto, la vicenda europea \u00e8 stata per cinquant\u2019anni una partita di calcio giocata a porte chiuse. Con il referendum sulla Costituzione di Francia e Olanda, i cittadini che si volevano ammettere come spettatori sugli spalti sono andati oltre e hanno organizzato delle vere e proprie invasioni di campo. Oggi la crisi europea risiede anche nel fatto che non \u00e8 pi\u00f9 possibile ritornare alle porte chiuse, all\u2019Europa dei trattati e delle decisioni elitarie e che, nel contempo, non si sa come riportare i cittadini sugli spalti a esprimere le loro opinioni attraverso un tifo corretto.\nLa reinvenzione di un circuito di partecipazione e di accountability, ossia di rendicontazione dell\u2019Unione diretta ai cittadini, senza le intermediazioni interessate, falsificanti e fuorvianti degli Stati membri, \u00e8 un presupposto per rimettere in moto il progetto europeo, qualunque siano i suoi nuovi contenuti. Ma rendicontazione di che cosa? L\u2019errore da evitare \u00e8 quello di trasformare la pausa di riflessione in una pausa di inazione.\nNessun \u201cpiano D\u201d avr\u00e0 successo se oltre alle \u201cD\u201d di \u201cdibattito\u201d, \u201cdialogo\u201d e \u201cdemocrazia\u201d non vi sar\u00e0 anche la \u201cD\u201d di \u201c delivery \u201d . Delivery \u00e8 il miglior contesto entro il quale ridefinire il testo della Costituzione, il miglior modo per far capire quanto sia utile l\u2019Europa. Ed \u00e8 per questo che possono diventare simbolicamente pericolosi anche insuccessi auto-inflitti, come la rinuncia di fatto di oggi a regolare l\u2019accesso al mercato dei servizi portuali.\nEsistono aree di riconosciuta competenza europea per le quali i trattati esistenti prevedono gi\u00e0 oggi il voto a maggioranza qualificata e la codecisione interistituzionale \u2013 i trasporti ne sono un esempio \u2013 ed aree per le quali la sussidiariet\u00e0 va correttamente interpretata al contrario: non lasciar fare male agli Stati membri quello che pu\u00f2 essere fatto meglio a livello europeo. Per queste aree di competenza l\u2019Unione deve aumentare il suo tasso di delivery, deve dimostrare il coraggio della sua utilit\u00e0.\nOggi l\u2019Unione europea come soluzione intelligente dei problemi della guerra, anche di quella fredda, non basta pi\u00f9: abbiamo bisogno di un\u2019Unione all\u2019altezza delle sfide globali del Terzo millennio. Riflettiamo pure per capire meglio cosa fare domani, ma occorre fare attenzione affinch\u00e9 ci\u00f2 non sia la causa inaccettabile di una nostra inazione di oggi.
