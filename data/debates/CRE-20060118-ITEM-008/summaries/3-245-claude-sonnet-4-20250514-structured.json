{"speaker": "Bronis\u0142aw Geremek,", "english": "Bronis\u0142aw Geremek, on behalf of the ALDE Group. \u2013 (FR) Mr\u00a0President, the Liberal Democrats in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe warmly welcome the Duff-Voggenhuber report on the period of reflection. We were convinced that the EU needed the constitutional framework. We considered the Constitutional Treaty to be an efficient tool for moving the EU forward and for giving it the political dimension and social perspective that are both necessary. We have not changed our opinion, and we do not think that the Constitution should be declared defunct before we have examined it for signs of life. Otherwise, it will be impossible to declare that the patient is dead.\nNor, however, can the fact be ignored that, during the process of ratification, a disjunction appeared between the desire for deeper integration, demonstrated by the European elites, and the feelings of a section of European society. This disjunction is not only of relevance to the two countries that refused to ratify the draft Constitution. It is a serious problem.\nJean Monnet used to say that, faced with a serious problem, its context sometimes has to be changed. That is precisely the purpose of the period of reflection. The great public debate on the future of the European Union should create a new context for the European constitutional enterprise. It is for the European Parliament to define the framework and the arrangements for these debates, to have the national parliaments and civil society take part in them, to specify the questions and to draw up the necessary agenda. It is in that way that it will be possible for the European forum to appear, and to do so in the form of a public space for Europe. We must not decide just yet on the future of the document. That time will come after the period of reflection, after the European debate and after having changed the context. The report presented to us states this very well.", "lang": "FR", "original": "Bronis\u0142aw Geremek, au nom du groupe ALDE . -Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, les lib\u00e9raux-d\u00e9mocrates de l'ALDE accueillent avec satisfaction le rapport Duff-Voggenhuber sur la p\u00e9riode de r\u00e9flexion. Nous \u00e9tions persuad\u00e9s que l'Union a besoin du cadre constitutionnel. Nous consid\u00e9rions le trait\u00e9 Constitutionnel comme un instrument efficace pour faire avancer l'Union, pour lui donner la dimension politique et l'horizon social qui sont tous deux n\u00e9cessaires. Nous n'avons pas chang\u00e9 d'opinion et nous pensons qu'il ne faut pas d\u00e9clarer la Constitution morte avant de l'ausculter: impossible sans cela de d\u00e9clarer que le patient est mort.\nMais on ne peut pas non plus ignorer qu'au cours du processus de ratification un d\u00e9calage est apparu entre la volont\u00e9 d'int\u00e9gration approfondie, manifest\u00e9e par les \u00e9lites europ\u00e9ennes et la sensibilit\u00e9 d'une partie des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s europ\u00e9ennes.
