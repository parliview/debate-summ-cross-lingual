The European Union originally came about in order to prevent further wars. Nations and peoples tend to join together either around something or against it.\nEurope is now a thing of the past. It has been replaced by the European Union, which still lacks a common vision binding its members together. At present, every one of us can come up with a reason for rejecting the Constitution. Some believe the budget is too small, others that it is too large, whilst others have concerns about Turkey. The new Member States are unhappy about the unfair common agricultural policy and the closed labour market. Nonetheless, we want to stay together.\nWe need to do away with all divisions between us before taking the Constitution to the citizens again and this time we must listen to what the latter have to say and take it into account.", "lang": "PL", "original": "Jan Tadeusz Masiel (NI). \u2013 Panie Przewodnicz\u0105cy!
