Political institutions and social actors, along with the media, will take on the responsibility of addressing the following question: does Europe want to secure the future?\nThe constitution issue is not a simple matter of the architecture of the institutions. It is more about the way in which Europe ensures that its institutions act in accordance with a moral awareness of the world. All of us, citizens of Europe, in the corridors of power, on the Union\u2019s front line, feel the weight of this challenge. How can we govern such a huge and open cosmopolitan area? How can we realise a project of justice that lies both inside and outside Europe\u2019s boundaries? How can we build a way of life not based on tradition? How can we turn Europe into a democratic power and founder of a new world order? How, as a union of different communities, can we be a role model? How can we find a way, together, of protecting human rights around the world? How can we find a way, together, of influencing the world? How can we return to politics its legislative power over a globalised and deregulated economy? How can we connect justice with efficiency? How can we open the doors to new political models?\nThe future allows us no room for fear. We have an urgent need to discuss political integration, to discuss the introduction of a cosmopolitan and more human way of life, to discuss the extent to which the Constitution itself represents and constructs our European identity. After all, our European identity was not born out of tradition, but out of morality, desire and reason.", "lang": "PT", "original": "Maria da Assun\u00e7\u00e3o Esteves (PPE-DE). \u2013 Senhor Presidente, o Parlamento Europeu d\u00e1 hoje o sinal de partida para um grande debate.
