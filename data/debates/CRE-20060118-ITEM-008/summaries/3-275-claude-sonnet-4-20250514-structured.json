To build or rebuild the people\u2019s trust we need vision, effective policies and means, and the means include financial resources and the institutions.\nI believe that we, as Parliament, must not abandon the prospect of the Constitutional Treaty. As for the diatribe about the current text, I think Parliament must defend everything that has been gained through it. Will the debate be able to move on? I do not think it will be easy but, quite frankly, I am not going to rule out that path, either.\nMoreover, as has already been emphasised, I should like us to take that path in close collaboration with the national parliaments, since the way the debate on the subject has been conducted, particularly by European governments, has, in my view, been neither thorough nor correct. I should like to thank the Austrian Presidency for having at last partly resurrected the debate. Let us hope that from now on the various institutions can be more in tune with each other.", "lang": "IT", "original": "Pasqualina Napoletano (PSE). \u2013 Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, il rischio di disfacimento del progetto europeo \u00e8 reale e lo stiamo toccando con mano.

Potr\u00e0 il dibattito spingersi oltre? Credo che non sar\u00e0 facile ma, francamente, non mi precluderei anche questa strada.\nVorrei inoltre, come gi\u00e0 sottolineato, che facessimo un tale percorso in stretta collaborazione con i parlamenti nazionali giacch\u00e9, a mio avviso, il dibattito sulla questione \u00e8 stato condotto in modo non esauriente e scorretto, soprattutto da parte dei governi europei.
