Only a competitive economy can survive in a global market.\nThe EU's internal market, having been one of the strongest participants in the world market, is losing acceleration and is stagnating. By taking advantage of imperfection in WTO rules, and by not adhering to work safety and environmental standards, Asian countries, China for example, are successfully conquering the EU's textiles, footwear and electronics markets.\nThe hesitation of EU states to make decisions, which will influence the long-term outlook for the EU's economic development, also threatens competitiveness in other areas. By this I mean the absence of a common energy and industrial policy, and the growing threat to the EU's labour market and the free movement of services.\nThe application of the transition period for the movement of the new states' labour forces, and the adoption of a services directive, which does not embrace the country of origin principle, will reduce the EU's competitiveness.\nTherefore, I urge the old EU Member States to reject the transition period for the movement of labour forces, and urge the European Parliament to vote for a services directive, which embraces the country of origin principle.", "lang": "LT", "original": "Danut\u0117 Budreikait\u0117, ALDE frakcijos vardu . \u2013 Gerbiamas pirmininke, ponios ir ponai, globali rinka su informacini\u0173 technologij\u0173 paskatintu preki\u0173, paslaug\u0173, darbo ir kapitalo jud\u0117jimu yra rei\u0161kinys, kurio negalime paneigti, o turime siekti pasinaudoti \u0161io rei\u0161kinio teigiamomis galimyb\u0117mis.
