{"speaker": "Zuzana Roithov\u00e1,", "english": "Zuzana Roithov\u00e1, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . \u2013 (CS) This report, which I instigated, is a response to the increasing problems facing the Union\u2019s internal market within the world economy. Given that, in reality, rules around the world differ somewhat from the Union\u2019s internal rules, we stand at a major crossroads. The fate of Europe\u2019s prosperity will depend firstly on how and when we review our social market economy regulations with a view to increasing genuine flexibility, and secondly, on whether Europe is to have a stronger influence on the creation and monitoring of global economic rules that will reflect our values more closely. High social and environmental standards are a laudable outcome of European civilisation, which has declared itself responsible for the long-term sustainable development of the planet. On the other side of that coin, however, are higher production costs and lower competitiveness in a number of sectors that are coming under global pressure, especially from Asian economies unfamiliar with these standards. In third countries, natural resources are plundered, and commerce is characterised by lawlessness. Working and living conditions are at variance with basic human laws. This is something to which Europe must not turn a blind eye.\nThis report is a dialogue on how to review European regulation in such a way that it would not be a hindrance to competitiveness and employment, but would, rather, support the drive to make the European market more attractive and to raise living standards. It is also a call for Europe\u2019s foreign policy to be significantly strengthened and for the assertion of a trade strategy that is based on our values. Our natural ally on this path and at the WTO is the United States, with which I would advocate stepping up dialogue. The weak point regarding this path is the unwieldy decision-making in the Union\u2019s internal institutions, which might have been improved with a new Constitution. Finally, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, who has taken account of the public hearings and the entire debate in both committees. Her report is both well-balanced and thorough, and as such deserves Parliament\u2019s resounding support.", "lang": "CS", "original": "Zuzana Roithov\u00e1, za skupinu PPE-DE . \u2013 Tato zpr\u00e1va, kterou jsem iniciovala, reaguje na r\u016fst probl\u00e9m\u016f, kter\u00fdm dnes \u010del\u00ed vnit\u0159n\u00ed trh unie uvnit\u0159 sv\u011btov\u00e9ho hospod\u00e1\u0159stv\u00ed.
