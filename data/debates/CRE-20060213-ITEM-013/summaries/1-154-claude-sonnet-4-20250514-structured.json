Globalisation can be a challenge, but equally it is an opportunity and that is how we should approach it.\nThe reason is simple. We have no alternative. Seeing globalisation as a threat feeds calls for protectionism. I have stated on numerous occasions that I do not think that closing borders and protecting markets can be the answer. Shielding economies from competition does not make them competitive. Markets only become competitive if companies are forced to compete.\nRemaining in a state of denial, pretending the outside world does not exist, is a recipe for lacklustre economic performance. With poor economic performance, we simply cannot sustain our social model. Globalisation is not something that happens outside the single market; it is part of the single market and the single market is part of a globalised market.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Charlie McCreevy, Member of the Commission .
