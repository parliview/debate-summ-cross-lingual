Since implementing a knowledge-based economy is not feasible without a proper strategy and adequate financing, it will be necessary, before approving the Financial Perspective for 2007\u20132013, to reconsider the incomprehensible reduction in education and research spending, which jeopardises such important activities as the 7th Framework Programme.
