  "english": "Charlie McCreevy, Member of the Commission . Mr President, the European Commission welcomes the own-initiative report of the European Parliament on the effects of globalisation on the internal market and thanks everyone involved, in particular the rapporteurs Mrs Herczog and Mr Markov, as well as the members of the IMCO and INTA Committees, for the good work undertaken in putting this report together. I know that it was not an easy task as the issue of globalisation is an extremely complex one.\nIt was also very useful to organise a hearing on the matter. I appreciated the opportunity to speak about the way I see the challenges, and to hear directly what Members of Parliament and stakeholders had to say. The result is a very balanced and comprehensive report, one which addresses the key challenges in a succinct way. The report is a timely contribution to an important debate. Europe needs to find appropriate responses to today’s key challenges: the steadily increasing forces of global competition, the impact of new technologies and our ageing population.\nAs international integration accelerates, the concept of open markets and a globalising economy have come under attack. Of course, there are legitimate concerns about globalisation. There have to be proper structures, which can help developing and emerging economies in particular. There is also a clear need for appropriate forms of governance. However, there are those who abuse these arguments to try to undermine the whole concept of economic freedom. I am not denying that many industries go through difficult and sometimes painful transitions. But it does no good to try to shift the balance elsewhere – foreign takeovers, cheap imports, and migrant workers.\nProtectionism is not the answer. It never was historically – it only ever led to great tensions between nations – and it is not now. Comparing the degree of openness of economic systems with economic growth and development will show that openness pays. It always has done and it always will. For people first. With jobs. With thriving businesses. By releasing human energies, not capping or constraining them.\nI am very glad that in its report the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, as well as the Committee on International Trade, which has given an opinion, takes a constructive and balanced approach towards globalisation. As the report says, we can make globalisation a success if we provide the right conditions, and if we focus on our strengths. And we do not need to be modest about this. Europe has a lot to offer.\nWe must make sure that Europe and the internal market remain an attractive place for consumers and businesses; an attractive place to invest, particularly for research and innovation activities in high-value products and services, where our businesses excel. This requires a strong, knowledge-based and properly regulated internal market, using the experience we have gained and the lessons we have learned. This is Europe’s best response to its domestic problems of low economic growth and high unemployment, but also to the challenge of globalisation.\nPriorities in this context are: an effective implementation of the new Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs; the completion of the internal market, including for services, telecoms, energy, and financial services; ensuring simple and effective regulation, which frees businesses and citizens from unnecessary costs and red tape; and making better use of the existing internal market framework, which includes better administrative cooperation across borders. Most of the relevant work is already under way, and it is important that all players, at the EU level and at Member State level, do everything to make it happen.\nAs the report quite rightly stresses, globalisation also has a strong external dimension for internal market policy-making. We need to be much more outward-looking than in the past and to be aware of the external aspects of our internal economic policies, such as our internal market rules. Nothing is simply domestic any more. We need more international regulatory convergence and equivalence of rules. This is particularly important in the area of financial markets, which are leading the way in globalisation. Furthermore, Europe must use its scale to help deliver ambitious and balanced solutions to problems of market access or regulatory issues. A successful conclusion of the Doha Round, including on services, is a key element in this respect. Everyone will benefit!\nLast but not least, we need a new partnership of the EU and Member States. Neither can deliver on their own to ensure that Europe remains the attractive place that it still is. I am confident that the report of the European Parliament will contribute significantly to this important wider discussion on Europe in the globalised world.",

    "headline": "Rejection of Protectionism and Call for a Strong, Open Internal Market to Meet Globalisation Challenges",
    "issueSum": "The speaker addresses the complex challenges posed by globalisation to the EU's internal market, noting concerns over global competition, technological change, and demographic issues like an ageing population. He highlights debates around foreign takeovers, cheap imports, and migration, and addresses growing criticism of open markets and economic integration.",
    "positionSum": "The speaker firmly opposes protectionism, asserting that open markets and economic freedom are essential for Europe's prosperity. He supports a balanced, constructive approach to making globalisation work, emphasizing the EU's strengths, the importance of a robust internal market, and the need for more outward-looking policies and regulatory convergence.",
    "argSum": "He argues that historical precedent proves protectionism leads to international tensions and economic stagnation, while openness fosters growth, jobs, and thriving businesses. He asserts that Europe can benefit from globalisation by focusing on innovation, knowledge-based sectors, strong regulation, and leveraging its scale. He also maintains that internal market policies must now consider their external impacts due to the interconnectedness created by globalisation.",
    "propSum": "He proposes: (1) implementing the new Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs, (2) completing the internal market, including key sectors like services and energy, (3) ensuring simple, effective regulation to cut red tape, (4) enhancing administrative cooperation across borders, (5) promoting international regulatory convergence (especially in financial markets), (6) working towards a successful conclusion of the Doha Round, and (7) forging a new EU–Member State partnership to sustain Europe's attractiveness.",

    "headline": "Opposing Protectionism: Strengthening the Internal Market as Europe's Response to Globalisation",
    "issueSum": "The speaker addresses the challenges posed by globalisation to the European internal market, including increased global competition, the impact of new technologies, Europe's ageing population, concerns over foreign takeovers, cheap imports, migrant workers, and fears of economic openness being undermined by protectionist arguments.",
    "positionSum": "The speaker strongly opposes protectionism, arguing that openness and economic integration are in Europe's interest. He supports a balanced and constructive response to globalisation, focusing on strengthening the internal market, fostering innovation and investment, and ensuring effective regulation and international cooperation.",
    "argSum": "The primary argument is that historical and empirical evidence shows openness leads to growth, job creation, and thriving businesses, whereas protectionism creates tensions and stifles economic energy. The speaker further argues that Europe must be outward-looking and ensure its internal market rules are equipped to address global challenges.",
    "propSum": "Specific policy actions proposed include: effective implementation of the Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs; completion of the internal market for sectors such as services, telecoms, energy, and financial services; simplifying regulation and reducing red tape; enhancing administrative cooperation across borders; promoting international regulatory convergence; supporting a successful conclusion to the Doha Round; and establishing a new partnership between the EU and its Member States.",
