Let us think of the expansion of Christianity, the discovery of the world, the scientific and industrial revolution. Europe has always found a progressive answer to any challenges presented by globalisation.\nAt the same time, however, we have always seen that individuals face further and yet further changes with fear and reservation. This was true in every case, even when the change ultimately benefited Europe and the population of Europe. The same is true today. The sudden democratisation of various geographical areas at the beginning of the 21st century and the information and technology revolution have made us realise that the transformation of the world is irreversible, and global competition will remain with us in the long term.\nThe question we are now facing is how Europe should react to the situation to ensure that its citizens come out winners in the 21st century. I am especially delighted that the members of the IMCO Committee think along the same lines. The debate was constructive and thought provoking, and it made it clear that we cannot isolate ourselves. Not only would it be physically impossible to attempt it in today\u2019s world of the Internet and of circumstances changing by the minute, but this would also mean giving up the competition, and would result in falling irrecoverably behind. With reference to the draft resolution tabled before you, I would like to say that as the report was prepared at my own initiative, it is very important to make use of the means available to us, but we cannot exceed the issue of globalisation and internal market, specified in the title. The European political, economic and civil parties must realise that we can only sustain the outstanding social achievements of our continent with economic growth and increasing employment rates. To this end, we must ensure that Europe is the best possible choice for large multinational companies in the global competition. We must ensure that Europe is a certain starting point and a stable background for large European companies, and provides an opportunity for growth and prosperity for small and medium enterprises. There is no doubt that this endeavour places a large responsibility on European legislation, including us, here in the European Parliament. It is obvious that in some over-regulated sectors we need fewer, better and more efficient regulations, but the opposite is true of other areas, where we must be able to rectify any critical deficiencies and create certain legal frameworks. I am specifically thinking of creating and preserving knowledge, and transforming it into an economic advantage.\nThis is a multilayered, horizontal endeavour, which equally involves the support and encouragement of research and innovation, the modernisation of education and the protection of intellectual property. If this is not done, there is no point in referring to a knowledge-based society and economy in the Lisbon Strategy, the Wim Kok report or in any European Parliament decision. And last but not least, allow me to point out that Europe can only be strong and competitive against global challenges if we do not weaken our own unity from within. We need a dynamic internal market and a single European area where citizens cannot only travel freely, but also work freely and utilise their knowledge throughout Europe and for the benefit of Europe.\nThis is what I have tried to contribute to with my report. I would like to express my gratitude for the work of those who have helped. I would like to thank the Commission for the assistance provided, and, let me emphasise again my appreciation of all those who supported this work by proposing amendments and making suggestions.", "lang": "HU", "original": "Edit Herczog (PSE), el\u0151ad\u00f3 . \u2013 A globaliz\u00e1ci\u00f3 Eur\u00f3pa eg\u00e9sz t\u00f6rt\u00e9nelm\u00e9t v\u00e9gigk\u00eds\u00e9rte.

Given that, in reality, rules around the world differ somewhat from the Union\u2019s internal rules, we stand at a major crossroads. The fate of Europe\u2019s prosperity will depend firstly on how and when we review our social market economy regulations with a view to increasing genuine flexibility, and secondly, on whether Europe is to have a stronger influence on the creation and monitoring of global economic rules that will reflect our values more closely. High social and environmental standards are a laudable outcome of European civilisation, which has declared itself responsible for the long-term sustainable development of the planet. On the other side of that coin, however, are higher production costs and lower competitiveness in a number of sectors that are coming under global pressure, especially from Asian economies unfamiliar with these standards. In third countries, natural resources are plundered, and commerce is characterised by lawlessness. Working and living conditions are at variance with basic human laws. This is something to which Europe must not turn a blind eye.\nThis report is a dialogue on how to review European regulation in such a way that it would not be a hindrance to competitiveness and employment, but would, rather, support the drive to make the European market more attractive and to raise living standards. It is also a call for Europe\u2019s foreign policy to be significantly strengthened and for the assertion of a trade strategy that is based on our values. Our natural ally on this path and at the WTO is the United States, with which I would advocate stepping up dialogue. The weak point regarding this path is the unwieldy decision-making in the Union\u2019s internal institutions, which might have been improved with a new Constitution.

In other words, instead of identifying social inequalities and promoting their eradication, it takes refuge in strengthening the players who promote them, in the name of deregulation of the market.\nAs a result, I distinguish three basic negative concepts in the report: firstly, the fact that we are calling on the European Union to define a strategy for facing the challenges in question, by making the internal market more flexible. Secondly, the fact that we are calling on the European Commission to monitor the emergency of signs of protectionism in the Member States and to report regularly to Parliament on any such signs and, thirdly, the idea that there is a need to ensure that the large European market players find sufficient support and opportunities in the internal market to develop into global market players.\nAnyone might reasonably conclude that, with this report, a call is being made for even greater flexibility in employment relations, the abolition of social intervention by the state and support for large companies, at a time when various studies have ascertained that the social consequences of globalisation are extremely negative; in other words, 50 million of the richest Europeans and Americans have the same income as 2.7\u00a0billion people in the rest of the world. Over one billion people on planet Earth do not know how to read and write. The top 20% in the rich countries control 82% of exports and 70% of direct investments. Three billion people in the world have an income of less than two dollars a day, while in the USA the poverty line is calculated to be 11 dollars a day. Therefore, even the official statistics do not give a full picture of economic inequality and poverty.\nFinally, a comparison of the years from 1960 to 1980 with the years 1980 to 2000, when markets internationalised further or globalised, shows that progress clearly slowed down over the last twenty years, when markets opened up and companies traded in conditions of unadulterated competition, when small- and medium-sized enterprises closed down for the benefit of multinationals.

addressing them.

It is regrettable that nothing better seems as yet to have occurred to the Commission than to establish a globalisation fund, thereby transferring more money from the old Member States to the new ones, which were supposed to have used the billions they were given in aid to prepare themselves for accession and can now, on top of the advantage they enjoy through low labour costs, afford a flat tax, while the workers in the old EU Member States feel that the Brussels nomenklatura have left them in the lurch. The fact is that eastward enlargement and headlong globalisation have resulted in such competitive pressure that some workers and some industries can no longer cope with it. The widespread fear of cut-price competition is therefore nothing to be wondered at. We must, then, cost what it may, stick with the transition periods for the labour market in order \u2013 even if only to a limited extent \u2013 to alleviate these evils. There may well be export surpluses, and major conglomerates may be doing well, but jobs that pay social insurance contributions are stagnant, and so our social security system is taking a battering.

Secondly, we have to observe what the World Trade Organisation does about it, and strengthen the UN as the world\u2019s ethics organisation alongside it. Ideas about a \u2018global Marshall Plan\u2019 in development cooperation are highly relevant in this respect.\nMy third point is that the Euro was our greatest contribution to this. Economic and monetary union is a response to globalisation, and that is why the Stability and Growth Pact must be adhered to if we are to carve out the scope for more of the kind.\nFourthly, population change is a headache for us; we need to sort out our social security and pensions systems, and, if we fail do so with a sufficiently lasting effect, we will certainly lose out to globalisation. A few days ago, Jean-Claude Juncker told a gathering of the European People\u2019s Party that \u2018the globalisers\u2019 young people are in Asia, and demographic changes mean that the globalisers\u2019 senior citizens are in the West\u2019. We see this as a disconcerting analysis of our necessary response.\nFifthly, we make the internal market into a domestic market and make the four freedoms a reality for employers and workers. The services directive is part of that.\nLastly, I will point out that education and research and small and medium-sized businesses need the right sort of financial backup if we are to seize the opportunities in our own back yard and not shrink back from the risks involved.", "lang": "DE", "original": "Othmar Karas (PPE-DE). \u2013 Herr Pr\u00e4sident, meine Herren Kommissare, meine Damen und Herren!

Debate Information\n\n**Topic:** Globalisation and the Internal Market  \n**Number of Contributions:** 12 substantive contributions from MEPs and European Commissioner  \n**Date:** Not specified in source material  \n**Participants:** Various MEPs from different political groups (PSE, GUE/NGL, PPE-DE, NI) and Commissioner Charlie McCreevy\n\n## 2. Executive Summary\n\nThe debate revealed a fundamental divide between those embracing globalisation as an opportunity and those viewing it as a threat requiring protective measures. The discussion centered on how Europe should position itself in the global economy while maintaining its social model and competitiveness.\n\n**Pro-Globalisation Positions:**\n\nCommissioner Charlie McCreevy led the pro-globalisation camp, arguing that \"protectionism is not the answer\" and that \"openness pays. It always has done and it always will.\" He emphasized that globalisation and the single market are interconnected, proposing completion of the internal market in services, telecoms, energy, and financial services.\n\nEdit Herczog strongly supported embracing globalisation, stating \"we cannot isolate ourselves\" as this would mean \"falling irrecoverably behind.\" She proposed making Europe attractive to multinational companies while supporting SMEs through better regulation and knowledge-based economy development.\n\nOthmar Karas viewed globalisation as an opportunity, advocating for strengthening international institutions and arguing that \"we have to seize it as an opportunity if we want to take the right action.\" He proposed completing the internal market through the four freedoms and implementing a \"global Marshall Plan.\"\n\n**Market Integration Advocates:**\n\nSeveral speakers focused on internal market completion. Danut\u0117 Budreikait\u0117 argued that \"only a competitive economy can survive in a global market,\" proposing removal of transition periods for labor movement and embracing the country of origin principle in services. Konrad Szyma\u0144ski criticized national protectionism, noting that jobs move \"to Delhi and Beijing rather than to Warsaw or Budapest\" when markets remain closed.\n\nZita Ple\u0161tinsk\u00e1 emphasized competing through \"high added value in its goods and services,\" proposing increased investment in education and R&D while supporting SMEs and opening labor markets.\n\n**Cautious and Critical Positions:**\n\nHelmuth Markov took a more measured approach, supporting trade preferences linked to international labor and environmental standards. He proposed that \"preferential trade arrangements should be extended or adapted\" to favor countries implementing worker protection and environmental standards.\n\nZuzana Roithov\u00e1 highlighted the challenge of maintaining Europe's \"high social and environmental standards\" while competing against economies with lower standards. She proposed strengthening foreign policy and values-based trade strategy while maintaining close cooperation with the United States.\n\n**Strong Opposition:**\n\nKyriacos Triantaphyllides strongly opposed the prevailing approach, arguing it promotes \"market deregulation that increases social inequalities.\" He presented statistics showing that \"50 million of the richest Europeans and Americans have the same income as 2.7 billion people in the rest of the world.\"\n\nAndreas M\u00f6lzer criticized eastward enlargement effects, arguing that competitive pressure means \"some workers and some industries can no longer cope.\" He proposed maintaining labor market transition periods and shifting support from large corporations to SMEs.\n\nGodfrey Bloom dismissed EU intervention entirely, comparing state aid to failing economies to \"giving a bottle of whisky to an alcoholic,\" arguing that \"this place is the problem, it is not the solution.\"\n\n**Key Policy Proposals:**\n\n1. **Internal Market Completion:** Services directive implementation, elimination of transition periods, and full labor mobility\n2. **Innovation Focus:** Increased R&D investment, education funding, and knowledge-based economy development\n3. **SME Support:** Better access to venture capital and reduced regulatory burden\n4. **Standards-Based Trade:** Linking trade preferences to environmental and labor standards compliance\n5. **Regulatory Reform:** Better regulation reducing costs while maintaining high standards\n\nThe debate highlighted the tension between maintaining Europe's social model and competing globally, with most speakers ultimately supporting greater integration and openness while acknowledging legitimate concerns about globalization's social impacts. The Services Directive emerged as a key test case for Europe's commitment to internal market completion in the face of global competition.", "src_model": "claude", "model_type": "claude", "model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "structured": true, "incremental": false, "hierarchical": false, "grouped": false, "shuffle": false, "prompt": false, "lang": "english"}
