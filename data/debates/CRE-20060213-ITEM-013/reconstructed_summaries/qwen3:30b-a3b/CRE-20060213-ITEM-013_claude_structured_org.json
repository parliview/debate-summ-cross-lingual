Let us think of the expansion of Christianity, the discovery of the world, the scientific and industrial revolution. Europe has always found a progressive answer to any challenges presented by globalisation.\nAt the same time, however, we have always seen that individuals face further and yet further changes with fear and reservation. This was true in every case, even when the change ultimately benefited Europe and the population of Europe. The same is true today. The sudden democratisation of various geographical areas at the beginning of the 21st century and the information and technology revolution have made us realise that the transformation of the world is irreversible, and global competition will remain with us in the long term.\nThe question we are now facing is how Europe should react to the situation to ensure that its citizens come out winners in the 21st century. I am especially delighted that the members of the IMCO Committee think along the same lines. The debate was constructive and thought provoking, and it made it clear that we cannot isolate ourselves. Not only would it be physically impossible to attempt it in today\u2019s world of the Internet and of circumstances changing by the minute, but this would also mean giving up the competition, and would result in falling irrecoverably behind. With reference to the draft resolution tabled before you, I would like to say that as the report was prepared at my own initiative, it is very important to make use of the means available to us, but we cannot exceed the issue of globalisation and internal market, specified in the title. The European political, economic and civil parties must realise that we can only sustain the outstanding social achievements of our continent with economic growth and increasing employment rates. To this end, we must ensure that Europe is the best possible choice for large multinational companies in the global competition. We must ensure that Europe is a certain starting point and a stable background for large European companies, and provides an opportunity for growth and prosperity for small and medium enterprises. There is no doubt that this endeavour places a large responsibility on European legislation, including us, here in the European Parliament. It is obvious that in some over-regulated sectors we need fewer, better and more efficient regulations, but the opposite is true of other areas, where we must be able to rectify any critical deficiencies and create certain legal frameworks. I am specifically thinking of creating and preserving knowledge, and transforming it into an economic advantage.\nThis is a multilayered, horizontal endeavour, which equally involves the support and encouragement of research and innovation, the modernisation of education and the protection of intellectual property. If this is not done, there is no point in referring to a knowledge-based society and economy in the Lisbon Strategy, the Wim Kok report or in any European Parliament decision. And last but not least, allow me to point out that Europe can only be strong and competitive against global challenges if we do not weaken our own unity from within. We need a dynamic internal market and a single European area where citizens cannot only travel freely, but also work freely and utilise their knowledge throughout Europe and for the benefit of Europe.\nThis is what I have tried to contribute to with my report. I would like to express my gratitude for the work of those who have helped. I would like to thank the Commission for the assistance provided, and, let me emphasise again my appreciation of all those who supported this work by proposing amendments and making suggestions.", "lang": "HU", "original": "Edit Herczog (PSE), el\u0151ad\u00f3 . \u2013 A globaliz\u00e1ci\u00f3 Eur\u00f3pa eg\u00e9sz t\u00f6rt\u00e9nelm\u00e9t v\u00e9gigk\u00eds\u00e9rte.

I know that it was not an easy task as the issue of globalisation is an extremely complex one.\nIt was also very useful to organise a hearing on the matter. I appreciated the opportunity to speak about the way I see the challenges, and to hear directly what Members of Parliament and stakeholders had to say. The result is a very balanced and comprehensive report, one which addresses the key challenges in a succinct way. The report is a timely contribution to an important debate. Europe needs to find appropriate responses to today\u2019s key challenges: the steadily increasing forces of global competition, the impact of new technologies and our ageing population.\nAs international integration accelerates, the concept of open markets and a globalising economy have come under attack. Of course, there are legitimate concerns about globalisation. There have to be proper structures, which can help developing and emerging economies in particular. There is also a clear need for appropriate forms of governance. However, there are those who abuse these arguments to try to undermine the whole concept of economic freedom. I am not denying that many industries go through difficult and sometimes painful transitions. But it does no good to try to shift the balance elsewhere \u2013 foreign takeovers, cheap imports, and migrant workers.\nProtectionism is not the answer. It never was historically \u2013 it only ever led to great tensions between nations \u2013 and it is not now.

Mr President, the European Commission welcomes the own-initiative report of the European Parliament on the effects of globalisation on the internal market and thanks everyone involved, in particular the rapporteurs Mrs\u00a0Herczog and Mr Markov, as well as the members of the IMCO and INTA Committees, for the good work undertaken in putting this report together. I know that it was not an easy task as the issue of globalisation is an extremely complex one.\nIt was also very useful to organise a hearing on the matter. I appreciated the opportunity to speak about the way I see the challenges, and to hear directly what Members of Parliament and stakeholders had to say. The result is a very balanced and comprehensive report, one which addresses the key challenges in a succinct way. The report is a timely contribution to an important debate. Europe needs to find appropriate responses to today\u2019s key challenges: the steadily increasing forces of global competition, the impact of new technologies and our ageing population.\nAs international integration accelerates, the concept of open markets and a globalising economy have come under attack. Of course, there are legitimate concerns about globalisation. There have to be proper structures, which can help developing and emerging economies in particular. There is also a clear need for appropriate forms of governance. However, there are those who abuse these arguments to try to undermine the whole concept of economic freedom. I am not denying that many industries go through difficult and sometimes painful transitions. But it does no good to try to shift the balance elsewhere \u2013 foreign takeovers, cheap imports, and migrant workers.\nProtectionism is not the answer.

First, I need to check if McCreevy is mentioned in the summary.\n\nLooking through the debate summary, under the \"Positions and Arguments\" section, there's a mention of Commissioner McCreevy. The key quote is: \"protectionism is not the answer\" and \"comparing the degree of openness of economic systems with economic growth and development will show that openness pays.\" \n\nSo, the issue here is about globalization and the EU's response. McCreevy's position is against protectionism, advocating for openness. The argument is that openness leads to economic growth. There's no specific proposal mentioned here, just his stance and reasoning. \n\nI need to structure the response into issueSum, positionSum, argSum, propSum. The user specified not to include other speakers, so only McCreevy's points. Since the example response includes \"Data Act,\" but in this case, the topic is globalization and internal market. \n\nMake sure the JSON is correctly formatted, with each section summarizing the respective parts. Check if there are any other mentions of McCreevy, but from the summary, it seems only that one quote. So the propSum might be empty if there's no proposal, but the example had a propSum. Wait, in the example, even if there's no proposal, maybe leave it as empty? The user said if no points, return empty string. But in this case, McCreevy's contribution is about position and argument, but no specific proposal. So propSum would be empty. \n\nWait, the user's example had \"He advocates strict limitations...\" but in the debate summary, McCreevy's quote is about protectionism and openness. So the propSum would be his proposal, but the summary doesn't mention any specific policy proposal from him, just his position. So propSum would be an empty string. \n\nSo the final JSON would have issueSum about globalization and competitiveness, positionSum about opposing protectionism and supporting openness, argSum about openness leading to growth, and propSum as empty.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The key issue raised by the speaker relates to the EU's approach to globalization and maintaining competitiveness through economic openness.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"He opposed protectionism, arguing that it is not the solution and that openness of economic systems is essential for growth and development.\",\n\"argSum\": \"His argument was based on the assertion that comparing economic openness with growth and development demonstrates that openness yields positive outcomes.\",\n\"propSum\": \"\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Helmuth Markov (GUE/NGL),", "english": "Helmuth Markov (GUE/NGL), draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on International Trade . \u2013 (DE) Mr President, Mrs Herczog, Commissioner, the Committee on International Trade has delivered an opinion that, understandably enough, concerns itself primarily with trade issues, and, although her committee has not taken on board all our suggestions \u2013 for such is politics \u2013 we are grateful to the rapporteur for this own-initiative report of hers.

Given that, in reality, rules around the world differ somewhat from the Union\u2019s internal rules, we stand at a major crossroads. The fate of Europe\u2019s prosperity will depend firstly on how and when we review our social market economy regulations with a view to increasing genuine flexibility, and secondly, on whether Europe is to have a stronger influence on the creation and monitoring of global economic rules that will reflect our values more closely. High social and environmental standards are a laudable outcome of European civilisation, which has declared itself responsible for the long-term sustainable development of the planet. On the other side of that coin, however, are higher production costs and lower competitiveness in a number of sectors that are coming under global pressure, especially from Asian economies unfamiliar with these standards. In third countries, natural resources are plundered, and commerce is characterised by lawlessness. Working and living conditions are at variance with basic human laws. This is something to which Europe must not turn a blind eye.\nThis report is a dialogue on how to review European regulation in such a way that it would not be a hindrance to competitiveness and employment, but would, rather, support the drive to make the European market more attractive and to raise living standards. It is also a call for Europe\u2019s foreign policy to be significantly strengthened and for the assertion of a trade strategy that is based on our values. Our natural ally on this path and at the WTO is the United States, with which I would advocate stepping up dialogue. The weak point regarding this path is the unwieldy decision-making in the Union\u2019s internal institutions, which might have been improved with a new Constitution.

The user mentioned that I should only include points attributed to the specified speaker. The example response shows that the JSON should have four fields: issueSum, positionSum, argSum, propSum. \n\nLooking at the debate summary, under the \"Key Issues Identified\" section, the main challenges are competitiveness against Asia, completing the internal market, and balancing social protection with economic flexibility.

Secondly, the fact that we are calling on the European Commission to monitor the emergency of signs of protectionism in the Member States and to report regularly to Parliament on any such signs and, thirdly, the idea that there is a need to ensure that the large European market players find sufficient support and opportunities in the internal market to develop into global market players.\nAnyone might reasonably conclude that, with this report, a call is being made for even greater flexibility in employment relations, the abolition of social intervention by the state and support for large companies, at a time when various studies have ascertained that the social consequences of globalisation are extremely negative; in other words, 50 million of the richest Europeans and Americans have the same income as 2.7\u00a0billion people in the rest of the world. Over one billion people on planet Earth do not know how to read and write. The top 20% in the rich countries control 82% of exports and 70% of direct investments. Three billion people in the world have an income of less than two dollars a day, while in the USA the poverty line is calculated to be 11 dollars a day. Therefore, even the official statistics do not give a full picture of economic inequality and poverty.\nFinally, a comparison of the years from 1960 to 1980 with the years 1980 to 2000, when markets internationalised further or globalised, shows that progress clearly slowed down over the last twenty years, when markets opened up and companies traded in conditions of unadulterated competition, when small- and medium-sized enterprises closed down for the benefit of multinationals.

It is regrettable that nothing better seems as yet to have occurred to the Commission than to establish a globalisation fund, thereby transferring more money from the old Member States to the new ones, which were supposed to have used the billions they were given in aid to prepare themselves for accession and can now, on top of the advantage they enjoy through low labour costs, afford a flat tax, while the workers in the old EU Member States feel that the Brussels nomenklatura have left them in the lurch. The fact is that eastward enlargement and headlong globalisation have resulted in such competitive pressure that some workers and some industries can no longer cope with it. The widespread fear of cut-price competition is therefore nothing to be wondered at. We must, then, cost what it may, stick with the transition periods for the labour market in order \u2013 even if only to a limited extent \u2013 to alleviate these evils. There may well be export surpluses, and major conglomerates may be doing well, but jobs that pay social insurance contributions are stagnant, and so our social security system is taking a battering. For years, the Commission has been stressing the importance of small and medium-sized businesses as job generators, yet one after another, laws are being enacted that make life more difficult for them. Both support grants and public contracts are targeted at big firms, so these move every couple of years to wherever the highest grants are currently paid.

Ideas about a \u2018global Marshall Plan\u2019 in development cooperation are highly relevant in this respect.\nMy third point is that the Euro was our greatest contribution to this. Economic and monetary union is a response to globalisation, and that is why the Stability and Growth Pact must be adhered to if we are to carve out the scope for more of the kind.\nFourthly, population change is a headache for us; we need to sort out our social security and pensions systems, and, if we fail do so with a sufficiently lasting effect, we will certainly lose out to globalisation. A few days ago, Jean-Claude Juncker told a gathering of the European People\u2019s Party that \u2018the globalisers\u2019 young people are in Asia, and demographic changes mean that the globalisers\u2019 senior citizens are in the West\u2019.

McCreevy's main argument is against protectionism, so the issue is the challenge of maintaining competitiveness through openness. \n\n\"positionSum\" should state his position. He supports openness and opposes protectionism. The example mentions \"supports the Data Act's objectives but emphasizes concerns,\" but in this case, his position is in favor of openness and against protectionism.\n\n\"argSum\" would be the reasoning behind his position.
