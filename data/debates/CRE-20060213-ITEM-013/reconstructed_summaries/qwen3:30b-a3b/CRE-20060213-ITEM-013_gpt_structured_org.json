The user provided a debate summary about globalization and the internal market, and they want me to outline the main points of a specific speaker, which in this case is the \"President.\" But wait, looking at the debate summary, the speakers listed are names like Edit Herczog, Charlie McCreevy, Helmuth Markov, etc. There's no mention of a \"President\" in the speaker-by-speaker analysis. The user might have made a typo or mistake. \n\nWait, the user's instruction says the speaker name is \"President.\" But in the provided debate summary, there's no entry for a President. The speakers listed are from different political groups, like PSE, Lib, GUE/NGL, etc. Maybe the user intended a different name, but they wrote \"President\" by accident. However, I need to follow the instructions strictly.\n\nThe task is to extract the main points of the specified speaker. If there's no information about the \"President\" in the debate summary, then the correct response would be an empty JSON. But I need to check again. Let me scan through the entire debate summary again.\n\nLooking through the \"Speaker-by-Speaker Analysis,\" there's a section for each speaker, but none are labeled as \"President.\" The last speaker listed is Othmar Karas. The user might have intended a different name, but according to the given data, there's no \"President\" contribution. Therefore, the answer should be an empty string as per the instructions. But the user's example response shows a JSON with empty strings. Wait, the user says if there are no points, respond with an empty string. But the JSON structure requires the keys. Wait, the user's example shows that even if there's no info, the JSON should have empty strings. Wait, the user's example response has:\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"...\",\n\"positionSum\": \"...\",\n\"argSum\": \"...\",\n\"propSum\": \"...\"\n}\n\nBut if there's no info, the user says to respond with an empty string. Wait, the user says: \"If this is the case, respond with an empty string.\" But the example shows a JSON. Wait, the user's instruction says: \"You must respond in json format. Outputs must be parseable by json.loads().\"\n\nBut if there are no points, the user says to respond with an empty string. However, an empty string is not a JSON object. This is conflicting. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe user says: \"If this is the case, respond with an empty string.\"\n\nBut the example response is a JSON. So maybe the user wants the JSON with empty strings for each field if there's no information. But the user's instruction says \"respond with an empty string.\" Hmm. This is a bit confusing. However, given the example, maybe the user expects the JSON structure even if all fields are empty. But the user's instruction says \"respond with an empty string\" if there are no points. So perhaps the correct answer here is an empty string, but the JSON structure is required. But that's impossible. Therefore, maybe the user made a mistake, but according to the given data, there's no \"President\" speaker. Therefore, the answer is an empty JSON. But the user's example shows that even if there's no info, the JSON is filled with empty strings. Wait, the user's example shows that the response is a JSON with the four fields, each being a string. So if there's no info, each field is an empty string. So the correct answer would be:\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"\",\n\"positionSum\": \"\",\n\"argSum\": \"\",\n\"propSum\": \"\"\n}\n\nBut the user says \"if there are no points, respond with an empty string.\" But the example shows a JSON. So maybe the user wants the JSON with empty strings. Therefore, even if there's no information, the JSON is returned with empty strings. So in this case, since there's no \"President\" speaker, the answer is the JSON with all empty strings.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"\",\n\"positionSum\": \"\",\n\"argSum\": \"\",\n\"propSum\": \"\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "gpt-4.1", "generator_model_type": "gpt", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "gpt"}, {"speaker": "Edit Herczog (PSE),", "english": "Edit Herczog (PSE), rapporteur. \u2013 (HU) Globalisation has been present throughout the history of Europe. Let us think of the expansion of Christianity, the discovery of the world, the scientific and industrial revolution. Europe has always found a progressive answer to any challenges presented by globalisation.\nAt the same time, however, we have always seen that individuals face further and yet further changes with fear and reservation. This was true in every case, even when the change ultimately benefited Europe and the population of Europe. The same is true today. The sudden democratisation of various geographical areas at the beginning of the 21st century and the information and technology revolution have made us realise that the transformation of the world is irreversible, and global competition will remain with us in the long term.\nThe question we are now facing is how Europe should react to the situation to ensure that its citizens come out winners in the 21st century. I am especially delighted that the members of the IMCO Committee think along the same lines. The debate was constructive and thought provoking, and it made it clear that we cannot isolate ourselves. Not only would it be physically impossible to attempt it in today\u2019s world of the Internet and of circumstances changing by the minute, but this would also mean giving up the competition, and would result in falling irrecoverably behind. With reference to the draft resolution tabled before you, I would like to say that as the report was prepared at my own initiative, it is very important to make use of the means available to us, but we cannot exceed the issue of globalisation and internal market, specified in the title. The European political, economic and civil parties must realise that we can only sustain the outstanding social achievements of our continent with economic growth and increasing employment rates. To this end, we must ensure that Europe is the best possible choice for large multinational companies in the global competition. We must ensure that Europe is a certain starting point and a stable background for large European companies, and provides an opportunity for growth and prosperity for small and medium enterprises. There is no doubt that this endeavour places a large responsibility on European legislation, including us, here in the European Parliament. It is obvious that in some over-regulated sectors we need fewer, better and more efficient regulations, but the opposite is true of other areas, where we must be able to rectify any critical deficiencies and create certain legal frameworks. I am specifically thinking of creating and preserving knowledge, and transforming it into an economic advantage.\nThis is a multilayered, horizontal endeavour, which equally involves the support and encouragement of research and innovation, the modernisation of education and the protection of intellectual property. If this is not done, there is no point in referring to a knowledge-based society and economy in the Lisbon Strategy, the Wim Kok report or in any European Parliament decision. And last but not least, allow me to point out that Europe can only be strong and competitive against global challenges if we do not weaken our own unity from within. We need a dynamic internal market and a single European area where citizens cannot only travel freely, but also work freely and utilise their knowledge throughout Europe and for the benefit of Europe.\nThis is what I have tried to contribute to with my report. I would like to express my gratitude for the work of those who have helped. I would like to thank the Commission for the assistance provided, and, let me emphasise again my appreciation of all those who supported this work by proposing amendments and making suggestions.", "lang": "HU", "original": "Edit Herczog (PSE), el\u0151ad\u00f3 . \u2013 A globaliz\u00e1ci\u00f3 Eur\u00f3pa eg\u00e9sz t\u00f6rt\u00e9nelm\u00e9t v\u00e9gigk\u00eds\u00e9rte.

Key arguments include that historical evidence shows openness pays, and the internal market needs to adapt to global realities. His proposals are implementing the Lisbon Strategy, completing the internal market in key sectors, simplifying regulation, promoting international regulatory convergence, concluding the Doha Round, and fostering a new EU-Member States partnership.\n\nThe second entry repeats his position, reiterating that globalization is an opportunity and rejecting protectionism. His arguments are that globalization and market openness are inherently beneficial, and closing off harms competitiveness. Proposals are to embrace globalization and reject protectionist responses.\n\nNow, the user wants the main points from the speaker. The task is to outline the main points or arguments made by Charlie McCreevy. The user also mentioned that contributions from others shouldn't be included, only the speaker's own points.\n\nSo, for \"issueSum\", the key issues would be about globalization, internal market, protectionism, and the need for openness. \n\n\"positionSum\" should summarize his stance: opposing protectionism, advocating for openness, competition, and strengthening the internal market.\n\n\"argSum\" would include the arguments like historical evidence showing openness is beneficial, and that closing off markets harms competitiveness.\n\n\"propSum\" would list his proposals such as implementing Lisbon Strategy, completing the internal market, simplifying regulations, etc.\n\nI need to make sure not to include any points from other speakers.

Given that, in reality, rules around the world differ somewhat from the Union\u2019s internal rules, we stand at a major crossroads. The fate of Europe\u2019s prosperity will depend firstly on how and when we review our social market economy regulations with a view to increasing genuine flexibility, and secondly, on whether Europe is to have a stronger influence on the creation and monitoring of global economic rules that will reflect our values more closely. High social and environmental standards are a laudable outcome of European civilisation, which has declared itself responsible for the long-term sustainable development of the planet. On the other side of that coin, however, are higher production costs and lower competitiveness in a number of sectors that are coming under global pressure, especially from Asian economies unfamiliar with these standards. In third countries, natural resources are plundered, and commerce is characterised by lawlessness. Working and living conditions are at variance with basic human laws. This is something to which Europe must not turn a blind eye.\nThis report is a dialogue on how to review European regulation in such a way that it would not be a hindrance to competitiveness and employment, but would, rather, support the drive to make the European market more attractive and to raise living standards. It is also a call for Europe\u2019s foreign policy to be significantly strengthened and for the assertion of a trade strategy that is based on our values. Our natural ally on this path and at the WTO is the United States, with which I would advocate stepping up dialogue. The weak point regarding this path is the unwieldy decision-making in the Union\u2019s internal institutions, which might have been improved with a new Constitution.

The issueSum should mention the key issues she raised, which are competitiveness, labor mobility, and internal market reforms. The positionSum should state her stance on these issues. The argSum would be the reasoning behind her arguments, like inaction leading to reduced competitiveness. The propSum lists her proposals.\n\nI need to make sure I don't include anything from other speakers. Let me double-check the details to ensure accuracy. Yes, her main points are about labor mobility, internal market reforms, and opposing transitional periods. The quotes she's associated with are about competitiveness and the need for the country of origin principle.\n\nSo, compiling that into the JSON structure without any extra information. Make sure the keys are correct and the values are concise summaries. No markdown, just plain JSON. Let me verify once more to avoid any mistakes.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The key issues raised by the speaker include the need for stronger competitiveness, labor mobility, and internal market reforms within the EU.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"The speaker advocates for abolishing transitional periods for labor mobility and supports the country of origin principle in the Services Directive to enhance competitiveness.\",\n\"argSum\": \"The speaker argues that inaction reduces EU competitiveness and that open labor markets and the country of origin principle are essential for addressing challenges posed by globalization.\",\n\"propSum\": \"Proposes abolishing transitional periods for labor mobility and supporting the country of origin principle in the Services Directive to strengthen the internal market.\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "gpt-4.1", "generator_model_type": "gpt", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "gpt"}, {"speaker": "Kyriacos Triantaphyllides,", "english": "Kyriacos Triantaphyllides, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group . \u2013 (EL) Mr President, the report on the effects of globalisation on the internal market is based on an erroneous perception which has been generally promoted for some time now by the European Commission and which is leading to the rejection of the Constitutional Treaty. In other words, instead of identifying social inequalities and promoting their eradication, it takes refuge in strengthening the players who promote them, in the name of deregulation of the market.\nAs a result, I distinguish three basic negative concepts in the report: firstly, the fact that we are calling on the European Union to define a strategy for facing the challenges in question, by making the internal market more flexible. Secondly, the fact that we are calling on the European Commission to monitor the emergency of signs of protectionism in the Member States and to report regularly to Parliament on any such signs and, thirdly, the idea that there is a need to ensure that the large European market players find sufficient support and opportunities in the internal market to develop into global market players.\nAnyone might reasonably conclude that, with this report, a call is being made for even greater flexibility in employment relations, the abolition of social intervention by the state and support for large companies, at a time when various studies have ascertained that the social consequences of globalisation are extremely negative; in other words, 50 million of the richest Europeans and Americans have the same income as 2.7\u00a0billion people in the rest of the world. Over one billion people on planet Earth do not know how to read and write. The top 20% in the rich countries control 82% of exports and 70% of direct investments. Three billion people in the world have an income of less than two dollars a day, while in the USA the poverty line is calculated to be 11 dollars a day. Therefore, even the official statistics do not give a full picture of economic inequality and poverty.\nFinally, a comparison of the years from 1960 to 1980 with the years 1980 to 2000, when markets internationalised further or globalised, shows that progress clearly slowed down over the last twenty years, when markets opened up and companies traded in conditions of unadulterated competition, when small- and medium-sized enterprises closed down for the benefit of multinationals.

It is regrettable that nothing better seems as yet to have occurred to the Commission than to establish a globalisation fund, thereby transferring more money from the old Member States to the new ones, which were supposed to have used the billions they were given in aid to prepare themselves for accession and can now, on top of the advantage they enjoy through low labour costs, afford a flat tax, while the workers in the old EU Member States feel that the Brussels nomenklatura have left them in the lurch. The fact is that eastward enlargement and headlong globalisation have resulted in such competitive pressure that some workers and some industries can no longer cope with it. The widespread fear of cut-price competition is therefore nothing to be wondered at. We must, then, cost what it may, stick with the transition periods for the labour market in order \u2013 even if only to a limited extent \u2013 to alleviate these evils. There may well be export surpluses, and major conglomerates may be doing well, but jobs that pay social insurance contributions are stagnant, and so our social security system is taking a battering. For years, the Commission has been stressing the importance of small and medium-sized businesses as job generators, yet one after another, laws are being enacted that make life more difficult for them. Both support grants and public contracts are targeted at big firms, so these move every couple of years to wherever the highest grants are currently paid.

Secondly, we have to observe what the World Trade Organisation does about it, and strengthen the UN as the world\u2019s ethics organisation alongside it. Ideas about a \u2018global Marshall Plan\u2019 in development cooperation are highly relevant in this respect.\nMy third point is that the Euro was our greatest contribution to this. Economic and monetary union is a response to globalisation, and that is why the Stability and Growth Pact must be adhered to if we are to carve out the scope for more of the kind.\nFourthly, population change is a headache for us; we need to sort out our social security and pensions systems, and, if we fail do so with a sufficiently lasting effect, we will certainly lose out to globalisation. A few days ago, Jean-Claude Juncker told a gathering of the European People\u2019s Party that \u2018the globalisers\u2019 young people are in Asia, and demographic changes mean that the globalisers\u2019 senior citizens are in the West\u2019.

The relevant section says: \"Position: Sees globalisation as an opportunity; suggests that internal reforms and investment in social systems are essential.
