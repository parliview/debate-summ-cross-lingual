The user provided a detailed debate summary about globalization and the internal market, and they want me to extract the main points from the President's speech. But wait, the speaker name given is \"President.\" \u2013 maybe that's a placeholder or a mistake?\n\nFirst, I need to check the debate summary. The executive summary lists 10 speakers with their positions, but there's no mention of a President. The user might have intended a different name, but according to the input, the speaker is \"President.\" \n\nLooking through the debate summary, the speakers are Edit Herczog, Charlie McCreevy, Helmuth Markov, Danut\u0117 Budreikait\u0117, Kyriacos Triantaphyllides, Godfrey Bloom, Konrad Szyma\u0144ski, Andreas M\u00f6lzer, Othmar Karas, and Zita Ple\u0161tinsk\u00e1. No President is listed. So maybe the user made an error, but I have to follow the instructions.\n\nThe task is to outline the main points of the specified speaker. If there's no information about the President's contributions, the response should be an empty string. The example given in the instructions shows that if there are no points, the JSON should have empty strings.\n\nTherefore, since the President isn't mentioned in the debate summary provided, the correct response is an empty JSON with all fields as empty strings.

Let us think of the expansion of Christianity, the discovery of the world, the scientific and industrial revolution. Europe has always found a progressive answer to any challenges presented by globalisation.\nAt the same time, however, we have always seen that individuals face further and yet further changes with fear and reservation. This was true in every case, even when the change ultimately benefited Europe and the population of Europe. The same is true today. The sudden democratisation of various geographical areas at the beginning of the 21st century and the information and technology revolution have made us realise that the transformation of the world is irreversible, and global competition will remain with us in the long term.\nThe question we are now facing is how Europe should react to the situation to ensure that its citizens come out winners in the 21st century. I am especially delighted that the members of the IMCO Committee think along the same lines. The debate was constructive and thought provoking, and it made it clear that we cannot isolate ourselves. Not only would it be physically impossible to attempt it in today\u2019s world of the Internet and of circumstances changing by the minute, but this would also mean giving up the competition, and would result in falling irrecoverably behind. With reference to the draft resolution tabled before you, I would like to say that as the report was prepared at my own initiative, it is very important to make use of the means available to us, but we cannot exceed the issue of globalisation and internal market, specified in the title. The European political, economic and civil parties must realise that we can only sustain the outstanding social achievements of our continent with economic growth and increasing employment rates. To this end, we must ensure that Europe is the best possible choice for large multinational companies in the global competition. We must ensure that Europe is a certain starting point and a stable background for large European companies, and provides an opportunity for growth and prosperity for small and medium enterprises. There is no doubt that this endeavour places a large responsibility on European legislation, including us, here in the European Parliament. It is obvious that in some over-regulated sectors we need fewer, better and more efficient regulations, but the opposite is true of other areas, where we must be able to rectify any critical deficiencies and create certain legal frameworks. I am specifically thinking of creating and preserving knowledge, and transforming it into an economic advantage.\nThis is a multilayered, horizontal endeavour, which equally involves the support and encouragement of research and innovation, the modernisation of education and the protection of intellectual property. If this is not done, there is no point in referring to a knowledge-based society and economy in the Lisbon Strategy, the Wim Kok report or in any European Parliament decision. And last but not least, allow me to point out that Europe can only be strong and competitive against global challenges if we do not weaken our own unity from within. We need a dynamic internal market and a single European area where citizens cannot only travel freely, but also work freely and utilise their knowledge throughout Europe and for the benefit of Europe.\nThis is what I have tried to contribute to with my report. I would like to express my gratitude for the work of those who have helped. I would like to thank the Commission for the assistance provided, and, let me emphasise again my appreciation of all those who supported this work by proposing amendments and making suggestions.", "lang": "HU", "original": "Edit Herczog (PSE), el\u0151ad\u00f3 . \u2013 A globaliz\u00e1ci\u00f3 Eur\u00f3pa eg\u00e9sz t\u00f6rt\u00e9nelm\u00e9t v\u00e9gigk\u00eds\u00e9rte.

Mr President, the European Commission welcomes the own-initiative report of the European Parliament on the effects of globalisation on the internal market and thanks everyone involved, in particular the rapporteurs Mrs\u00a0Herczog and Mr Markov, as well as the members of the IMCO and INTA Committees, for the good work undertaken in putting this report together. I know that it was not an easy task as the issue of globalisation is an extremely complex one.\nIt was also very useful to organise a hearing on the matter. I appreciated the opportunity to speak about the way I see the challenges, and to hear directly what Members of Parliament and stakeholders had to say. The result is a very balanced and comprehensive report, one which addresses the key challenges in a succinct way. The report is a timely contribution to an important debate. Europe needs to find appropriate responses to today\u2019s key challenges: the steadily increasing forces of global competition, the impact of new technologies and our ageing population.\nAs international integration accelerates, the concept of open markets and a globalising economy have come under attack. Of course, there are legitimate concerns about globalisation. There have to be proper structures, which can help developing and emerging economies in particular. There is also a clear need for appropriate forms of governance. However, there are those who abuse these arguments to try to undermine the whole concept of economic freedom. I am not denying that many industries go through difficult and sometimes painful transitions. But it does no good to try to shift the balance elsewhere \u2013 foreign takeovers, cheap imports, and migrant workers.\nProtectionism is not the answer. It never was historically \u2013 it only ever led to great tensions between nations \u2013 and it is not now. Comparing the degree of openness of economic systems with economic growth and development will show that openness pays. It always has done and it always will. For people first. With jobs. With thriving businesses. By releasing human energies, not capping or constraining them.\nI am very glad that in its report the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, as well as the Committee on International Trade, which has given an opinion, takes a constructive and balanced approach towards globalisation. As the report says, we can make globalisation a success if we provide the right conditions, and if we focus on our strengths. And we do not need to be modest about this. Europe has a lot to offer.\nWe must make sure that Europe and the internal market remain an attractive place for consumers and businesses; an attractive place to invest, particularly for research and innovation activities in high-value products and services, where our businesses excel. This requires a strong, knowledge-based and properly regulated internal market, using the experience we have gained and the lessons we have learned. This is Europe\u2019s best response to its domestic problems of low economic growth and high unemployment, but also to the challenge of globalisation.\nPriorities in this context are: an effective implementation of the new Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs; the completion of the internal market, including for services, telecoms, energy, and financial services; ensuring simple and effective regulation, which frees businesses and citizens from unnecessary costs and red tape; and making better use of the existing internal market framework, which includes better administrative cooperation across borders.

I am confident that the report of the European Parliament will contribute significantly to this important wider discussion on Europe in the globalised world.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Charlie McCreevy, Member of the Commission . Mr President, the European Commission welcomes the own-initiative report of the European Parliament on the effects of globalisation on the internal market and thanks everyone involved, in particular the rapporteurs Mrs\u00a0Herczog and Mr Markov, as well as the members of the IMCO and INTA Committees, for the good work undertaken in putting this report together. I know that it was not an easy task as the issue of globalisation is an extremely complex one.\nIt was also very useful to organise a hearing on the matter. I appreciated the opportunity to speak about the way I see the challenges, and to hear directly what Members of Parliament and stakeholders had to say. The result is a very balanced and comprehensive report, one which addresses the key challenges in a succinct way. The report is a timely contribution to an important debate. Europe needs to find appropriate responses to today\u2019s key challenges: the steadily increasing forces of global competition, the impact of new technologies and our ageing population.\nAs international integration accelerates, the concept of open markets and a globalising economy have come under attack. Of course, there are legitimate concerns about globalisation. There have to be proper structures, which can help developing and emerging economies in particular. There is also a clear need for appropriate forms of governance. However, there are those who abuse these arguments to try to undermine the whole concept of economic freedom. I am not denying that many industries go through difficult and sometimes painful transitions. But it does no good to try to shift the balance elsewhere \u2013 foreign takeovers, cheap imports, and migrant workers.\nProtectionism is not the answer. It never was historically \u2013 it only ever led to great tensions between nations \u2013 and it is not now. Comparing the degree of openness of economic systems with economic growth and development will show that openness pays. It always has done and it always will. For people first. With jobs. With thriving businesses. By releasing human energies, not capping or constraining them.\nI am very glad that in its report the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, as well as the Committee on International Trade, which has given an opinion, takes a constructive and balanced approach towards globalisation. As the report says, we can make globalisation a success if we provide the right conditions, and if we focus on our strengths. And we do not need to be modest about this. Europe has a lot to offer.\nWe must make sure that Europe and the internal market remain an attractive place for consumers and businesses; an attractive place to invest, particularly for research and innovation activities in high-value products and services, where our businesses excel. This requires a strong, knowledge-based and properly regulated internal market, using the experience we have gained and the lessons we have learned. This is Europe\u2019s best response to its domestic problems of low economic growth and high unemployment, but also to the challenge of globalisation.\nPriorities in this context are: an effective implementation of the new Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs; the completion of the internal market, including for services, telecoms, energy, and financial services; ensuring simple and effective regulation, which frees businesses and citizens from unnecessary costs and red tape; and making better use of the existing internal market framework, which includes better administrative cooperation across borders. Most of the relevant work is already under way, and it is important that all players, at the EU level and at Member State level, do everything to make it happen.\nAs the report quite rightly stresses, globalisation also has a strong external dimension for internal market policy-making. We need to be much more outward-looking than in the past and to be aware of the external aspects of our internal economic policies, such as our internal market rules.

The task is to extract the main points he made, without including others.\n\nFirst, I need to find where Charlie McCreevy is mentioned in the debate summary. Looking through the speaker positions, there's an entry for him. The summary says he \"strongly rejects protectionism\" and believes Europe should embrace openness and competition. He mentions that protectionism isn't the answer, citing historical and current reasons.

The keys are issueSum, positionSum, argSum, propSum. \n\nFor issueSum, the key issue here is about balancing openness vs. protectionism. McCreevy's position is against protectionism, so positionSum should reflect that. The arguments he uses are historical and current evidence that protectionism doesn't work. His proposals include internal market completion, regulation simplification, cross-border cooperation, regulatory convergence, and WTO support.\n\nI need to make sure I don't include any other speakers' points. The user specified that only McCreevy's contributions should be included. Let me check the original debate summary again to confirm.

He demands a \"properly endowed\" Globalisation Adjustment Fund to compensate those affected.

He also advocates for impact assessments before trade negotiations.\n\nThe arguments he uses are likely based on the need to protect vulnerable groups and ensure that trade policies don't undermine labor and environmental standards. The summary doesn't explicitly state his reasoning, but his positions imply that without proper safeguards, globalization could harm workers and the environment.\n\nFor \"propSum,\" his proposals include the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, linking trade preferences to standards, and conducting impact assessments.\n\nI need to make sure I don't include any information from other speakers.

Given that, in reality, rules around the world differ somewhat from the Union\u2019s internal rules, we stand at a major crossroads. The fate of Europe\u2019s prosperity will depend firstly on how and when we review our social market economy regulations with a view to increasing genuine flexibility, and secondly, on whether Europe is to have a stronger influence on the creation and monitoring of global economic rules that will reflect our values more closely. High social and environmental standards are a laudable outcome of European civilisation, which has declared itself responsible for the long-term sustainable development of the planet. On the other side of that coin, however, are higher production costs and lower competitiveness in a number of sectors that are coming under global pressure, especially from Asian economies unfamiliar with these standards. In third countries, natural resources are plundered, and commerce is characterised by lawlessness. Working and living conditions are at variance with basic human laws. This is something to which Europe must not turn a blind eye.\nThis report is a dialogue on how to review European regulation in such a way that it would not be a hindrance to competitiveness and employment, but would, rather, support the drive to make the European market more attractive and to raise living standards. It is also a call for Europe\u2019s foreign policy to be significantly strengthened and for the assertion of a trade strategy that is based on our values. Our natural ally on this path and at the WTO is the United States, with which I would advocate stepping up dialogue. The weak point regarding this path is the unwieldy decision-making in the Union\u2019s internal institutions, which might have been improved with a new Constitution.

In other words, instead of identifying social inequalities and promoting their eradication, it takes refuge in strengthening the players who promote them, in the name of deregulation of the market.\nAs a result, I distinguish three basic negative concepts in the report: firstly, the fact that we are calling on the European Union to define a strategy for facing the challenges in question, by making the internal market more flexible. Secondly, the fact that we are calling on the European Commission to monitor the emergency of signs of protectionism in the Member States and to report regularly to Parliament on any such signs and, thirdly, the idea that there is a need to ensure that the large European market players find sufficient support and opportunities in the internal market to develop into global market players.\nAnyone might reasonably conclude that, with this report, a call is being made for even greater flexibility in employment relations, the abolition of social intervention by the state and support for large companies, at a time when various studies have ascertained that the social consequences of globalisation are extremely negative; in other words, 50 million of the richest Europeans and Americans have the same income as 2.7\u00a0billion people in the rest of the world. Over one billion people on planet Earth do not know how to read and write. The top 20% in the rich countries control 82% of exports and 70% of direct investments. Three billion people in the world have an income of less than two dollars a day, while in the USA the poverty line is calculated to be 11 dollars a day. Therefore, even the official statistics do not give a full picture of economic inequality and poverty.\nFinally, a comparison of the years from 1960 to 1980 with the years 1980 to 2000, when markets internationalised further or globalised, shows that progress clearly slowed down over the last twenty years, when markets opened up and companies traded in conditions of unadulterated competition, when small- and medium-sized enterprises closed down for the benefit of multinationals.

The user provided a debate summary about globalization and the internal market, and they want me to focus on Kyriacos Triantaphyllides' contributions.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the debate summary to find all mentions of Kyriacos Triantaphyllides. From the speaker positions section, point 5 mentions him. He criticized the Commission\u2019s report for prioritizing flexibility and deregulation over social concerns. He argues that the report \"takes refuge in strengthening the players who promote [inequalities], in the name of deregulation of the market.\" His main points are about unchecked inequality and lack of proposals to address negative social impacts.\n\nNow, the user wants the response in JSON format with specific fields: issueSum, positionSum, argSum, propSum. I need to make sure each field is a summary of his arguments without including others.\n\nIssueSum should capture the key issue he raised. He's concerned about social impacts and inequality due to deregulation. \n\nPositionSum needs to outline his position. He's against the Commission's approach, emphasizing social concerns over deregulation. \n\nArgSum is the reasoning behind his position. His argument is that the report doesn't address inequality and fails to tackle negative social effects.\n\nPropSum should mention any proposals. The summary says he called attention to unchecked inequality and lack of proposals, but doesn't mention specific policies from him. So maybe propSum is empty or states he didn't offer proposals but highlighted the need.\n\nWait, the example response includes propSum even if there's no proposal.

It is regrettable that nothing better seems as yet to have occurred to the Commission than to establish a globalisation fund, thereby transferring more money from the old Member States to the new ones, which were supposed to have used the billions they were given in aid to prepare themselves for accession and can now, on top of the advantage they enjoy through low labour costs, afford a flat tax, while the workers in the old EU Member States feel that the Brussels nomenklatura have left them in the lurch. The fact is that eastward enlargement and headlong globalisation have resulted in such competitive pressure that some workers and some industries can no longer cope with it. The widespread fear of cut-price competition is therefore nothing to be wondered at.

Let me check:\n\nYes, under \"Speaker Positions, Arguments, and Proposals\", point 9 is Andreas M\u00f6lzer. The summary says: \"Andreas M\u00f6lzer is critical of rapid globalisation and EU enlargement, claiming these create 'competitive pressure that some workers and some industries can no longer cope with' [M\u00f6lzer, Debate Date]. He favors maintaining transitional labour periods and immediate reforms to grant allocation to better support SMEs over large companies.\"\n\nSo the key points here are his criticism of rapid globalization and EU enlargement, the competitive pressure on workers and industries, his support for maintaining transitional labor periods, and reforms to allocate grants more favorably to SMEs instead of large companies.\n\nNow, I need to structure this into the four JSON fields: issueSum, positionSum, argSum, propSum.\n\nIssueSum should be the key issue he raised. The main issue here is the negative effects of rapid globalization and EU enlargement on workers and industries.\n\nPositionSum is his position. He's critical of rapid globalization and EU enlargement, and he favors maintaining transitional labor periods and reforms to support SMEs.\n\nArgSum would be the reasoning behind his position. The argument is that these measures (transitional periods and SME support) are needed because of the competitive pressure.\n\nPropSum is his proposals: maintaining transitional labor periods and immediate reforms for grant allocation to SMEs.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't include any other speakers' points. The user specified that only the points attributed to Andreas M\u00f6lzer should be included. Also, the example response uses concise summaries. Let me check if there's any other info about him in the debate summary. The executive summary's comparative analysis mentions him in the social protection/adjustment focus, but the user wants only his own points. The key is to stick strictly to what's attributed to him in the speaker positions section.\n\nSo, compiling all that into the JSON structure. Make sure the sentences are clear and concise, using the exact terms from the summary. For example, \"maintaining transitional labour periods\" and \"immediate reforms to grant allocation to better support SMEs over large companies.\"\n\nI think that's all. Now, structure it into the JSON format as specified.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"Andreas M\u00f6lzer raised concerns about the negative impacts of rapid globalisation and EU enlargement on workers and industries, particularly the competitive pressure they face.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"He is critical of rapid globalisation and EU enlargement, advocating for the maintenance of transitional labour periods and reforms to prioritise support for SMEs over large companies.\",\n\"argSum\": \"His position is based on the argument that current levels of globalisation and EU expansion create unsustainable competitive pressures for certain workers and industries.\",\n\"propSum\": \"He proposed maintaining transitional labour periods and implementing immediate reforms to allocate grants more favourably to SMEs rather than large corporations.\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "gpt-4.1", "generator_model_type": "gpt", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "gpt"}, {"speaker": "Othmar Karas (PPE-DE). \u2013", "english": "Othmar Karas (PPE-DE). \u2013 (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have six ideas that I would like to put forward on this subject.\nIn the first place, although we are all aware that globalisation is going on, I do believe, in contrast to Mr\u00a0M\u00f6lzer, who spoke just now, that we have to seize it as an opportunity if we want to take the right action. Secondly, we have to observe what the World Trade Organisation does about it, and strengthen the UN as the world\u2019s ethics organisation alongside it. Ideas about a \u2018global Marshall Plan\u2019 in development cooperation are highly relevant in this respect.\nMy third point is that the Euro was our greatest contribution to this. Economic and monetary union is a response to globalisation, and that is why the Stability and Growth Pact must be adhered to if we are to carve out the scope for more of the kind.\nFourthly, population change is a headache for us; we need to sort out our social security and pensions systems, and, if we fail do so with a sufficiently lasting effect, we will certainly lose out to globalisation. A few days ago, Jean-Claude Juncker told a gathering of the European People\u2019s Party that \u2018the globalisers\u2019 young people are in Asia, and demographic changes mean that the globalisers\u2019 senior citizens are in the West\u2019. We see this as a disconcerting analysis of our necessary response.\nFifthly, we make the internal market into a domestic market and make the four freedoms a reality for employers and workers. The services directive is part of that.\nLastly, I will point out that education and research and small and medium-sized businesses need the right sort of financial backup if we are to seize the opportunities in our own back yard and not shrink back from the risks involved.", "lang": "DE", "original": "Othmar Karas (PPE-DE). \u2013 Herr Pr\u00e4sident, meine Herren Kommissare, meine Damen und Herren!

The user provided a debate summary about globalization and the internal market, and they want me to focus on Charlie McCreevy's contributions. The task is to extract the main points, positions, arguments, and proposals from his speech, excluding others.\n\nFirst, I need to locate the section on Charlie McCreevy in the debate summary. Looking at the \"Speaker Positions, Arguments, and Proposals\" part, point 2 is about him. The summary says he strongly rejects protectionism and believes Europe should embrace openness and competition. His quotes mention that protectionism isn't the answer and that he calls for completing the internal market, simplifying regulation, enhancing cross-border cooperation, global regulatory convergence (especially in financial markets), and supporting WTO negotiations.\n\nNow, I need to structure this into the JSON format as specified. The issueSum should capture the key issue he's addressing. Since he's talking about globalization and the internal market, the issue is how to handle globalization through openness and competition. \n\nPositionSum needs to outline his stance. He's against protectionism and in favor of openness, competition, and specific reforms. \n\nArguments would be why he holds this position. The summary mentions he believes protectionism isn't viable historically and now, so his argument is that openness leads to benefits.\n\nProposals are the actions he suggests: completing the internal market, simplifying regulation, cross-border cooperation, regulatory convergence, and supporting WTO negotiations.\n\nI need to make sure not to include any other speakers' points. Check if there's anything else about McCreevy. The summary also says he \"calls for completing the internal market, simplifying regulation, enhancing cross-border cooperation, furthering global regulatory convergence (notably in financial markets), and supporting WTO negotiations.\" So those are his proposals.\n\nPutting it all together into the JSON structure. Ensure each field is a summary without markdown. Check for accuracy and that only his points are included.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The key issue raised by the speaker relates to the need for Europe to embrace openness and competition in the context of globalization, rather than adopting protectionist measures.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"He strongly rejects protectionism, arguing that Europe must prioritize openness, competition, and market integration to benefit from globalization.\",\n\"argSum\": \"His position is based on the belief that protectionism has historically failed and is ineffective in addressing the challenges of globalization, emphasizing that competition and openness are essential for economic prosperity.\",\n\"propSum\": \"He proposes completing the internal market, simplifying regulation, enhancing cross-border cooperation, advancing global regulatory convergence (particularly in financial markets), and supporting WTO negotiations.\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "gpt-4.1", "generator_model_type": "gpt", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "gpt"}, {"speaker": "President. \u2013", "english": "President. \u2013 The debate is closed.\nThe vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon.", "lang": "EN", "original": "President. \u2013 The debate is closed.\nThe vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon.", "agenda_item": "Globalisation and the internal market (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060213-ITEM-013", "intervention_id": "1-155", "summary_english": "{\n\"headline\": \"\",\n\"issueSum\": \"\",\n\"positionSum\": \"\",\n\"argSum\": \"\",\n\"propSum\": \"\",\n\"quotes\": []\n}", "summary_original": "{\n\"headline\": \"\",\n\"issueSum\": \"\",\n\"positionSum\": \"\",\n\"argSum\": \"\",\n\"propSum\": \"\",\n\"quotes\": []\n}", "model": "gpt-4.1", "method": "structured", "formatted_summary": {"headline": "", "issueSum": "", "positionSum": "", "argSum": "", "propSum": "", "quotes": []}, "reconstructed_position": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query.

Scanning through the speaker positions, the list includes names like Edit Herczog, Charlie McCreevy, Helmuth Markov, etc., but the President isn't mentioned in any of the contributions. The \"President. \u2013\" line seems to be a placeholder or a formatting error, possibly indicating that the President did not make a speech or that the contribution isn't detailed here.\n\nSince the user's instruction says to only include points attributed to the specified speaker and return an empty string if none, I need to confirm there's no information on the President's arguments.
