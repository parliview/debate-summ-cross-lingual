I agree with the rapporteur that if the phenomenon of globalisation is to be positively perceived, it must benefit as many stakeholders as possible, including small and medium-sized enterprises.\nWhat should the European Union do to stand up to the competition of the USA and vast, rapidly growing, Asian economies?\nFirstly, investment in education, research and development must be a priority, because the only way for the European Union to compete is through high added value in its goods and services. Since implementing a knowledge-based economy is not feasible without a proper strategy and adequate financing, it will be necessary, before approving the Financial Perspective for 2007\u20132013, to reconsider the incomprehensible reduction in education and research spending, which jeopardises such important activities as the 7th Framework Programme. A warning to this effect has also been issued by the European Universities Association, a\u00a0prominent European academic body that brings together universities and the national organisations for heads of universities.\nSecondly, we must focus our support on small and medium-sized start-up businesses, and improve their access to venture capital in the early phases of their development, as they form the backbone of the entire economic system.\nThirdly, twelve Member States of the European Union must embrace the\u00a0message from the European Commission that closing labour markets does not pay.\nFourthly, we must eliminate barriers in the internal market by approving the amendment to the Services Directive proposed by IMCO.
