We have still not curbed the Union\u2019s appetite for legislation. I am therefore delighted that the Commission is now proposing to us this balanced diet: three conditions to ensure that this agenda functions, strengthens the Union and brings it closer to Europeans. It has been said that Europe should make laws only when it can do better than other levels of authority. As we have just heard Mr\u00a0Stubb say, from the Canaries to Scandinavia, by way of Brussels, we must avoid once and for all using European jargon, and we must speak and write laws in the language that is most easily understood by all those for whom it is intended. There are many more examples.\nThirdly, this slimming diet that we want and that the SMEs, in particular, also want is not a casual, non-interventionist diet. It must be stressed - and here I shall conclude, Madam President - that better regulation does not mean lack of ambition. I agree with Mrs Frassoni: it is REACH, for example, that I am thinking of in highlighting this last point.", "lang": "FR", "original": "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Ries (ALDE). - Madame la Pr\u00e9sidente, je rejoins parfaitement ici ceux qui estiment qu\u2019un r\u00e9gime minceur ferait du bien \u00e0 l\u2019Europe de la r\u00e9glementation, une Europe tatillonne sur les principes et malheureusement plus permissive sur le suivi de la transposition et de la bonne application de nos l\u00e9gislations.\nUn constat: dix ans apr\u00e8s le lancement du programme Slim, et malgr\u00e9 la signature, il y a deux ans, de l\u2019accord interinstitutionnel \u00abMieux l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer\u00bb, on est aujourd\u2019hui encore loin du compte.
