{"speaker": "Jonas Sj\u00f6stedt (GUE/NGL). \u2013", "english": "Jonas Sj\u00f6stedt (GUE/NGL). \u2013 (SV) Madam President, I do not think that this debate can be reduced to a debate on the quality of legislation. The actual quantity of EU legislation must also be debated. The fact is that the number of EU laws has risen dramatically in recent years, and the EU is now legislating in a host of new areas. At the same time, it is extremely unusual for the EU to give its right of decision-making back to Member States or to repeal legislation. The combination of a very large quantity of legislation and the deficient quality of such legislation makes for a lack of clarity and makes it difficult to implement legislation in practice.\nWhere quality is concerned, there is a lot that can now already be done, and the reports contain proposals for doing these things. Out-of-date legislation can be repealed. Other legislation can be simplified, and some can be merged and consolidated. All that is fine, but another way of approaching legislative work is also required. In determining the direction to be taken by legislation, we need to focus more on objectives and less on detail, and we need to give the Member States greater freedom to choose how they are to pursue the objectives set.\nImpact analyses are fine, but it is not always so easy to measure what we want to measure. More often than not, it is simpler to measure straightforward economic factors than, for example, environmental factors. We had this debate in connection with the debate on the chemicals policy, REACH. It was easy to measure a company\u2019s costs, but difficult to measure the huge benefits in terms of public health and reduced human suffering of there being fewer diseases. This means that there is a need to be rather careful in this area.\nIf there is a real desire to simplify matters, the number of EU laws must be reduced, and the area that is absolutely the most overregulated is agricultural policy, where most matters could be returned to Member State level and thousands of laws could be abolished. A number of speakers refer to the European Constitution. The fact is, it would have made these problems worse by increasing the EU\u2019s power and making it easier for the EU to appropriate new legislative powers and to be able to legislate in areas in which it really ought not to get involved. We should therefore thank the Dutch and French voters now as well.", "lang": "SV", "original": "Jonas Sj\u00f6stedt (GUE/NGL). \u2013 Fru talman! Jag menar att denna diskussion inte kan reduceras till en diskussion om kvaliteten p\u00e5 lagstiftningen. Man m\u00e5ste ocks\u00e5 diskutera kvantiteten, m\u00e4ngden EU-lagstiftning. Faktum \u00e4r att m\u00e4ngden EU-lagar har v\u00e4xt dramatiskt p\u00e5 senare \u00e5r, och EU lagstiftar idag p\u00e5 en hel rad nya omr\u00e5den. Samtidigt \u00e4r det extremt ovanligt att EU \u00e5terger beslutander\u00e4tt till medlemsl\u00e4nder eller upph\u00e4ver lagstiftning. Kombinationen mycket stor m\u00e4ngd lagstiftning och bristande kvalitet ger d\u00e5lig \u00f6versk\u00e5dlighet och g\u00f6r det sv\u00e5rt att genomf\u00f6ra lagstiftningen i praktiken.\nN\u00e4r det g\u00e4ller kvaliteten s\u00e5 kan mycket g\u00f6ras redan idag, och det finns f\u00f6rslag p\u00e5 det i bet\u00e4nkandena. F\u00f6r\u00e5ldrad lagstiftning kan tas bort, den kan f\u00f6renklas och man kan sl\u00e5 samman och konsolidera lagstiftningen. Allt det \u00e4r gott och v\u00e4l, men det kr\u00e4vs ocks\u00e5 ett annat s\u00e4tt att n\u00e4rma sig lagstiftningsarbetet. Vi beh\u00f6ver mindre detaljstyrning, mer m\u00e5lstyrning och st\u00f6rre frihet f\u00f6r medlemsl\u00e4nderna att v\u00e4lja hur man genomf\u00f6r de m\u00e5l som man sl\u00e5r fast.\nN\u00e4r det g\u00e4ller konsekvensanalyser s\u00e5 \u00e4r de bra, men det \u00e4r inte alltid s\u00e5 l\u00e4tt att m\u00e4ta det man vill m\u00e4ta. Oftast \u00e4r det enklare att m\u00e4ta enkla ekonomiska faktorer \u00e4n exempelvis milj\u00f6faktorer. Vi hade den diskussionen i samband med debatten om Reach, kemikaliepolitiken. Det var l\u00e4tt att m\u00e4ta f\u00f6retagets kostnader men sv\u00e5rt att m\u00e4ta de enorma positiva effekterna f\u00f6r folkh\u00e4lsan eller sett till m\u00e4nskligt lidande, d\u00e5 man f\u00e5r f\u00e4rre sjukdomar. Det g\u00f6r att man skall vara lite f\u00f6rsiktig p\u00e5 detta omr\u00e5de.\nVill man verkligen g\u00f6ra en f\u00f6renkling s\u00e5 m\u00e5ste man minska antalet EU-lagar, och det omr\u00e5de som \u00e4r absolut mest \u00f6verreglerat \u00e4r jordbrukspolitiken. H\u00e4r skulle det mesta kunna \u00e5terf\u00f6ras till medlemsstatsniv\u00e5 och tusentals lagar skulle kunna f\u00f6rsvinna. En del talar om EU konstitutionen, faktum \u00e4r att den hade gjort dessa problem v\u00e4rre genom att \u00f6ka EU:s makt, g\u00f6ra det l\u00e4ttare f\u00f6r EU att tillskansa sig nya lagstiftningsbefogenheter och kunna lagstifta p\u00e5 omr\u00e5den som man egentligen inte f\u00e5r g\u00e5 in p\u00e5.
