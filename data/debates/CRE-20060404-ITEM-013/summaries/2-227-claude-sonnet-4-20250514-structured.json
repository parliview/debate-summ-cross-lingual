The European Parliament\u2019s work must be transparent and clearly formulated, and we must, in particular, remove the administrative barriers in European legislation. I therefore call on Parliament's leadership to ensure that our legislative work is better coordinated so that we do not again end up in a situation in which the committees propose amendments that contradict each other. At the same time, we must prioritise legal certainty and predictability for our citizens and not let the authorities or the European Court of Justice have too much discretion.\nThe President of the European Council - the Austrian Chancellor \u2013 has attacked the European Court of Justice for arrogating too much power to itself. However, the Court is merely doing its job, because we legislators are not doing our own sufficiently well.\nI am, unfortunately, afraid that, with the Services Directive, we are in the process of repeating previous errors and that we are letting the European Court of Justice have too much scope for interpretation. This is an area in which we must all do better at second reading.", "lang": "DA", "original": "Karin Riis-J\u00f8rgensen (ALDE). - Fru formand Europa-Parlamentet skal v\u00e6re bannerf\u00f8rer for bedre lovgivning.
