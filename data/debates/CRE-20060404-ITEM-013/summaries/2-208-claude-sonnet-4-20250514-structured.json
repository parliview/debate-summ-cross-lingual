{"speaker": "Malcolm Harbour,", "english": "Malcolm Harbour, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . \u2013 Madam President, I particularly want to welcome all the reports. As coordinator of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I particularly would like to commend Mrs\u00a0McCarthy on the excellent work she has done, as well as our committee, which held a hearing on this topic.\nOne of the lessons we must learn from this exercise \u2013 and I say this to the select group of colleagues around here \u2013 is that better regulation is a shared task for every single Member of this Parliament, whatever committee they belong to. It is good that we are broadening out the discussion, but too few people are engaged.\nThe major point I wish to make tonight, linked to the amendments I made to Mrs\u00a0McCarthy\u2019s report, which were accepted by the committee, is that better regulation is a process. I agree with much of what Mrs\u00a0Wallis says. The problem is that the process is difficult, complex and very few people understand it. We have to try to explain and simplify it, but we need to explain it to our own constituencies as well as to people outside. How many people in this Parliament can really say that they understand the procedures that have now been set up within the Commission to improve the quality of legislation? How many of you know what your responsibilities are under the famous interinstitutional agreement, which was signed in this very Chamber two years ago by our then President, Pat Cox? I suspect that if we had a questionnaire about it, most of you would have no idea what those obligations are.\nSurely the first thing, colleagues, is that we should be putting our own House in order; that each of us should have that simplified checklist. We should say, when the Commission sends us a proposal \u2013 and this again is a recommendation \u2013 that with each proposal there should be just a short checklist about the procedures that the Commission has already gone through and the ones that it will go through in future. If there are documents and impact assessments, they should be clearly attached to that.\nThat is the sort of practical definition and clarification of the process that we need. If we do not do that, citizens outside will lose belief in the process. The better legislation process is vital for the future of the whole way we do business here.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Malcolm Harbour, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . \u2013 Madam President, I particularly want to welcome all the reports.
