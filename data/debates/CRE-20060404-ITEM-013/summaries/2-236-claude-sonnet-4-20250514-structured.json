{"speaker": "Edit Herczog (PSE). \u2013", "english": "Edit Herczog (PSE). \u2013 (HU) The rapporteur did an excellent job in identifying the obstacles in Community and Member State laws that create difficulties in the operation of the internal market. The solution is the review of the existing laws and a better, more cautious preparation of new laws. This is the responsibility of the legislation process itself. Neither the Commission, who prepares and executes the laws, nor the legislating Council and Parliament are passing on this responsibility to others, and particularly not to external bodies.\nParliament has a role and responsibility in the review of existing laws in its capacity of legislator. I respectfully ask the Commission to cooperate closely with Parliament, in the spirit of the Interinstitutional Agreement on better law-making.\nWhen preparing future regulations, it is not expedient to further complicate the long, bureaucratic procedures. If we were to create an independent external audit body today to examine the quality of impact assessment studies, why should we not create an independent external inspection body tomorrow, to examine the independence of the audit body? Rather than multiplying the bodies inspecting procedures that have proved to be wrong, we should develop new, more efficient working methods to improve the regulation of the internal market. Together with the review of the laws, the Commission, Council and Parliament must also reconsider their own procedures, and if required, they must transform them responsibly.\nFinally, I would like to call the attention of all three institutions to the fact that society will only trust and respect European law if we ensure full publicity and social control.", "lang": "HU", "original": "Edit Herczog (PSE). \u2013 A jelent\u00e9stev\u0151 kiv\u00e1l\u00f3an azonos\u00edtotta a k\u00f6z\u00f6ss\u00e9gi, illetve tag\u00e1llami jogszab\u00e1lyokban rejl\u0151 akad\u00e1lyokat, melyek nehez\u00edtik a bels\u0151 piac m\u0171k\u00f6d\u00e9s\u00e9t.
