{"speaker": "Manuel Medina Ortega (PSE). \u2013", "english": "Manuel Medina Ortega (PSE). \u2013 (ES) Madam President, there was a time when laws were made by gods; gods made perfect laws. Then the gods became tired and men began to make laws, and laws are now imperfect. At the moment, therefore, whether a law is good or bad is decided by nobody but ourselves, the only criterion for judging whether a law is good or bad is democracy, the criterion of the majority, because, as Rousseau said, \u2018it is reasonable for the majority to decide, rather than the minority'.\nHaving established this principle in the modern democracies, democracy is representative and it is the parliaments that legislate; they can make mistakes, but the only criterion for legitimacy is the parliamentary majority. On this basis, I believe that the greatest danger to democracy at the moment is the technocracy associated with economic interests \u2014 what is known as self-regulation or co-regulation \u2014 which is a way to put general interests into the hands of the individual interests of the few, and that is something we should remember.\nI myself, having been elected to many terms in office, would not be prepared to renounce my legislative responsibilities in favour of sub-contracting and in favour of technocratic interests.", "lang": "ES", "original": "Manuel Medina Ortega (PSE). \u2013 (ES) Se\u00f1or Presidente, hubo una \u00e9poca en la que las leyes las hac\u00edan los dioses; los dioses hac\u00edan leyes perfectas.

Entonces, en el momento actual, si una ley es buena o mala no lo decide nadie, sino nosotros mismos, y el \u00fanico criterio para saber si una ley es buena o mala es la democracia, el criterio de la mayor\u00eda, porque, como dec\u00eda Rousseau, \u00abes razonable que sea la mayor\u00eda la que decida, y no la minor\u00eda\u00bb.\nEstablecido este principio en las democracias modernas, la democracia es representativa y son los Parlamentos los que legislan; pueden equivocarse, pero el \u00fanico criterio de legitimidad es la mayor\u00eda parlamentaria.
