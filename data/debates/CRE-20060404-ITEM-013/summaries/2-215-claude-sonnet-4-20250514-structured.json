{"speaker": "Marek Aleksander Czarnecki (NI). \u2013", "english": "Marek Aleksander Czarnecki (NI). \u2013 (PL) Madam\u00a0President, the European Commission monitors application of Community law on a yearly basis. At present we are debating the Commission\u2019s 21st and 22nd annual reports. In order to appreciate the scale of the problem, it should be pointed out that some four thousand infringement proceedings are involved. A so-called reasoned opinion has been issued for almost one thousand of these, and over 400 have been referred to the Court of Justice.\nIt is a matter of regret that the Commission was late in submitting the 22nd\u00a0annual report. This was only received in January\u00a02006 and consequently Parliament was only able to refer to part of the Commission\u2019s information for 2004 in its resolution. Paradoxically, it could be said that the more complaints, the better. This is because the complaints indicate that citizens of the Member States are playing an important role in the monitoring process and thus also in Union lawmaking. The citizens\u2019 complaints are not symbolic in nature. They are part of the process of building a citizens\u2019 Europe and in general they are an effective way of monitoring the application of Community law.\nThe European Parliament\u2019s committees should monitor the implementation of Community law closely, particularly in situations where the relevant rapporteur is required to participate actively in monitoring the application of a particular legal provision in individual Member States and also, naturally, when it comes to calling for immediate action should any infringements be noted.\nThe efficiency of the process should be improved by abbreviating the internal procedure, as was rightly included in the draft European Parliament resolution. It would also be appropriate to authorise individual Commissioners to exercise direct control over the transposition of Community provisions into national law within the stated periods of time. This could be achieved by authorising Commissioners to address requests for dealing with infringements within their particular sphere of competence directly to Member States.", "lang": "PL", "original": "Marek Aleksander Czarnecki (NI). \u2013 Pani Przewodnicz\u0105ca!
