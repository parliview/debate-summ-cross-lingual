{"speaker": "Zuzana Roithov\u00e1 (PPE-DE). \u2013", "english": "Zuzana Roithov\u00e1 (PPE-DE). \u2013 (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I realise that the new approach to European regulation requires changes in thinking, and possibly even changes to agreements. If we wish, however, to retain the public\u2019s faith in the single market, we must stem the outflow of investment and the loss of jobs. This means that we must not only reduce and simplify legislation, but we must also, in my opinion, reconsider the original aims of both European and national regulation. This is a serious political challenge. It is also up to us, ladies and gentlemen, to demand that every single measure, whether aimed at, for example, protecting health or the environment, is subjected to an impact assessment. Mrs\u00a0McCarthy is requesting this in the report of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection . I would add that it must be made clear what costs will be borne by European producers, by how much public finances will be increased or depleted and what will be the effect on unemployment in our regions. In particular we should know in advance how regulations aimed at improving standards will affect the competitiveness of European products vis-\u00e0-vis third countries, so as to ensure that the main outcome is not the further migration of plant and capital away from Europe.\nBetter regulation also means that, in the context of costs, we will investigate seriously whether the new measures might really improve the health or social conditions of our citizens, or whether this is merely an unfounded assumption. Both as a doctor and as a politician I do not like it that so many European and national regulations are merely populist gestures. Against that, I have no clear ideas on how to protect consumers against the harmful or counterfeit products from third countries that are displacing quality European products. An example of this might be the children\u2019s footwear from Asia that has orthopaedic defects. The only solution to this would be a mandatory new health certificate for children\u2019s footwear, which would also be better regulation for the public.\nI am sorry that the Commission is being so slow to codify consumer protection and the protection of intellectual property. Never before has the standard of European regulation been as important as it is today, when the Union faces serious competition from third countries. The political aim of today\u2019s regulation is to safeguard both fair competition and the European consumer \u2013 not only inside but also outside Europe \u2013 and also to motivate the creativity of our citizens while ridding them of ineffective regulation.", "lang": "CS", "original": "Zuzana Roithov\u00e1 (PPE-DE). \u2013 D\u00e1my a p\u00e1nov\u00e9, jsem si v\u011bdoma, \u017ee nov\u00fd p\u0159\u00edstup k evropsk\u00e9 regulaci vy\u017eaduje zm\u011bnu my\u0161len\u00ed, mo\u017en\u00e1 i smluv.
