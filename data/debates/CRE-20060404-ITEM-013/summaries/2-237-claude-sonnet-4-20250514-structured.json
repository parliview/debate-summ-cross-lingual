In this simplification project, as for any new measure adopted, the principles of proportionality and of subsidiarity must be respected: the European Union where it is necessary, when it is more effective than the Member States acting independently, as much as is needed, but no more than is needed.\nThe application of these apparently technical principles involves making a judgment as to their social, cultural or other appropriateness, even though there is no effective mechanism with which to monitor their application. This loophole was filled by the draft Constitution. While we are waiting for it to be ratified, we have to wonder about the proper application of these principles.\nOn the other hand, we need to improve the monitoring of the transposition of Community law because lack of legal certainty undermines the competitiveness of our businesses. The introduction of national correspondents is a positive measure if the controls encompass a quantitative and a qualitative analysis and include an impact analysis regarding the social, economic and ecological environment. These impact analyses must be comparable: they must therefore be standardised. In order to achieve this aim, the European Parliament must strengthen its power in this area.", "lang": "FR", "original": "V\u00e9ronique Mathieu (PPE-DE). - La l\u00e9gislation europ\u00e9enne est trop complexe et parfois superflue: une r\u00e9novation intelligente doit permettre de lutter contre cette opacit\u00e9 malsaine et dommageable!\nD\u2019une part, il convient d\u2019am\u00e9liorer en r\u00e9duisant et simplifiant la l\u00e9gislation existante.
