{"speaker": "Bruno Gollnisch (NI). \u2013", "english": "Bruno Gollnisch (NI). \u2013 (FR) Madam President, you are an eminent specialist on the ancient Japan of the Tokugawa era, during which people were deliberately kept in ignorance of laws deemed to be state secrets, knowledge of which was restricted to a small number of great lords, because it was thought that in this way people would retain far greater respect for standards about which they knew nothing. Well, I sometimes wonder whether we do not, in fact, draw our inspiration from this ancient Japanese legislation.\nIn reality, ladies and gentlemen, I think that the complexity of European law is the perverse effect of a group dynamic to which we are all party. What is it all about? Firstly, the initiative rests with the Commission, but behind every Commissioner, there is, of course, the general management and the officials who are part of it. Next, it passes to the Council. In theory, the Council is composed of ministers. They reach agreement on a text, provided that each of their respective bureaucracies recognises in it all of the standards that are to feature in the joint text, then the text is passed to Parliament and Parliament appoints a rapporteur. Naturally, the rapporteur, as is perfectly legitimate, wants his name to go down in history. His name is much more likely to be remembered if he adds standards rather than removes them, and that is without mentioning the Members who table amendments, the important role of lobbies and so on. Thus it is, ladies and gentlemen, that we arrive at a real regulatory monster.\nI have been in this Parliament for 17 years and, right from the very first year of my taking up my seat here, there was already a debate being held on the simplification of European Community law. I have the impression that we are no farther forward with this than we were 17 years ago, the only difference being that the situation has got even worse.\nWhat is to be done then? We have to agree on the meaning of the terms used. We need a proper dictionary of Community law, a code like the Civil Code, or the Commercial Code or the Penal Code, which is organised rationally and divided into parts, sub-parts, chapters, sections and articles, in such a way that, when we are working on a text, we know in advance that we are going to amend such and such an article. In short, we need to make a great effort towards simplification. I fear that, despite the good intentions expressed by the rapporteurs, we are not quite there yet. Thank you.", "lang": "FR", "original": "Bruno Gollnisch (NI). - Madame le Pr\u00e9sident, vous \u00eates une \u00e9minente sp\u00e9cialiste du Japon ancien de l\u2019\u00e9poque Tokugawa, au cours de laquelle on conservait le peuple volontairement dans l\u2019ignorance des lois class\u00e9es secret d\u2019\u00e9tat et dont la connaissance \u00e9tait r\u00e9serv\u00e9e \u00e0 un petit nombre de grands seigneurs, car l\u2019on pensait qu\u2019ainsi, le peuple \u00e9tait maintenu dans un respect beaucoup plus grand de normes dont il ignorait tout. Eh bien, je me demande parfois si nous ne nous inspirons pas effectivement de cette l\u00e9gislation japonaise ancienne.\nEn r\u00e9alit\u00e9, mes chers coll\u00e8gues, je crois que la complexit\u00e9 du droit europ\u00e9en est l\u2019effet pervers d\u2019une dynamique de groupe dont nous sommes int\u00e9gralement partie prenante. De quoi s\u2019agit-il? Premi\u00e8rement, l\u2019initiative appartient \u00e0 la Commission, mais derri\u00e8re chaque commissaire, se cachent \u00e9videmment la direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et les fonctionnaires qui la composent. Ensuite, cela passe au Conseil. Th\u00e9oriquement, le Conseil est compos\u00e9 des ministres. Ceux-ci se mettent d\u2019accord sur un texte, \u00e0 condition que chacune de leur bureaucratie respective y retrouve l\u2019int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 des normes qui doivent figurer dans le projet commun, puis le texte est transmis au Parlement et le Parlement nomme un rapporteur. Et, naturellement, le rapporteur - c\u2019est bien l\u00e9gitime - veut laisser son nom dans l\u2019histoire. Or il laissera bien davantage un nom s\u2019il ajoute des normes plut\u00f4t que s\u2019il en supprime, sans parler des coll\u00e8gues qui d\u00e9posent des amendements, du r\u00f4le important des lobbies, etc. C\u2019est ainsi, Mesdames et Messieurs, que nous arrivons \u00e0 un v\u00e9ritable monstre normatif.\nCela fait dix-sept ans que je suis dans ce Parlement et, d\u00e8s la premi\u00e8re ann\u00e9e o\u00f9 j\u2019ai si\u00e9g\u00e9 ici un d\u00e9bat sur la simplification du droit communautaire se tenait d\u00e9j\u00e0. J\u2019ai l\u2019impression qu\u2019on en est absolument au m\u00eame point qu\u2019il y a dix-sept ans, \u00e0 cette exception pr\u00e8s que la situation s\u2019est encore aggrav\u00e9e.\nAlors que faut-il? Il faut s\u2019entendre sur le sens des termes. Il faudrait un v\u00e9ritable dictionnaire de droit communautaire, un code comme le Code civil, ou le Code de commerce ou le Code p\u00e9nal, qui soit rationnellement organis\u00e9, divis\u00e9 en parties, en sous-parties, en chapitres, en sections et en articles, de telle fa\u00e7on que, quand nous travaillons sur un texte, nous sachions \u00e0 l\u2019avance que nous allons modifier tel ou tel article. Bref, il faut un grand effort de simplification. Je crains que malgr\u00e9 les bonnes volont\u00e9s exprim\u00e9es par les rapporteurs, nous n\u2019en soyons pas tout \u00e0 fait l\u00e0.
