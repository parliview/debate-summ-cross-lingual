{"speaker": "B\u00e9atrice Patrie (PSE). \u2013", "english": "B\u00e9atrice Patrie (PSE). \u2013 (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, under the guise of a technical debate, there is hidden here a debate of great political importance. We need better lawmaking, of course, but without deregulation and without sidelining the legislator itself. In this regard, I wish to express my very strong reservations about certain mechanisms, including alternative regulatory mechanisms such as regulation and self-regulation. They have their place but, in the interest of the citizens and of consumers, I believe that they must not, under any circumstances, take the place of the law, which confers rights but also duties and therefore constitutes the most legitimate democratic tool.\nAs regards consultation prior to the legislative process, I call on the three institutions to organise, alongside the economic operators, the actual participation of the social partners and of civil society in all its diversity. It is, in fact, the responsibility of the public authorities to support the organisation of these players - consumer associations, public service users, associations fighting against exclusion or community education associations \u2013 throughout Europe.\nFinally, I should like to comment on the simplification rolling programme that is supposed to facilitate the Lisbon Strategy. I am surprised that it includes as its main principle the recasting of the regulation on organic farming, when even the producers in this sector are not asking for that, and that proposals as important as those on the status of the mutual benefit associations and of the European Association have, at the same time, been withdrawn from the legislative programme.", "lang": "FR", "original": "B\u00e9atrice Patrie (PSE). - Madame la Pr\u00e9sidente, Mesdames et Messieurs, sous l\u2019aspect d\u2019un d\u00e9bat technique, se cache ici un d\u00e9bat d\u2019une grande importance politique.
