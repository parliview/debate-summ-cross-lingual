It is good to have an Austrian Minister as Fonzie, giving the thumbs up to better regulation!\nWe have three linked issues in this plenary session. The first, which we dealt with yesterday, was to do with transparency and the openness of the Council; the second is this debate on better regulation and legislation, and the last one we have this evening is on citizenship. I support all those initiatives; I think they are great; I think the work that the Secretary-General is doing in the Commission under Mr\u00a0Ponzano is extremely good and I would like to recommend all four reports that have been put on the table today.\nHaving said that and given that we are talking about better regulation, when I started going through the reports, I got a bit uneasy. I will just read you the language. I think there is a communication problem here. Mrs\u00a0Frassoni drew up a great report, but paragraph 18, \u2018Notes that the SOLVIT network has proved its effectiveness in the internal market as a complementary non-judicial mechanism which has increased voluntary cooperation among Member States\u00a0...\u2019. It is all true, but if you are sitting up there trying to listen to this, you are not necessarily going to understand what it means. Mr\u00a0Doorn, on better lawmaking, at paragraph 5, \u2018is of the opinion that the Lamfalussy procedure is a useful mechanism; regards the convergence of supervisory practices as crucial; welcomes the work of the Level 3 committees in this respect and supports the call for an adequate toolbox;\u2019 \u2013 great. Then, the McCarthy report \u2013 which I think is the clearest one \u2013 states in paragraph 6, \u2018requests that the Commission carry out both ex-ante and ex-post impact assessments on legislation to assist in identifying whether key policy objectives have been met\u00a0...\u2019, and the Gargani report has exactly the same. What I am trying to say is that we need better regulation, better lawmaking, but it is to do with simplification and us understanding what we are deciding on and people understanding what we are trying to decide on. That is what better regulation is all about; therefore, we need to use better language. I cannot imagine how that sounded through the Finnish interpretation!\n(Laughter and applause)", "lang": "EN", "original": "Alexander Stubb (PPE-DE). \u2013 Madam President, I cannot help it, but when I see the name Winkler up there, I immediately think about Henry Winkler: remember the guy who was Fonzie in Happy Days?
