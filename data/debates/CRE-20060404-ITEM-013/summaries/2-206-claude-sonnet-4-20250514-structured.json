{"speaker": "Marie-Line Reynaud (PSE),", "english": "Marie-Line Reynaud (PSE), draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs . \u2013 (FR) Madam President, I wish to thank Mr Gargani for the clarity and commitment of his report. I am delighted that a large part of my opinion has been included and that his report took up my own two objectives, which are, first of all, the emphasis given to the fact that simplification is necessary but must not be achieved in any old fashion, and secondly, the affirmation of Parliament\u2019s wish to participate fully in the simplification strategy. We can only welcome any initiative that aims to make the regulatory environment clearer and more coherent.\nIt is, in fact, impossible to continue working properly with an acquis of more than 80\u00a0000 pages. How, in these circumstances, can we talk to the citizens about accessibility and transparency with any credibility? That is why the simplification strategy must be supported in principle. It should enable us, in the long run, to have Community and national standards that are easier to apply and less costly. This simplification, however, also entails a number of limitations, indeed dangers, and we therefore need to be vigilant. In particular, this report specifies that simplification must not take the form of a lowering of standards, that there are problems linked to the application of the Interinstitutional Agreement governing the recasting procedure and that it is therefore necessary to clarify the applicable rules in order to avoid conflicts of competence and procedural obstacles. This report also clearly affirms Parliament\u2019s desire to fully participate in the simplification strategy and it puts the same emphasis on the need to protect Parliament\u2019s prerogatives as on the question of the adaptation of its rules of procedure. Simplification cannot, in fact, take place outside of all democratic control and, in particular, outside the control of Parliament.\nParliament must also give thought, within the context of simplification, to the improvement of its procedures and its internal legislative techniques. This issue will be the subject of a specific report that I am responsible for drafting. Finally, on the subject of alternative means of regulation, I am very pleased that this report demands a strict framework for recourse to coregulation and self-regulation, because it is essential to provide safeguards in this area.", "lang": "FR", "original": "Marie-Line Reynaud (PSE), rapporteur pour avis de la commission des affaires constitutionnelles . - Madame la Pr\u00e9sidente, je tiens \u00e0 remercier Monsieur Gargani pour la clart\u00e9 et l\u2019engagement de son rapport. Je me f\u00e9licite qu\u2019une tr\u00e8s grande partie de mon avis ait \u00e9t\u00e9 int\u00e9gr\u00e9 et que son rapport reprenne les deux objectifs qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 les miens, \u00e0 savoir tout d\u2019abord l\u2019accent mis sur le fait que la simplification est n\u00e9cessaire mais ne doit pas \u00eatre r\u00e9alis\u00e9e de n\u2019importe quelle mani\u00e8re, et en second lieu, l\u2019affirmation de la volont\u00e9 du Parlement de prendre pleinement part \u00e0 la strat\u00e9gie de simplification. Nous ne pouvons qu\u2019accueillir favorablement toute initiative visant \u00e0 rendre l\u2019environnement r\u00e9glementaire plus lisible et plus coh\u00e9rent.\nIl est en effet impossible de continuer \u00e0 fonctionner convenablement avec un acquis de plus de 80000 pages. Comment, dans ces conditions, parler de mani\u00e8re cr\u00e9dible aux citoyens d\u2019accessibilit\u00e9 et de transparence? C\u2019est pourquoi la strat\u00e9gie de simplification doit \u00eatre soutenue dans son principe. Elle doit permettre, \u00e0 terme, de disposer de normes communautaires et nationales plus faciles \u00e0 appliquer et moins co\u00fbteuses. Cependant, cette simplification comporte \u00e9galement un certain nombre de limites, voire de dangers, et il convient d\u00e8s lors de se monter vigilant. Ce rapport pr\u00e9cise notamment que la simplification ne doit pas se traduire par un abaissement des normes, qu\u2019il existe des probl\u00e8mes li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019application de l\u2019accord interinstitutionnel r\u00e9gissant la proc\u00e9dure de refonte et qu\u2019il est donc n\u00e9cessaire de clarifier les r\u00e8gles applicables pour \u00e9viter conflits de comp\u00e9tence et blocages proc\u00e9duraux. Ce rapport affirme \u00e9galement clairement la volont\u00e9 qu\u2019a le Parlement de prendre pleinement part \u00e0 la strat\u00e9gie de simplification et il met l\u2019accent tant sur la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de prot\u00e9ger les pr\u00e9rogatives du Parlement que sur la question de l\u2019adaptation de son r\u00e8glement int\u00e9rieur. La simplification ne peut en effet se faire en dehors de tout contr\u00f4le d\u00e9mocratique et, en particulier, en dehors du contr\u00f4le du Parlement.\nLe Parlement doit en outre r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir, dans le cadre de la simplification, \u00e0 l\u2019am\u00e9lioration de ses proc\u00e9dures et de ses techniques l\u00e9gislatives internes. Cette question fera l\u2019objet d\u2019un rapport sp\u00e9cifique que je suis charg\u00e9e de r\u00e9diger. Enfin, concernant les modes de r\u00e9gulation alternatifs, je me r\u00e9jouis que ce rapport demande un encadrement strict du recours \u00e0 la cor\u00e9gulation et \u00e0 l\u2019autor\u00e9gulation car il est fondamental de pr\u00e9voir des garde-fous en la mati\u00e8re.", "agenda_item": "Monitoring the application of Community law (2003-2004) - Better lawmaking 2004: application of the principle of subsidiarity - The implementation consequences and impact of the internal market legislation in force - Strategy for the simplification of the regulatory environment (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060404-ITEM-013", "intervention_id": "2-206", "summary_english": "{\n\"headline\": \"Parliament Must Fully Participate in EU Simplification Strategy While Maintaining Democratic Control and Standards\",\n\"issueSum\": \"The speaker addresses the EU's regulatory simplification strategy, highlighting the problem of an 80,000+ page acquis that undermines credibility regarding accessibility and transparency.
