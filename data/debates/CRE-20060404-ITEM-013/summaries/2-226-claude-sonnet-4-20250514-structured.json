{"speaker": "Andrzej Jan Szejna (PSE). \u2013", "english": "Andrzej Jan Szejna (PSE). \u2013 (PL) Madam\u00a0President, better lawmaking in the European Union calls for sound provisions formulated more transparently, and also for swifter and more effective implementation and application of such provisions. There are still too many instances of incorrect implementation of Community law. This is partly due to the poor quality of the provisions and partly to deliberate action by the Member States, intent on undermining Community legislation for political, economic or administrative reasons.\nIn addition, the national courts in many Member States are still reluctant to implement the principle of the primacy of Community legislation. If Union legislation is not deemed to be binding on all, and its transposition and implementation depend entirely on a government\u2019s good will, the outcome could be the objective renationalisation of Community policy, as Mrs\u00a0Frassoni rightly highlights in her report. Clearly, this would be very detrimental to the internal market and to the entire acquis .\nLack of uniformity of transposition may also lead to incorrect implementation of Union legislation should different provisions be implemented in different countries, thus undermining the Union\u2019s credibility. If we are not capable of bringing pressure to bear upon the governments of Member States to transpose Union legislation correctly, we cannot expect people to believe that Union institutions such as the Commission, the Council or the European Parliament will effectively defend citizens\u2019 rights derived from Union law.", "lang": "PL", "original": "Andrzej Jan Szejna (PSE). \u2013 Pani Przewodnicz\u0105ca!
