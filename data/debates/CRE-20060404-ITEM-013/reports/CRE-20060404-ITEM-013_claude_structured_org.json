As such, I should like to deliver a few messages about this report, the essential aim of which is to emphasise that the implementation of Community law forms an important part of the \u2018better lawmaking\u2019 dossier, alongside the other issues that we shall debate this afternoon.\nImplementation is an important part of law primarily because the situation at European Union level is unsatisfactory, as the Commission\u2019s report points out very effectively. There are very serious problems particularly concerning environmental legislation as well as legislation on the internal market, and responsibility for that \u2013 there is no point in denying it \u2013 lies above all with the Member States.\nNon-implementation is also due, however, to the fact that the procedure is enshrined in the Treaties and is therefore not easy to improve. It is a slow procedure that provides for relatively inadequate sanctions: in order to arrive at a positive solution for the implementation of Community law by the Member States, the procedure often leaves much to be desired and takes a very long time.\nI should like to hear whether you believe that this issue of the implementation of Community law is a priority for the Commission or not. Judging from the communication, it does not seem to me that it is, because, as we know, it deals more with the aspect of withdrawing and amending directives rather than their proper implementation.\nI believe that there are substantially two schools of thought in the Commission: one that says, \u2018It is best to avoid trouble with the Member States, so let us try to solve problems together with them,\u2019 whereas the other says, \u2018Let us apply the rules as they are, not inflexibly but at any rate positively, using procedures that as far as possible are fast and within the law.\u2019\nI should like to give some examples of that. We believe that several decisions made by the Commission regarding the initiation of certain procedures, such as those on GMOs in Austria, were made particularly quickly and effectively. On the other hand, in the case of France and its inability to implement the Natura 2000 Directive, we have been waiting for three years, ever since the Court of Justice\u2019s decision, for the Commission to intervene under Article 228, which is the article on fines.\nSimilarly, there are interesting situations regarding the citizens\u2019 right to reimbursement of their medical expenses. This is an extremely important issue for the people themselves, but we realise that it remains unresolved because it is a politically complicated issue to take on. At the same time, Article 228 has only been invoked twice: once for the Greek waste discharge case, which was suspended after a very short time, and once for the Spanish bathing water case, which was withdrawn at the last minute because of an issue that the Commission itself admits is rather dubious from a legal standpoint.\nWhat answer do we give or what proposals do we make to resolve a situation in which we believe that the Commission should act more transparently? First of all we believe that there should be greater surveillance and greater transparency regarding the ways in which Community law is implemented. I think it is important that the Commission pass on to us the compliance studies that it carries out on implementation of the law, which unfortunately we have not succeeded in obtaining.\nSecondly, I believe it is extremely important for resources to be transferred from all those bodies that will no longer produce legislation to those that will instead implement it. We do not agree with the idea, for instance, that there should be such a transfer to those who will carry out impact assessments, something that is currently being discussed in the Commission. Thirdly \u2013 and this affects us \u2013 we believe that the European Parliament should act much more specifically in the area of the implementation of Community law, not in order to change the Commission\u2019s powers \u2013 I am aware that this is of great concern to the members of that Institution \u2013 but, on the contrary, to gain a clearer idea of what actually happens, as the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and other committees do.\nI believe that the policy of naming and shaming with regard to the implementation of Community law is very useful and that the Commission should perhaps help us to apply it more decisively.", "lang": "IT", "original": "Monica Frassoni (Verts/ALE), relatrice . \u2013 Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, sono particolarmente lieta di prendere la parola oggi, non nella mia veste abituale di rappresentante del mio gruppo, ma come relatrice della commissione giuridica che rappresenta una maggioranza pi\u00f9 ampia. Come tale, vorrei lanciare alcuni messaggi su questa relazione, il cui obiettivo fondamentale \u00e8 di sottolineare che la questione dell\u2019applicazione del diritto comunitario costituisce una parte importante del dossier \u201clegiferare meglio\u201d come lo sono anche le altre questioni di cui parleremo questo pomeriggio.\nL\u2019applicazione \u00e8 una parte importante del diritto prima di tutto perch\u00e9, a livello dell\u2019Unione europea, la situazione \u2013 e lo dice molto bene la relazione della Commissione \u2013 non \u00e8 soddisfacente. Ci sono dei problemi molto gravi dal punto di vista soprattutto della legislazione ambientale, ma anche di quella relativa al mercato interno e la responsabilit\u00e0 \u00e8 soprattutto, inutile negarlo, degli Stati membri.\nLa responsabilit\u00e0 della mancata applicazione, \u00e8 tuttavia dovuta anche ad una procedura che, essendo contemplata nei Trattati, non \u00e8 facile da migliorare. Si tratta di una procedura lenta che prevede delle sanzioni relativamente insufficienti: per arrivare ad una soluzione positiva per quanto riguarda l\u2019applicazione del diritto comunitario da parte degli Stati membri spesso lascia a desiderare e prende moltissimo tempo.\nVorrei sapere se lei ritiene che tale questione dell\u2019applicazione del diritto comunitario costituisca o meno una priorit\u00e0 per la Commissione. Dal punto di vista della comunicazione non mi sembra che lo sia, perch\u00e9, come sappiamo, viene privilegiato maggiormente l\u2019aspetto del ritiro e della modifica delle direttive rispetto alla loro corretta applicazione.\nCredo che nella Commissione ci siano sostanzialmente due scuole di pensiero: una che dice: \u201cmeglio evitare i problemi con gli Stati membri, cerchiamo di risolvere insieme a loro i problemi\u201d e l\u2019altra che dice: \u201ccerchiamo, invece, di applicare le regole come sono, non in modo rigido, ma comunque in modo positivo, prendendo in considerazione delle procedure che siano il pi\u00f9 possibile rapide e rispettose del diritto\u201d.\nA tal proposito vorrei citare alcuni esempi: riteniamo che una serie di decisioni che sono state prese dalla Commissione rispetto all\u2019avvio di alcune procedure, come quelle sugli OGM in Austria, sia stata particolarmente veloce e particolarmente ben fatta, mentre invece, per quanto riguarda la Francia e la sua incapacit\u00e0 di applicare la direttiva \u201cNatura 2000\u201d, da tre anni aspettiamo che, dopo il pronunciamento della Corte di giustizia, la Commissione intervenga ai sensi dell\u2019articolo 228, ovvero l\u2019articolo relativo alle multe.\nAnalogamente, esistono delle situazioni interessanti per quanto riguarda il diritto dei cittadini al rimborso delle loro spese mediche. Sappiamo che questo tema, che \u00e8 importantissimo per i cittadini stessi, giace irrisolto perch\u00e9 \u00e8 un problema politicamente complicato da portare avanti. Allo stesso tempo, solo in due casi si \u00e8 fatto ricorso all\u2019articolo 228, ovvero per il caso delle discariche greche, che \u00e8 stato sospeso dopo pochissimo tempo, e per il caso delle acque di balneazione spagnole, ritirato all\u2019ultimo minuto per una questione che la Commissione stessa riconosce essere abbastanza dubbiosa dal punto di vista del diritto.\nChe risposta diamo o quali proposte presentiamo per risolvere una situazione per la quale riteniamo che Commissione debba agire in un modo pi\u00f9 trasparente? Prima di tutto riteniamo che ci debbano essere una migliore valutazione e una migliore trasparenza quanto alle modalit\u00e0 di applicazione del diritto. Penso che sia importante che la Commissione ci trasmetta gli studi di conformit\u00e0 che svolge sull\u2019applicazione del diritto, cosa che purtroppo non siamo riusciti a ottenere.\nIn secondo luogo, credo che sia importantissimo avere un trasferimento di risorse da tutti coloro che non faranno pi\u00f9 legislazione a coloro che invece si occuperanno dell\u2019applicazione. Non siamo d\u2019accordo, per esempio, con l\u2019idea che questo trasferimento avvenga con coloro che si occuperanno di impact assessment , cosa di cui si parla in questo momento nella Commissione, e, in terzo luogo \u2013 e questo, invece, riguarda noi \u2013 riteniamo che il Parlamento europeo debba intervenire in modo molto pi\u00f9 preciso sul tema dell\u2019applicazione del diritto comunitario, non per toccare le competenze della Commissione \u2013 so che questo \u00e8 un tema molto preoccupante per i membri di questa Istituzione \u2013 ma, al contrario, per arrivare, come fa la commissione ambiente e altre commissioni, ad avere un\u2019idea pi\u00f9 precisa di quello che succede.\nCredo che la politica del name and shame , anche nell\u2019applicazione del diritto comunitario, sia molto utile e che la Commissione, forse, dovrebbe aiutarci ad applicarla con maggiore decisione.", "agenda_item": "Monitoring the application of Community law (2003-2004) - Better lawmaking 2004: application of the principle of subsidiarity - The implementation consequences and impact of the internal market legislation in force - Strategy for the simplification of the regulatory environment (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060404-ITEM-013", "intervention_id": "2-194", "summary_english": "{\n\"headline\": \"EU Law Implementation Needs More Transparency, Resources and Effective Enforcement Procedures\",\n\"issueSum\": \"The speaker identifies serious problems with implementation of EU Community law, particularly in environmental legislation and internal market legislation.

The quote starts as follows: \u2018Not Barroso, not Blair, but Mr van Alphen from the Netherlands, along with thousands of other national civil servants, takes the day-to-day decisions in Europe\u2019. This article did nothing to contribute towards a positive basic perception in the Netherlands of the referendum. You know it all went horribly wrong. The Netherlands said no, which is worrying. It is these very rules and regulations that are a source of worry and that we should discuss in more detail today.\nWe must work hard in order to remove the negative image the citizen has of rules and regulations. How can we achieve this? We can do it by making them more transparent. We must also consider the administrative burden that results from them. Many companies have the mill stone of a heavy administrative burden round their necks, and if there is anything that affects companies\u2019 competitiveness, then this is it.\nHow do we achieve more transparency and cut the administrative burden? We can do it, in the first place, by carrying out an actual impact assessment, and that is what is still lacking at the moment. We have seen many examples of impact assessments, and they all vary in terms of quality. Some are good, and some are not. If we in this House want to benefit from impact assessments, then they should offer impartial and sound information that is readily understood. That is what is missing.\nWe in this House have first-hand experience of some impact assessments on amendments; we too have found that the quality varies, and that is why I propose an independent review of them. This need not be done by a weighty authority. This could be a panel of four experts in the field of impact assessment, who simply look at the impact assessments carried out by the Commission and those carried out in this House, and who then issue recommendations on that basis. In other words, there is no need for an agency or weighty authority; what we simply need is an independent quality review, one that is effective and external.\nTurning to comitology, the article I mentioned a moment ago had something to say about this too. It also included another paragraph, one about the committees, which I do not want to keep from you. \u2018You do not see them, you do not hear them, some 450 consulting clubs in Brussels, constantly take decisions that affect the everyday life of the citizens.\u2019 More transparency is needed in that area too. When comitology leads to secondary legislation, this legislation must also be verified. We must demonstrate the implications of legislation of that kind by means of an impact assessment. The public will then see that we mean business and that we actually want this transparency.\nFinally, as Mrs Frassoni already pointed out, implementation is extremely important and Parliament should devote far more attention to it. When a report has been discussed in the plenary, then the work of the rapporteur is done. I would suggest asking the rapporteur in question, three years after approval in this House, to notify his committee of the state of play in terms of implementation. This will contribute significantly to the proper transposal in the Member States and also to sound contacts with national parliaments.\nThose are the proposals: more transparency, objective supervision of the impact assessment, limits to comitology, more insight into comitology and possibly a call-back right for the European Parliament should the need arise. Those are the components of an inter-institutional agreement that I think are needed in order to really get going with these rules and regulations.", "lang": "NL", "original": "Bert Doorn (PPE-DE), rapporteur . \u2013 Voorzitter, ik citeer een artikel dat vorig jaar mei in een gezaghebbende Nederlandse krant stond, vlak v\u00f3\u00f3r het referendum in Nederland. Het citaat begint als volgt: \"Niet Barroso, niet Blair, maar mijnheer van Alphen uit Nederland en duizenden andere nationale ambtenaren nemen de dagelijkse beslissingen in Europa\". Dit artikel heeft absoluut niet bijgedragen tot een positieve grondhouding in Nederland jegens het referendum. U weet dat dat verkeerd afgelopen is. Nederland heeft neen gezegd. Zorgwekkend. Juist die regelgeving is een zorgenkind waarover we vandaag eens nader moeten praten.\nWe moeten hard werken om het negatieve beeld weg te nemen dat de burger van de regelgeving heeft. En hoe kunnen we dat bereiken? We kunnen dat bereiken door meer transparantie te bewerkstelligen. We moeten ook kijken naar de administratieve lasten die het gevolg zijn van de regelgeving. Veel bedrijven hebben de molensteen van de zware administratieve belasting om de hals hangen en als er iets is dat de concurrentiekracht van bedrijven be\u00efnvloedt, dan is het dat wel.\nVoorzitter, meer transparantie, minder administratieve lasten, hoe bereik je dat? In de eerste plaats door een daadwerkelijke effectentoetsing. En daar ontbreekt het op dit moment nog aan. Wij hebben vele voorbeelden gezien van effectbeoordelingen. Die zijn allemaal verschillend van kwaliteit. Sommige zijn goed, sommige zijn niet goed. Willen wij als Parlement wat hebben aan een effectbeoordeling, dan moet het een effectbeoordeling zijn die neutrale informatie biedt, die goede informatie biedt en die overzichtelijk is. Daaraan ontbreekt het.\nWij hebben zelf ook in het Parlement ervaring opgedaan met een paar effectbeoordelingen op amendementen. Ook daar is de kwaliteit wisselend. Vandaar mijn voorstel dat er een onafhankelijke toetsing komt van die effectbeoordelingen. Dat hoeft helemaal niet door een zware autoriteit te gebeuren. Dat kan een panel zijn, bestaande uit vier deskundigen op het gebied van effectbeoordeling, die gewoon eens kijken naar de effectbeoordelingen die de Commissie maakt en naar de effectbeoordelingen die wij hier in het Parlement maken, en die dan daarover adviezen geven. Dus geen agentschap, geen zware autoriteit, maar gewoon een onafhankelijke kwaliteitstoetsing, een effectieve externe kwaliteitstoetsing.\nVoorzitter, ik kom bij mijn volgende punt, de comitologie. Dat artikel waar ik het zojuist over had, ging met name over comitologie. Daar zat nog een andere passage die ik u niet wil onthouden. Het gaat over de comit\u00e9s. \"Je ziet ze niet, je hoort ze niet, zo een 450 overlegclubjes in Brussel nemen doorlopend beslissingen die het dagelijks leven van de burger raken.\" Ook hier geldt: meer transparantie. Ook hier geldt dat wanneer comitologie leidt tot secundaire wetgeving, die wetgeving moet worden getoetst. Ook daar moeten we met een effectbeoordeling laten zien wat de consequenties zijn van dat soort wetgeving. Dan ziet de burger ook echt dat het ons menens is en dat we die transparantie inderdaad willen.\nTenslotte, Voorzitter, de tenuitvoerlegging. De tenuitvoerlegging - collega Frassoni wees er al op - is buitengewoon belangrijk en ook het Parlement moet daaraan veel meer aandacht besteden. Als hier in de plenaire vergadering een verslag behandeld is, dan is het werk van de rapporteur afgelopen. Ik wil voorstellen dat we de rapporteur vragen om, drie jaar na de goedkeuring in het Parlement, zijn commissie op de hoogte te stellen van de gang van zaken rond de tenuitvoerlegging. Dit zal een wezenlijke bijdrage leveren aan de goede tenuitvoerlegging in de lidstaten en ook aan goede contacten met de nationale parlementen.\nDat zijn de voorstellen, Voorzitter: meer transparantie, een objectief toezicht op de effectbeoordeling, grenzen aan de comitologie, meer inzage in de comitologie, en eventueel ook een call-back- recht voor het Europees Parlement als daartoe aanleiding bestaat.

There is no doubt that this House is, as a matter of principle, backing the Commission in its efforts at simplifying the lawmaking process, but I also want to make it clear that here, as in so many other instances, the devil is in the detail, and that we have to be careful not to throw the baby out with the bathwater.\nLet me give you an example. Looking at this document from the Commission, for example, I see that they want to simplify the whole body of commercial and company law; now I know, as one of the Legal Affairs Committee\u2019s permanent rapporteurs on this area, that many of the directives and regulations we have enacted on this were the result of highly complex negotiations and compromises and that there is, in any proposal for simplification, the inherent risk of Pandora\u2019s box being opened and of the compromises arrived at after much effort ending up being once more open to question. That means that simplification is an instrument that must be handled with great care.\nIt is for that reason that I believe that it is very definitely advisable that we should give some thought, when simplifying just as much as when codifying, to the possibility of the three institutions adopting an inter-institutional agreement stating in clear terms how one goes about simplifying laws.\nA second point to which I should like the Commission to give some thought is the issue of what priorities simplification proposals should set. Directives are customarily addressed to the national legislatures rather than to the public, and the laws with which practitioners have to deal are those enacted at the national level. It follows that the simplification of directives should be no more than a secondary objective. The Commission should give priority to regulations, for the simple reason that regulations are directly applicable as law and have a direct effect on those members of the public who have recourse to law.\nThe second issue has to do with impact assessment. I want once more to ram home the point that most of us in this House regard an independent element in the assessment of laws\u2019 impact as vitally necessary. In a report it produced in December, this House called for an independent agency on the American model. For my part, I want to make it clear that this is not a conditio sine qua non for me; it is something we can talk about. What I do regard as indispensable, though, is the participation of an independent external element in the assessment of the impact laws have. It is not acceptable that the officials who make proposals are also and at the same time the ones who are responsible for gauging what impact those proposals will have, for the consequence of that is that the impact assessment ends up being no more and no less than part of the justification for them, and that is not what we want. It is for that reason, then, that I believe we have to hammer out something sensible with the Commission in relation to this issue.\nAn inter-institutional agreement has been in place since December 2003, according to which the Commission is, in principle, responsible for the impact assessment. That also means, though, that it is exercising a responsibility with and on behalf of the legislature, that is to say, for Parliament and the Council, and so we believe that we in this House, too, should have \u2013 and do have \u2013 a right to be consulted as to how this impact assessment is carried out.\nI might add that that is also the reason why we, in the Conference of Presidents, initially delayed adopting a resolution on the follow-up administrative agreements, since these, of course, have to be renegotiated, not least in the light of the resolutions that we will be adopting on these four reports in May of this year.\nI would also like to say something about something that is very definitely a live issue. On 16 March, Advocate-General Sharpston delivered an opinion in the case of Spain versus the Council, in the conclusions to which she refers explicitly to the impact assessment, stating that the absence of any adequate impact assessment is an indication of the legal act having been adopted arbitrarily, and that demonstrates and confirms the Court of Justice\u2019s increasing interest in this issue.\nFurther to what Mr Doorn has had to say on the subject, I think it is crucial that decisions arrived at by way of comitology also need to have their impact assessed. There are a whole load of cases that we could take as examples, where the real bureaucratic madness lay in the comitological decisions rather than in the legislation itself, so, here too, there needs to be proper monitoring of what impact laws have.\nLast of all, let me turn to the third issue, that of stake holder consultation , that is to say the process whereby the interested parties are listened to. In preparing legislation, the Commission has come to rely very heavily on Europe-wide organisations and associations. I have nothing against the European lobbying associations, but the processes whereby they arrive at decisions are sometimes more complex than those in the Council of Ministers, and what emerges from them is often consensus compacted into nonsense. I believe we need still other forms of consultative machinery in order to get the information directly from those interested parties who are working at their jobs and therefore have to deal with these issues. So, for example, the consultative machinery we came up with through the network currently engaged in developing European contract law, with which we defined a limited category of person to be consulted, could be a good example of how to improve these mechanisms.", "lang": "DE", "original": "Klaus-Heiner Lehne (PPE-DE), stellvertretender Berichterstatter . \u2013 Herr Pr\u00e4sident, meine sehr verehrten Damen und Herren! Lassen Sie mich etwas zu drei Aspekten sagen, erstens zum Thema Vereinfachung: Es gibt keinen Zweifel daran, dass das Europ\u00e4ische Parlament grunds\u00e4tzlich hinter den Bestrebungen der Kommission steht, die Gesetzgebung zu vereinfachen. Aber ich will auch deutlich sagen, dass die T\u00fccke hier wie in vielen anderen F\u00e4llen nat\u00fcrlich im Detail liegt und dass man aufpassen muss, dass man das Kind nicht mit dem Bade aussch\u00fcttet.\nIch will auf ein Beispiel verweisen: Wenn ich zum Beispiel dem Dokument der Kommission entnehme, dass man das gesamte Handels- und Gesellschaftsrecht vereinfachen will, dann wei\u00df ich als einer der st\u00e4ndigen Berichterstatter im Rechtsausschuss f\u00fcr dieses Themenfeld, dass viele Richtlinien und Regelungen, die wir dort gefunden haben, das Ergebnis h\u00f6chst komplexer Kompromissverhandlungen gewesen sind und dass ein Vereinfachungsvorschlag immer das Risiko beinhaltet, dass die B\u00fcchse der Pandora aufgemacht wird und am Ende nach vielen M\u00fchen erreichte Kompromisse wieder in Frage gestellt werden. Vor diesem Hintergrund muss man mit dem Instrument der Vereinfachung sehr sorgsam umgehen.\nDeshalb bin ich der Ansicht, dass es durchaus sinnvoll ist, dar\u00fcber nachzudenken, ob man nicht \u00e4hnlich wie bei der Kodifikation auch bei der Vereinfachung eine interinstitutionelle Vereinbarung zwischen den drei Organen erl\u00e4sst, mit der die klare Vorgehensweise bei Vereinfachungsgesetzen festgelegt wird.\nEin zweiter Punkt, \u00fcber den ich die Kommission nachzudenken bitte, ist die Frage der Priorit\u00e4tensetzung bei Vereinfachungsvorschl\u00e4gen. Richtlinien richten sich \u00fcblicherweise nicht an die B\u00fcrger, sondern an die nationalen Gesetzgeber, und die Praktiker m\u00fcssen am Ende mit den Gesetzen umgehen, die auf nationaler Ebene erlassen werden. Von daher sollten Richtlinien nur nachrangig vereinfacht werden. Die Kommission sollte die Priorit\u00e4t auf Verordnungen legen, weil Verordnungen nun einmal unmittelbar anwendbares Recht sind und beim rechtsuchenden Publikum unmittelbar ankommen.\nZweiter Themenkomplex: Gesetzesfolgenabsch\u00e4tzung. Ich will noch einmal nachdr\u00fccklich betonen, dass aus der Sicht der Parlamentsmehrheit ein unabh\u00e4ngiges Element in der Gesetzesfolgenabsch\u00e4tzung zwingend notwendig ist. Das Parlament hat im Dezember in einem Bericht eine unabh\u00e4ngige Agentur nach amerikanischem Vorbild verlangt. Ich will f\u00fcr mich deutlich sagen, dass das f\u00fcr mich keine conditio sine qua non ist. \u00dcber so etwas kann man reden. Unverzichtbar f\u00fcr mich ist jedoch, dass es einen unabh\u00e4ngigen externen Faktor gibt, der an der Gesetzesfolgenabsch\u00e4tzung teilnehmen muss. Es kann nicht sein, dass die Beamten, die die Vorschl\u00e4ge machen, auch gleichzeitig alleine f\u00fcr die Gesetzesfolgenabsch\u00e4tzung verantwortlich sind, weil die Konsequenz dann die ist, dass diese Folgenabsch\u00e4tzung nichts anderes ist als Bestandteil der Begr\u00fcndung. Das ist nicht das, was wir wollen. Meines Erachtens ist es deshalb erforderlich, in dieser Frage zu einem vern\u00fcnftigen Ergebnis mit der Kommission zu kommen.\nWir haben eine interinstitutionelle Vereinbarung seit Dezember 2003. In dieser Vereinbarung ist festgelegt, dass die Kommission grunds\u00e4tzlich f\u00fcr das impact assessment verantwortlich ist. Das bedeutet aber auch, dass sie im Wesentlichen damit eine Verantwortung f\u00fcr den Gesetzgeber mit aus\u00fcbt, also f\u00fcr Parlament und Rat, und deshalb glauben wir, dass wir als Parlament auch ein Mitspracherecht hinsichtlich der Art der Durchf\u00fchrung des impact assessment haben und haben sollten.\nDas ist \u00fcbrigens auch der Grund, weshalb wir innerhalb der Konferenz der Pr\u00e4sidenten die Beschlussfassung \u00fcber die follow-up- Verwaltungsvereinbarungen zun\u00e4chst einmal ausgesetzt haben, weil dies nat\u00fcrlich noch einmal verhandelt werden muss, auch im Lichte der Beschl\u00fcsse, die wir zu diesen hier vorliegenden vier Berichten im Mai dieses Jahres fassen werden.\nLassen Sie mich noch auf einen ganz aktuellen Punkt Bezug nehmen. Es gibt seit dem 16. M\u00e4rz einen Vortrag der Generalanw\u00e4ltin Sharpston in dem Verfahren Spanien gegen den Rat, in dem sie in ihren Schlussantr\u00e4gen ausdr\u00fccklich auch auf das impact assessment Bezug nimmt. Sie hat gesagt, wenn kein ausreichendes impact assessment vorgenommen wird, dann ist das ein Indiz daf\u00fcr, dass der Rechtsakt willk\u00fcrlich erlassen worden ist. Das beweist und belegt, dass sich auch der Gerichtshof zunehmend dieser Thematik annimmt.\nIch halte es f\u00fcr entscheidend \u2013 der Kollege Doorn hat schon darauf hingewiesen\u00a0\u2013, dass auch Komitologieentscheidungen einer Gesetzesfolgenabsch\u00e4tzung bed\u00fcrfen. Es gibt eine Vielzahl von Beispielsf\u00e4llen, wo der eigentliche b\u00fcrokratische Wahnsinn in den Komitologieentscheidungen lag und nicht in der Gesetzgebung. Also bedarf es auch hier einer vern\u00fcnftigen Gesetzesfolgenkontrolle.\nLassen Sie mich auf einen allerletzten Punkt kommen; er betrifft das dritte Thema: stake holder consultation, also Anh\u00f6rung der Beteiligten. Die Kommission st\u00fctzt sich in ihrer bisherigen Art und Weise, wie sie die Gesetzgebung vorbereitet, sehr stark auf die europ\u00e4ischen Dachverb\u00e4nde. Nichts gegen die europ\u00e4ischen Lobby-Dachverb\u00e4nde. Aber die Entscheidungsprozesse in diesen Dachverb\u00e4nden sind manchmal komplizierter als im Ministerrat. Und das, was dort herauskommt, ist oftmals die Verdichtung des Konsens zum Nonsens. Ich glaube, wir brauchen noch andere Konsultationsmechanismen, mit denen man die Information unmittelbar von den Betroffenen bekommt, die im Arbeitsleben stehen und die entsprechend mit diesen Themen befasst sind. So k\u00f6nnte etwa der Konsultationsmechanismus, der im Netzwerk gefunden wurde, mit dem im Augenblick das europ\u00e4ische Vertragsrecht entwickelt wird und mit dem man einen begrenzten Teil von Leuten definiert hat, die man konsultiert, ein gutes Beispiel daf\u00fcr sein, wie man diese Mechanismen verbessern kann.", "agenda_item": "Monitoring the application of Community law (2003-2004) - Better lawmaking 2004: application of the principle of subsidiarity - The implementation consequences and impact of the internal market legislation in force - Strategy for the simplification of the regulatory environment (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060404-ITEM-013", "intervention_id": "2-197", "summary_english": "{\n\"headline\": \"Calls for careful, prioritized approach to EU law simplification with independent impact assessment and improved stakeholder consultation\",\n\"issueSum\": \"The speaker addresses three main issues: the need for careful simplification of EU legislation without undermining existing compromises, the necessity of independent impact assessment for proposed laws, and the need to improve stakeholder consultation processes beyond relying solely on Europe-wide organizations.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"The speaker supports the Commission's simplification efforts but advocates for a cautious approach with inter-institutional agreements.

I know from my own, very close, contacts with the public over recent months that the issue of \u2018Better Lawmaking\u2019, along with everything that is associated with it \u2013 perhaps not as a slogan, for many of them do not know what it stands for, but as a principle \u2013 is one of the issues of greatest interest to them.\nAs you know, the Commission\u2019s programme for this year is under the heading of \u2018unlocking Europe\u2019s full potential\u2019, and rightly too. The Council is convinced that better lawmaking will be crucial in making this possible. It is our intention that lawmaking should support the citizen rather than hampering him, and the same is true \u2013 as Mrs McCarthy has already said \u2013 of the consumer, but it is most especially the case in business life, where too little has been done to foster the dynamism and creativity of small and medium-sized businesses in particular. Only recently, the European Council indicated its desire to promote small and medium-sized enterprises and provided some impetus in that direction. Studies have shown us that the administrative burden for businesses and members of the public is equivalent to between 2% and 5% of European GNP, and so it is our intention that a marked upturn in competitiveness be brought about by assessing the impact of the administrative burden, simplification, and a reduction in it.\nThe term \u2018better regulation\u2019 is one that has recently been in frequent use, and I certainly agree with Mr Lehne that we should not throw out the baby with the bathwater and that this term is very often used rather loosely, and in such a way as to devalue it, in that it is not always clear what is meant by it. I can say on behalf of the Council that your House\u2019s engagement with this issue in no fewer than four reports today is very much to be welcomed.\nThe Council presidency continues to regard the Inter-Institutional Agreement on Better Lawmaking, to which reference has already been made today, as the framework for our cooperation. We intend to collaborate with the future Finnish Presidency, with the Commission, and, of course, with your House, in further advancing the agenda for the reform of the regulatory framework.\nLet me discuss in greater detail some of the areas that are significant in this context.\nI will start with simplification. The simplification of EU regulations is something that has a tangible effect on businesses and the public, and it is for that reason that it will be particularly efficient if it also enables us to gain greater credibility. Commissioner Verheugen\u2019s screening initiative and the current plans for sectoral simplification and further efforts at horizontal simplification put us on the right track. I am also very impressed by the presence of the President and the Vice-President in this House today and by their participation in this debate, for we must encourage further progress down this road, and that is precisely what the Council and the Commission are doing by doing something to bring Europe closer to its citizens. As you know, the Austrian Presidency has to some extent taken \u2018bringing Europe closer to its citizens again\u2019 as its watchword, and these initiatives, including those on the part of the Commission, make a substantial contribution to doing that. They also help Europe to be successful in achieving the Lisbon targets. The Presidency of the Council is glad to see that the Commission is not only pursuing the \u2018simplification of existing legislation\u2019 by means of a general weeding-out of the acquis , but is also planning to include in this the outcome of the Council\u2019s efforts in this area.\nTogether with the future Finnish Presidency and the Commission, we are working towards better working methods for simplification and towards maximising the efficiency of the cooperation between the Council, the Commission and Parliament, and so it is also useful that the Commission should, on an annual basis, provide the Council with information on its programme of simplification. We also propose that the simplification dossiers be put near the top of our agendas, and that the Council and Parliament should endeavour, where possible, to adopt simplification dossiers at first reading.\nThe burden of administration \u2013 to which reference has already been made \u2013 upon the persons it affects is, of course, directly measurable and affects them directly. We need instruments in the European sphere to do just that. Such instruments exist; now all we have to do is to use them. The Presidency of the Council is currently drafting a paper on the prescription of quantitative targets in this area.\nAs my third point, I would like to turn to the subject of the choice of legal instruments, for, whatever our efforts towards improving lawmaking, there are a number of important aspects of which we must not lose sight, among them the subsidiarity principle and the principle of proportionality, while at the same time taking care to ensure that the acquis communautaire remains intact. It is not less Europe, but a better Europe, that we would like to see.\nThe principles of subsidiarity and of proportionality are fundamental guidelines for action by the institutions in their exercise of EU competences and hence an integral part of better lawmaking.\nSubsidiarity and proportionality also play a central role in the choice of legal instruments. In carrying out impact assessments, several alternative courses of action need to be considered, one of which must be the option of acting at a lower level than the EU itself.\nContrariwise, though, the interests of legal clarity and the smooth functioning of the internal market can be better served by regulations than by directives, and that, too, has been referred to today. All in all, it is crucial that, in each individual case, the instrument should be chosen that best enables Europe to achieve what regulation is intended to do, and so, in practice, there is a close connection between impact assessments, which are of considerable value qualitatively speaking, and the effective application of subsidiarity and proportionality.\nBoth the Council and Parliament are already obliged by the inter-institutional agreement to have extensive recourse to the Commission\u2019s impact assessments in the process of arriving at decisions. These impact assessments by the Commission can therefore also serve as the basis for an active discussion of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. Perhaps I might take this opportunity to reiterate that we intend, in order to add depth to this discussion, to organise a conference on subsidiarity in Austria on 18 and 19 April, at which we look forward to valuable contributions from your House.\nAs was generally stressed today, impact assessments must be produced to the highest possible standards of quality and must then actually be used in the negotiating process; The Austrian Presidency of the Council will be producing what might be termed a handbook for chairmen of Council working groups with the title \u2018 How to Handle Impact Assessments in Council \u2019.\nWe also want to encourage more cooperation between the institutions, particularly in respect of assessing the impact of major amendments proposed by the Council and in the consistent adherence to the agreed modus operandi in all three of them, and, with this in mind, we look forward with great interest to the Commission\u2019s impact assessment review, which has been announced for this spring.\nOverall, the presidency shares your House\u2019s view that high quality impact assessments are essential components of an improved regulatory framework.\nSomething else to which reference was made was the involvement of what are termed \u2018stakeholders\u2019 in consultation processes, which is vital if there is to be greater transparency. Interested parties must be fully informed about the options for consultation, account must be taken of their views when policies are drawn up, and they must also be given proper feedback.\nLet me conclude by adding something about transparency. If the public are to accept the decisions we take, it is important not only that the laws we enact be comprehensible and simple, but also that we do a better job of explaining how these decisions are arrived at. The decision-making process needs to be as transparent as possible for the general public. Our Federal Chancellor said this when presenting the Austrian Council programme, and it is a point I have emphasised on many occasions. The Austrian Presidency of the Council attaches importance to continued progress in transparency. The first steps have been taken by way of the resolutions adopted last December, on the basis of which we are now attempting to give this practical expression and, where possible, to highlight other ways in which greater transparency may be achieved.\nAs I said at the outset, \u2018better lawmaking\u2019 is a project of public relevance and of direct concern to all of us. If it is accomplished successfully, we will, together, have been able to add real value and to again make the benefits of the European Union clearer to its citizens.", "lang": "DE", "original": "Hans Winkler, amtierender Ratspr\u00e4sident . Herr Pr\u00e4sident! Ich freue mich, dass ich die Gelegenheit habe, heute mit Ihnen \u00fcber ein Thema zu diskutieren, das f\u00fcr Europa sehr wichtig ist. Ich wei\u00df aus meinen eigenen, sehr intensiven Kontakten mit den B\u00fcrgerinnen und B\u00fcrgern in den letzten Monaten, dass das Thema Bessere Gesetzgebung und alles, was damit verbunden ist \u2013 vielleicht nicht als Schlagwort, viele B\u00fcrger wissen nicht, was sich dahinter verbirgt, aber als Prinzip\u00a0\u2013, eines der Themen ist, die die B\u00fcrger am allermeisten besch\u00e4ftigen.\nDas Programm der Kommission f\u00fcr dieses Jahr tr\u00e4gt ja bekanntlich zu Recht den Titel \u201eDas ganze Potenzial Europas freisetzen\u201c. Der Rat ist davon \u00fcberzeugt, dass eine bessere Gesetzgebung entscheidend ist, um die Grundlage daf\u00fcr zu schaffen. Unsere Gesetzgebung soll die B\u00fcrger unterst\u00fctzen, nicht einengen. Dies gilt \u2013 wie bereits von Frau McCarthy gesagt wurde \u2013 f\u00fcr den Verbraucher; es gilt aber nat\u00fcrlich auch ganz besonders im Wirtschaftsleben, wo die Dynamik und Kreativit\u00e4t vor allem der kleineren und mittleren Unternehmen oft zu wenig gef\u00f6rdert wurde. Erst vor kurzem hat der Europ\u00e4ische Rat Signale und Impulse gesetzt, gerade die kleinen und mittleren Unternehmen zu f\u00f6rdern. Wir wissen aus Studien, dass die Verwaltungsbelastung f\u00fcr Unternehmen und B\u00fcrger zwischen zwei und f\u00fcnf Prozent des europ\u00e4ischen BIP ausmacht. Wir wollen daher durch Folgenabsch\u00e4tzung, Vereinfachung und Reduktion des Verwaltungsaufwandes eine deutliche St\u00e4rkung der Wettbewerbsf\u00e4higkeit erzielen.\nBessere Gesetzgebung ist ein Begriff, der in der letzten Zeit sehr oft verwendet wurde. Ich stimme hier durchaus mit Herrn Lehne \u00fcberein, dass man das Kind nicht mit dem Bade aussch\u00fctten soll und dass dieser Begriff sehr oft auch etwas inflation\u00e4r und etwas locker gebraucht wird, wobei auch nicht immer klar ist, was darunter zu verstehen ist. Ich begr\u00fc\u00dfe es daher im Namen des Rates ganz besonders, dass sich das Parlament heute in nicht weniger als vier Berichten mit diesem Thema besch\u00e4ftigt.\nDer Ratsvorsitz sieht in der Interinstitutionellen Vereinbarung \u00fcber bessere Rechtsetzung, die heute auch schon genannt wurde, weiterhin den Rahmen f\u00fcr unsere Zusammenarbeit. Wir beabsichtigen, in Zusammenarbeit mit dem k\u00fcnftigen finnischen Vorsitz, der Kommission und selbstverst\u00e4ndlich mit Ihrem Haus die Agenda f\u00fcr die Reform des Regelungsrahmens weiter voranzubringen.\nIch m\u00f6chte auf einige der Bereiche, die in diesem Zusammenhang von Bedeutung sind, etwas n\u00e4her eingehen.\nZun\u00e4chst zur Vereinfachung: Die Vereinfachung von EU-Vorschriften ist f\u00fcr Unternehmen und B\u00fcrger greifbar; daher ist es auch besonders effizient, wenn es uns gelingt, hier mehr Glaubw\u00fcrdigkeit zu erzeugen. Mit der Screening-Initiative von Kommissar Verheugen und den aktuellen Pl\u00e4nen f\u00fcr sektorale Vereinfachungen sowie weiteren horizontalen Vereinfachungsbem\u00fchungen sind wir auf dem richtigen Weg. Ich bin auch sehr beeindruckt, dass der Pr\u00e4sident und der Vizepr\u00e4sident heute hier sind und an dieser Debatte teilnehmen, denn wir m\u00fcssen \u2013 und das tun Rat und Kommission auch \u2013 dazu ermutigen, auf diesem Weg weiter voranzuschreiten. Denn hier tun wir etwas f\u00fcr gr\u00f6\u00dfere B\u00fcrgern\u00e4he. Wie Sie wissen, steht die \u00f6sterreichische Pr\u00e4sidentschaft ein bisschen unter dem Motto \u201eEuropa wieder den B\u00fcrgern n\u00e4her bringen\u201c, und diese Initiativen, auch der Kommission, tragen sehr dazu bei. Sie tragen auch dazu bei, dass Europa bei der Erreichung der Lissabon-Ziele erfolgreich sein kann. Der Ratsvorsitz begr\u00fc\u00dft, dass die Kommission im Bereich \u201eVereinfachung von bestehenden Rechtsvorschriften\u201c neben der generellen Durchforstung des Aquis auch plant, die Ergebnisse der Anstrengungen, die der Rat dazu unternommen hat, mit einzubeziehen.\nWir streben zusammen mit dem k\u00fcnftigen finnischen Vorsitz und der Kommission bessere Arbeitsmethoden f\u00fcr die Vereinfachung und eine m\u00f6glichst effiziente Zusammenarbeit zwischen Rat, Kommission und Parlament an. Daher ist es auch n\u00fctzlich, dass die Kommission den Rat j\u00e4hrlich \u00fcber ihr Vereinfachungsprogramm unterrichtet. Wir schlagen auch vor, den Vereinfachungsdossiers in den Tagesordnungen Priorit\u00e4t einzur\u00e4umen und dass Rat und Parlament anstreben, Vereinfachungsdossiers wenn m\u00f6glich in erster Lesung anzunehmen.\nDie Verwaltungsbelastungen \u2013 die auch bereits angesprochen wurden \u2013 sind nat\u00fcrlich f\u00fcr die Betroffenen direkt messbar und haben unmittelbare Wirkungen. Wir ben\u00f6tigen dazu Instrumente im europ\u00e4ischen Bereich. Diese Instrumente gibt es, nun m\u00fcssen wir sie aber auch benutzen. Die Ratspr\u00e4sidentschaft arbeitet derzeit ein Papier zur Vorgabe von quantitativen Zielen in diesem Bereich aus.\nAls drittes Thema m\u00f6chte ich mich der Frage der Wahl des Rechtsinstruments widmen. Denn bei allen Bem\u00fchungen um eine bessere Rechtsetzung d\u00fcrfen wir einige wichtige Aspekte nicht aus den Augen verlieren: das Subsidiarit\u00e4tsprinzip und den Grundsatz der Verh\u00e4ltnism\u00e4\u00dfigkeit. Wir m\u00fcssen aber gleichzeitig darauf achten, dass der gemeinschaftliche Besitzstand gewahrt bleibt. Wir w\u00fcnschen uns ein besseres Europa, aber wir w\u00fcnschen uns nicht weniger Europa.\nDie Grunds\u00e4tze der Subsidiarit\u00e4t und der Verh\u00e4ltnism\u00e4\u00dfigkeit sind zentrale \u201eHandlungsanleitungen\u201c der Institutionen bei der Aus\u00fcbung von Unionskompetenzen und daher integraler Bestandteil der besseren Rechtsetzung.\nSubsidiarit\u00e4t und Verh\u00e4ltnism\u00e4\u00dfigkeit spielen auch eine zentrale Rolle bei der Wahl des Rechtsinstruments. Bei der Durchf\u00fchrung von Folgenabsch\u00e4tzungen sind mehrere Handlungsalternativen zu pr\u00fcfen; darunter eben auch die Option, nicht im Rahmen der Union, sondern auf untergeordneter Ebene t\u00e4tig zu werden.\nUmgekehrt k\u00f6nnen aber auch Verordnungen im Interesse der rechtlichen Klarheit und des reibungslosen Funktionierens des Binnenmarkts angemessener sein als Richtlinien \u2013 auch das wurde heute schon angesprochen. Insgesamt ist es entscheidend, jeweils im Einzelfall das Handlungsinstrument auszuw\u00e4hlen, mit dem Europa das Ziel der Regelung am besten erreichen kann. Daher gibt es in der Praxis einen engen Zusammenhang zwischen qualitativ hochwertigen Folgenabsch\u00e4tzungen und der effektiven Anwendung der Subsidiarit\u00e4t und der Verh\u00e4ltnism\u00e4\u00dfigkeit.\nAuch Rat und Parlament sind bereits \u2013 auf der Grundlage der Interinstitutionellen Vereinbarung \u2013 verpflichtet, im politischen Entscheidungsfindungsprozess umfassend auf die Folgenabsch\u00e4tzungen der Kommission zur\u00fcckzugreifen. Diese Folgenabsch\u00e4tzungen der Kommission bieten sich daher auch als Grundlage f\u00fcr eine aktive Diskussion des Subsidiarit\u00e4ts- und Verh\u00e4ltnism\u00e4\u00dfigkeitsgrundsatzes an. Ich darf hier noch einmal erw\u00e4hnen, dass wir zur Vertiefung dieser Diskussion am 18. und 19. April in \u00d6sterreich eine Konferenz zur Subsidiarit\u00e4t veranstalten wollen, bei der wir auch auf wertvolle Beitr\u00e4ge aus Ihrem Haus hoffen.\nDie Folgenabsch\u00e4tzungen m\u00fcssen \u2013 wie auch allgemein heute unterstrichen wurde \u2013 in bestm\u00f6glicher Qualit\u00e4t erstellt und dann auch im Verhandlungsprozess genutzt werden. Die \u00f6sterreichische Ratspr\u00e4sidentschaft wird eine Art Handbuch f\u00fcr Vorsitzende von Ratsarbeitsgruppen mit dem Titel \u201eHow to Handle Impact Assessments in Council\u201c vorlegen .\nWir wollen auch die interinstitutionelle Zusammenarbeit weiter f\u00f6rdern, insbesondere bei der Folgenabsch\u00e4tzung f\u00fcr bedeutende Ab\u00e4nderungsvorschl\u00e4ge durch den Rat und bei der konsistenten Anwendung der vereinbarten Vorgangsweise in allen drei Organen. In diesem Zusammenhang erwarten wir mit gro\u00dfem Interesse die \u00dcberpr\u00fcfung der Folgenabsch\u00e4tzung der Kommission, die f\u00fcr dieses Fr\u00fchjahr angek\u00fcndigt wurde.\nDer Ratsvorsitz teilt insgesamt die Ansicht des Europ\u00e4ischen Parlaments, dass qualitativ hochwertige Folgenabsch\u00e4tzungen wesentliche Voraussetzung f\u00fcr einen verbesserten Regelungsrahmen sind.\nDie Einbindung \u2013 auch das wurde schon erw\u00e4hnt \u2013 der so genannten stake holders im Rahmen von Konsultationsprozessen ist wichtig f\u00fcr mehr Transparenz. Die Betroffenen m\u00fcssen \u00fcber Konsultationsm\u00f6glichkeiten umfassend informiert werden, ihre Meinung muss in die Politikerstellung einflie\u00dfen, und sie m\u00fcssen dar\u00fcber auch wirksames Feedback erhalten.\nSchlie\u00dflich noch ein Wort zur Transparenz: Wichtig f\u00fcr die Akzeptanz unserer Entscheidungen bei den B\u00fcrgerinnen und B\u00fcrgern ist nicht nur, dass wir verst\u00e4ndliche und einfache Gesetze machen, sondern dazu geh\u00f6rt auch, dass wir besser erkl\u00e4ren, wie Entscheidungen zustande kommen. Der Weg zur Beschlussfassung soll f\u00fcr die \u00d6ffentlichkeit so transparent wie m\u00f6glich sein. Unser Bundeskanzler hat es in seiner Vorstellung des \u00f6sterreichischen Ratsprogramms gesagt, und auch ich habe es bereits bei mehreren Gelegenheiten betont: Der \u00f6sterreichischen Ratspr\u00e4sidentschaft sind weitere Fortschritte in der Frage der Transparenz wichtig. Erste Schritte sind gesetzt durch Beschl\u00fcsse, die im vergangenen Dezember gefasst wurden. Auf dieser Basis versuchen wir nun, dies in die Praxis umzusetzen und, wenn m\u00f6glich, auch noch weitere Schritte aufzuzeigen, wie wir zu mehr Transparenz kommen sollen.\nWie ich zu Beginn gesagt habe: Die Bessere Gesetzgebung ist ein Projekt, das die B\u00fcrgerinnen und B\u00fcrger, das uns alle direkt angeht. Wenn wir hier erfolgreich sind, k\u00f6nnen wir gemeinsam einen konkreten Mehrwert schaffen und den B\u00fcrgerinnen und B\u00fcrgern den Nutzen der Europ\u00e4ischen Union wieder deutlicher machen.", "agenda_item": "Monitoring the application of Community law (2003-2004) - Better lawmaking 2004: application of the principle of subsidiarity - The implementation consequences and impact of the internal market legislation in force - Strategy for the simplification of the regulatory environment (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060404-ITEM-013", "intervention_id": "2-198", "summary_english": "{\n\"headline\": \"Austrian Council Presidency Emphasizes Better Lawmaking to Reduce Administrative Burden and Bring Europe Closer to Citizens\",\n\"issueSum\": \"The speaker addresses several key issues related to better lawmaking in the EU: the administrative burden on businesses and citizens equivalent to 2-5% of European GNP; the need for simplification of EU regulations; the importance of proper application of subsidiarity and proportionality principles; the requirement for high-quality impact assessments; and the need for greater transparency in EU decision-making processes.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"The speaker strongly supports the better lawmaking agenda as crucial for unlocking Europe's potential and making the EU more citizen-friendly.

(FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, European legislation is central to everything that makes the European Union special. We are, in fact, a Community based on the rule of law. Without law, we should have to rely on continual negotiation, on the balance of power between the Member States or else on goodwill, in theory only, on cooperation and on willingness. We do not want a Community based on the arbitrary and the discretionary. We want a Community based on the rule of law. It is law that can guarantee those freedoms that Europeans enjoy today.\nI believe that this is an important point of principle and here I would like to make a personal observation. Three days ago, at the European University Institute in Florence, I gave a lecture, the Jean Monnet lecture, which focused precisely on my conception of law in the European Union. I believe that it is more necessary than ever to reaffirm those principles of a Community based on the rule of law that is our Community. That is what makes it different from other experiments at international level.\nWe make laws for a number of reasons: for example, to protect health by ensuring food safety, to protect the environment by setting standards for air and water quality and to lay down rules for businesses operating within the internal market, so as to enable them to fight on equal terms, avoiding all discrimination.\nWe make laws at European Union level because the Member States have agreed that certain measures should be determined at Community level. In practical terms, it is indeed a matter of substituting a single rule, applicable throughout the European Union, for 25 national rules. For all that, we have to ensure that European legislation and regulations give added value: they must be targeted, they must conform to the principles of subsidiarity and they must be correctly implemented, while at the same time being proportionate to the needs that they are intended to meet. The measures adopted must not be excessive nor go beyond what is strictly necessary. We must avoid rules that are too prescriptive, that lead to unwarranted expense, or that may turn out to be counter-productive.\nWe must also eliminate the cumulative effects of rules which, in time, end up overlapping with each other, an outcome that is detrimental to businesses, to the voluntary sector, to public authorities and to the citizens.\nAllow me, therefore, to congratulate the European Parliament on its excellent initiative to hold this debate on the topic of \u2018better lawmaking\u2019. It gives us the opportunity to examine this issue coherently. I wish to thank Mrs\u00a0Frassoni, Mr\u00a0Doorn, Mrs\u00a0McCarthy and Mr\u00a0Gargani, for whom Mr Lehne is standing in today, for their excellent work and for their reports.\nIn order to properly evaluate the quality of our legislative initiatives, we need a set of measures and a strong guiding principle. That is what clearly emerges from the various reports, which I believe provide a sound basis for our exchange of views today. These reports and the way in which we respond to them prove that our two institutions have come a long way in recent years. The need for better lawmaking and for laying down better rules is the subject of a genuine consensus. Our legislative activity is a continuous process. We must work together to ensure that our political choices, whatever they may be, are translated into legislation of the highest quality. Here, I would also like to congratulate the Austrian Presidency on all of the measures it has taken in this respect.\nHow do we perceive this challenge? We acknowledge it: we still need to make improvements to all the stages of the cycle, that is, from acts already adopted to new initiatives, via proposals currently under negotiation. That is why the Commission has launched a vast system for better lawmaking that combines several measures: a system designed to evaluate the impact of the Commission\u2019s important proposals; a programme designed to simplify the legislation in force and to withdraw a number of the Commission\u2019s proposals that are awaiting consideration by Parliament and the Council; and more frequent recourse to other ways of resolving problems aside from conventional legislation, for example, self-regulation by the parties concerned or coregulation by the legislator. All of these measures are now producing tangible results.\nLet us look at impact assessment. Since 2003, the Commission has put in place a system to look at the economic, social and environmental impact of all its major proposals. Since the adoption of an integrated approach, 120\u00a0impact assessments have been published. We have also updated our guidelines to help staff to better examine options and impacts, including on competitiveness, and to focus attention on issues such as the cost of too much paperwork. This reflects a marked and profound change in approach and attitude. I believe it is real progress. We know that as yet assessments do not all meet the same standards. We know there is room for improvement. We recognise, as pointed out in Mr Doorn\u2019s report on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, that quality can be improved and that quality control mechanisms must be strengthened.\nI fully subscribe to the need for a separate scrutiny of impact assessments; a kind of \u2018four eyes\u2019 principle. We are working on a comprehensive approach. First we need to ensure that our impact assessments are organised in the right way. As promised in March 2005, we are setting up a network of technical and scientific experts to help us develop methods of ensuring that impact assessments are comprehensive and of high quality. An external evaluation of the system is also under way, to identify where we are doing well and where we need to do better. Also, the authors of impact assessments need feedback to know if they have done a good job. That is why consultation is part and parcel of the impact assessment process. It is also one reason why all Commission impact assessments are on the Europa website.\nAs for quality control of the individual assessments, I agree that an independent check should be carried out independently of the services that propose legislation. I suggest that the best guarantee of impartiality is to put such a check under the authority of the President of the Commission. I have asked the Secretary-General of the Commission to examine how best to step up our quality support and control.\nBut let me stress that we need to work much more closely with you on impact assessment. I welcome the recent agreement on the common approach to impact assessment. This set of rules for dealing with impact assessment across all three institutions is an important step forward; it will facilitate our work together and avoid duplication of effort.\nMoving on to simplification, we have made a good start. The action programme, which we adopted last year, provides for the repeal, codification, recasting or modification of some 220\u00a0legal acts covering a wide range of policies. The programme, already under way in the automobile, waste and construction sectors, will be reviewed and updated in consultation with stakeholders. Other sectors such as foodstuffs, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and services will follow. We need your input to determine the right targets and to secure the best results.\nWe need the Council and Parliament to speed up the adoption of simplification proposals. My reading from your reports is that we basically agree on what we are trying to achieve. Now we have to get down to work, look at the substance and deliver results.\nWe are also tackling administrative burdens, which are particularly burdensome for small businesses. This means simplifying forms and modernising the customs code to assist electronic exchange of information. We are introducing the measurement of administrative costs in our impact assessments. It is essential that the Council and Parliament pay attention to the paperwork load when they suggest amendments.\nWe also need to test new approaches to regulation, looking at co-regulation and self-regulation as a possible alternative. We can work more closely with industry, for example, to deliver results on a voluntary basis.\nI understand very well your concerns about not being closely involved in the preparation of non-legislative approaches. Where such approaches seem the best route, I fully accept the need to work out ways of keeping Parliament involved in their preparation and implementation.\nFinally, I would like to say a word about the implementation of law. This is a high priority for the Commission. I ask you to look at the conclusions of our College meeting today. We analysed 2055 cases of infringements. That was the decision of the Commission today. Sometimes the decisions are very difficult and we expect some Member States to react. I hope you support the strong commitment of this Commission to the implementation and enforcement of Community law.\nOur laws need to be correctly applied and implemented, otherwise our efforts as policy- and lawmakers are in vain. As more and more policy areas mature, we should see a shift in political attention and resources towards implementation. In fact that is a great priority for this Commission. This whole programme of better regulation \u2013 including implementation \u2013 has become a flagship of this Commission. I am personally devoted to it, as are Vice-President Verheugen and the whole College. As the Commission we need to manage infringement proceedings efficiently. I am conscious of the need to reduce the timespan on individual infringement procedures. We need quicker ways to respond to the problems faced by citizens in business. We should look at these broad issues of implementation together and explore constructive ways of dealing with them. Later this year I expect the Commission to come back to you with specific suggestions.\nI believe that the reports discussed today show a shared analysis of what needs to be done. We have been putting the building blocks in place and now we have to deliver on our commitment. I am convinced that if we work in partnership we can show that Europe is not about red tape and unnecessary burdens but about delivering what citizens need in the right way. I believe that if we work in partnership we will reinforce a Community based on the principles of law.\n(Applause)", "lang": "EN", "original": "Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, President of the Commission . (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, European legislation is central to everything that makes the European Union special. We are, in fact, a Community based on the rule of law. Without law, we should have to rely on continual negotiation, on the balance of power between the Member States or else on goodwill, in theory only, on cooperation and on willingness. We do not want a Community based on the arbitrary and the discretionary. We want a Community based on the rule of law. It is law that can guarantee those freedoms that Europeans enjoy today.\nI believe that this is an important point of principle and here I would like to make a personal observation. Three days ago, at the European University Institute in Florence, I gave a lecture, the Jean Monnet lecture, which focused precisely on my conception of law in the European Union. I believe that it is more necessary than ever to reaffirm those principles of a Community based on the rule of law that is our Community. That is what makes it different from other experiments at international level.\nWe make laws for a number of reasons: for example, to protect health by ensuring food safety, to protect the environment by setting standards for air and water quality and to lay down rules for businesses operating within the internal market, so as to enable them to fight on equal terms, avoiding all discrimination.\nWe make laws at European Union level because the Member States have agreed that certain measures should be determined at Community level. In practical terms, it is indeed a matter of substituting a single rule, applicable throughout the European Union, for 25 national rules. For all that, we have to ensure that European legislation and regulations give added value: they must be targeted, they must conform to the principles of subsidiarity and they must be correctly implemented, while at the same time being proportionate to the needs that they are intended to meet.

On behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I have drafted an opinion on Mr Doorn\u2019s report. I should like to congratulate him on it and also thank him for including, virtually in their entirety, the various paragraphs that we in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, had incorporated in our opinion, based on our experience.\nI would also like to endorse what Mr Winkler said and respond by adding a slightly different slant, namely that better regulation does not always mean fewer rules and regulations or deregulation, but rather more effective regulation that is mainly geared towards the outcome and end result. This cycle of preparation, consultation, formulating rules, impact assessment and subsequently the implementation and enforcement has been mentioned by various people. In our opinion, I argued that we should, in fact, start at the back and look at the process from that angle. How can we make the process effective and based on that, what are the rules that we need to draft?\nA bad example of how this was not done, how this had not been given any thought and how the field dimension had not been drawn on at the preparation stage was the services directive which we discussed just now in its original form. Fortunately, this directive has now been changed by Parliament.\nI would also like to mention good examples from that selfsame Directorate-General market. Particularly in the area of the financial provision of services, a practice has been developed in that directorate and proposed by the Lamfalussy experts committee, which we call the Lamfalussy procedure. In this framework, it is indeed those who use the rules and regulations in practice, namely the supervisors, the economic operators, the consumers and users involved in the process, who should have far more say in terms of the content of those rules. We have also used this example to show others, and that is something we would like to make quite clear once again in this discussion.

Ik zou hem willen feliciteren met dit verslag en ook willen bedanken voor het vrijwel integraal opnemen van de verschillende paragrafen die wij, vanuit onze ervaringen in de Commissie economische zaken, in ons advies hadden opgenomen.\nIk zou me ook willen aansluiten bij woorden die de heer Winkler gesproken heeft, en met een lichte variant daarop willen zeggen: betere regelgeving is niet altijd minder regelgeving of deregulering, maar een effectievere regelgeving die vooral gericht is op het resultaat en op het eindresultaat. Die cyclus van voorbereiding, raadpleging, het formuleren van regels, de effectbeoordeling en vervolgens de tenuitvoerlegging en de handhaving is door verschillende mensen genoemd. In ons advies heb ik bepleit dat we juist ook aan de achterkant beginnen en het proces van daaruit bekijken. Hoe je het proces effectief kunt maken en van daaruit kijkt wat je dan aan regels moet opstellen.\nEen slecht voorbeeld van hoe dat niet gebeurd is, hoe daarover niet is nagedacht en hoe ook bij de voorbereiding het veld niet betrokken is geweest, was de dienstenrichtlijn die we net hiervoor in haar oorspronkelijke vorm besproken hebben.

In this respect, I think we are all convinced of the fact that better regulation is undoubtedly important for the world of business, but that it must also result at times in more legislation. That, Mr Barroso, is what Parliament told you very clearly, when your Commission was proposing to withdraw 68 proposals for texts and when, very clearly, in relation to Friendly Societies, we spoke of the need for legislation.\nOn behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I drafted an opinion on Mr Gargani\u2019s report, which focuses on simplifying the legislation and, in that regard, I should like to make three observations.\nFirstly, we must be mindful of the fact that, in this area, behind every technical question, there clearly lies a political question about content: what is it that we are simplifying? What acquis communautaire are we working on behind the simplification?\nSecondly, there are those who sometimes believe that better regulation is synonymous with self-regulation. Within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs we have, in the form of accounting standards, a perfect example of a situation where, in the absence of very specific democratic regulation, dangerous abuses can sometimes arise.\nFinally, the quest for simplification must also lead to the implementation of legislation that is better drawn up, whereby Parliament defines the principles and the rest is left to comitology. As you know, we fully support such an approach since it is based on a comitology agreement that fully recognises the rights of the co-legislator, that is to say the European Parliament, in the matter.", "lang": "FR", "original": "Pervenche Ber\u00e8s (PSE), rapporteur pour avis de la commission des affaires \u00e9conomiques et mon\u00e9taires . - Madame la Pr\u00e9sidente, Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident en exercice du Conseil, Messieurs les Commissaires, ce d\u00e9bat est essentiel. En fin de compte, il traite du monopole d\u2019initiative de la Commission en mati\u00e8re l\u00e9gislative. En effet, qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse de better regulation ou de law making , ce qui importe, c\u2019est la fa\u00e7on dont l\u2019initiative de la loi est prise.

I am delighted that a large part of my opinion has been included and that his report took up my own two objectives, which are, first of all, the emphasis given to the fact that simplification is necessary but must not be achieved in any old fashion, and secondly, the affirmation of Parliament\u2019s wish to participate fully in the simplification strategy. We can only welcome any initiative that aims to make the regulatory environment clearer and more coherent.\nIt is, in fact, impossible to continue working properly with an acquis of more than 80\u00a0000 pages. How, in these circumstances, can we talk to the citizens about accessibility and transparency with any credibility? That is why the simplification strategy must be supported in principle. It should enable us, in the long run, to have Community and national standards that are easier to apply and less costly. This simplification, however, also entails a number of limitations, indeed dangers, and we therefore need to be vigilant. In particular, this report specifies that simplification must not take the form of a lowering of standards, that there are problems linked to the application of the Interinstitutional Agreement governing the recasting procedure and that it is therefore necessary to clarify the applicable rules in order to avoid conflicts of competence and procedural obstacles. This report also clearly affirms Parliament\u2019s desire to fully participate in the simplification strategy and it puts the same emphasis on the need to protect Parliament\u2019s prerogatives as on the question of the adaptation of its rules of procedure. Simplification cannot, in fact, take place outside of all democratic control and, in particular, outside the control of Parliament.\nParliament must also give thought, within the context of simplification, to the improvement of its procedures and its internal legislative techniques. This issue will be the subject of a specific report that I am responsible for drafting. Finally, on the subject of alternative means of regulation, I am very pleased that this report demands a strict framework for recourse to coregulation and self-regulation, because it is essential to provide safeguards in this area.", "lang": "FR", "original": "Marie-Line Reynaud (PSE), rapporteur pour avis de la commission des affaires constitutionnelles . - Madame la Pr\u00e9sidente, je tiens \u00e0 remercier Monsieur Gargani pour la clart\u00e9 et l\u2019engagement de son rapport.

Comment, dans ces conditions, parler de mani\u00e8re cr\u00e9dible aux citoyens d\u2019accessibilit\u00e9 et de transparence?

Cependant, cette simplification comporte \u00e9galement un certain nombre de limites, voire de dangers, et il convient d\u00e8s lors de se monter vigilant. Ce rapport pr\u00e9cise notamment que la simplification ne doit pas se traduire par un abaissement des normes, qu\u2019il existe des probl\u00e8mes li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019application de l\u2019accord interinstitutionnel r\u00e9gissant la proc\u00e9dure de refonte et qu\u2019il est donc n\u00e9cessaire de clarifier les r\u00e8gles applicables pour \u00e9viter conflits de comp\u00e9tence et blocages proc\u00e9duraux. Ce rapport affirme \u00e9galement clairement la volont\u00e9 qu\u2019a le Parlement de prendre pleinement part \u00e0 la strat\u00e9gie de simplification et il met l\u2019accent tant sur la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de prot\u00e9ger les pr\u00e9rogatives du Parlement que sur la question de l\u2019adaptation de son r\u00e8glement int\u00e9rieur.

I have to admit that it is getting harder and harder for me to get any overview of this debate. There is often nothing visible behind the well-intentioned forms of words that we hear, and with which we are already familiar. I also sometimes suspect that this debate on better lawmaking is intended to distract us from our real functions as legislators and to serve as a pretext for inaction on the part of those who legislate for the Community or for better regulation meaning deregulation.\nThe whole thing has now got so baffling that one is tempted to call for a process of \u2018better regulation of the better regulation process\u2019 or for the impact of the impact assessment to be assessed. I am grateful to the rapporteurs for having worked out some very definite measures, albeit in amidst all this fog, particularly to Mrs Frassoni for her report with its concrete proposals for improved monitoring of the process of transposing Community law, for speedier infringement proceedings and greater transparency for those citizens who bring complaints.\nAfter all, it is not acceptable that members of the public should bring a complaint, or that the Commission should commence infringement proceedings, and then see the proceedings suddenly halted without the public being given any real information as to why this has happened. This often puts them in a worse position in pending cases at national level, and so rather more transparency is called for here.\nAbove all, I welcome the proposals that Mr Doorn has put together, especially those relating to impact assessment. We agree with him that the impact of acts of comitology needs to be assessed too, and with the idea that the impact assessment should be subject to independent review \u2013 independent, that is, of the relevant Directorate-General, but not necessarily conducted outside the Commission. The Commission has its political responsibility, and should not be required to surrender it; indeed, in this specific instance, it has no intention of really doing so.\nWe do not agree with Mr Doorn, though, on the question of mandatory impact assessments for amendments proposed in this House and in the Council. I do not think that we, as legislators, should, in this respect, allow ourselves to be shackled and silenced. A good impact assessment carried out by the Commission will also make it possible to gauge the effects of amendments, and there is also to hand the voluntary application of the impact assessment, of which \u2013 as we have heard \u2013 the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection has already availed itself, and that is something that should be discussed by the other committees too.\nWhat is true of better regulation is true of all other good intentions and of all the good things in this life: it is no good unless something is actually done about it, rather than it just being talked about.", "lang": "DE", "original": "Maria Berger, im Namen der PSE-Fraktion . \u2013 Frau Pr\u00e4sidentin, sehr geehrter Herr Kommissionspr\u00e4sident, sehr geehrte \u00f6sterreichische Ratspr\u00e4sidentschaft! Ich darf mich bei allen Berichterstatterinnen und Berichterstattern und bei den Verfasserinnen und Verfassern der Stellungnahmen sehr herzlich bedanken, auch daf\u00fcr, dass Sie alle einverstanden waren, heute eine gemeinsame Debatte dazu zu f\u00fchren.\nDiese gemeinsame Debatte erlaubt es uns, alle Aspekte zu sehen, die wir heute unter dem Stichwort better regulation bzw. better lawmaking zu debattieren haben. Ich muss eingestehen, dass diese Debatte f\u00fcr mich immer un\u00fcbersichtlicher wird. Hinter den gut gemeinten Formeln, die wir hier h\u00f6ren und schon oft geh\u00f6rt haben, ist h\u00e4ufig kein konkretes Substrat mehr erkennbar. Manchmal habe ich auch den Verdacht, dass uns diese Debatte \u00fcber die bessere Rechtsetzung von den tats\u00e4chlichen Aufgaben als Gesetzgeber ablenken soll und als Vorwand f\u00fcr ein Nichthandeln des Gemeinschaftsgesetzgebers dient bzw. daf\u00fcr, dass bessere Regulierung zur Deregulierung wird.\nDie Lage ist mittlerweile so un\u00fcbersichtlich, dass man versucht ist, nach einem Prozess zu rufen, der die better regulation of the better regulation process vorsieht bzw. eine Folgenabsch\u00e4tzung der Folgenabsch\u00e4tzung. Ich bin den Berichterstattern dankbar, dass sie \u2013 allerdings innerhalb all dieses Nebels \u2013 einige sehr konkrete Ma\u00dfnahmen herausgearbeitet haben. Das gilt insbesondere f\u00fcr den Bericht der Kollegin Frassoni und die konkreten Vorschl\u00e4ge f\u00fcr eine verbesserte Kontrolle der Umsetzung des Gemeinschaftsrechts, schnellere Vertragsverletzungsverfahren und eine gr\u00f6\u00dfere Transparenz f\u00fcr den beschwerdef\u00fchrenden B\u00fcrger.\nEs kann ja nicht sein, dass B\u00fcrger eine Beschwerde einleiten, die Kommission ein Vertragsverletzungsverfahren einleitet, das Verfahren dann pl\u00f6tzlich gestoppt wird und die B\u00fcrger nicht wirklich dar\u00fcber informiert werden, warum das Verfahren gestoppt wurde. Das verschlechtert oft ihre Rechtsposition bei anh\u00e4ngigen nationalen Verfahren. Hier ist einiges im Sinne der Transparenz notwendig.\nIch begr\u00fc\u00dfe vor allem die Vorschl\u00e4ge, die der Herr Kollege Doorn ausgearbeitet hat, insbesondere zur Folgenabsch\u00e4tzung. Wir teilen seine Meinung, dass auch Akte der Komitologie der Folgenabsch\u00e4tzung unterliegen sollten. Wir teilen auch die Idee, dass die Folgenabsch\u00e4tzung einer unabh\u00e4ngigen Pr\u00fcfung unterzogen werden sollte, die zwar unabh\u00e4ngig von der jeweils federf\u00fchrenden Generaldirektion sein sollte, aber nicht notwendigerweise au\u00dferhalb der Kommission erfolgen muss. Die Kommission hat ihre politische Verantwortung. Sie soll sie hier nicht abgeben, und im konkreten Fall will sie sie ja auch nicht wirklich abgeben.\nWo wir mit dem Herrn Kollegen Doorn nicht \u00fcbereinstimmen, ist in der Frage der verpflichtenden Folgenabsch\u00e4tzung f\u00fcr \u00c4nderungsantr\u00e4ge im Parlament und im Rat. Ich denke, wir d\u00fcrfen uns als Gesetzgeber hier nicht selbst Fesseln anlegen und uns entm\u00fcndigen. Eine gute Folgenabsch\u00e4tzung durch die Kommission wird es auch erlauben, Auswirkungen von \u00c4nderungen absch\u00e4tzen zu k\u00f6nnen. Es gibt zudem das Instrument der freiwilligen Anwendung der Folgenabsch\u00e4tzung, das \u2013 wie wir geh\u00f6rt haben \u2013 schon vom Ausschuss f\u00fcr Binnenmarkt und Verbraucherschutz eingesetzt wird. Das ist eine Sache, \u00fcber die wir auch in anderen Aussch\u00fcssen reden sollten.\nF\u00fcr die bessere Rechtsetzung gilt das gleiche wie f\u00fcr alle anderen guten Vors\u00e4tze und sch\u00f6nen Dinge im Leben: Es gibt nichts Gutes, au\u00dfer man tut es \u2013 und redet nicht nur dar\u00fcber.", "agenda_item": "Monitoring the application of Community law (2003-2004) - Better lawmaking 2004: application of the principle of subsidiarity - The implementation consequences and impact of the internal market legislation in force - Strategy for the simplification of the regulatory environment (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060404-ITEM-013", "intervention_id": "2-209", "summary_english": "```json\n{\n  \"headline\": \"Better Regulation Debate Risks Becoming Distraction from Real Legislative Functions Despite Some Concrete Proposals\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"The speaker raises concerns about the increasingly complex 'better regulation' debate, warning it could distract from real legislative functions and serve as a pretext for inaction.

That, however, is an obvious message.\nMr\u00a0Winkler, I was sorry to notice that you did not say a word on the subject of the implementation of the law, even though this subject concerns the Member States most of all. I also believe it would be interesting to hear the Council\u2019s views on the possibility of reopening the talks on the part of the better regulation agreement dealing with the implementation of the law, which failed miserably before.\nIn addition, on the matter of impact assessments, I do not hide my concerns, since this topic is becoming a kind of myth, a magic formula that in itself ought to make legislation better by basing it on scientific, impartial sources. I personally am sceptical on this point. Indeed, I am concerned that this topic is taking on too much importance, primarily because some of the proposals contained in the reports \u2013 particularly Mrs\u00a0McCarthy\u2019s but not only hers \u2013 introduce some bureaucratic elements that would be really complicated to administer, above all for the Commission. That seed of doubt has made my group realise how lucky we are that we have postponed the vote, because that will give us a chance to review the situation in order to reach an agreement.\nIn addition, those items that everyone is talking about that have been considered crucial in an impact assessment, including administrative costs, too much red tape and excessive costs for businesses, whether real or presumed, are in themselves a political choice. I shall give you an example, Mr\u00a0Barroso and Mr\u00a0Verheugen: a letter from UNICE was all it took to drastically cut back the air quality strategy, despite a EUR 2 million impact assessment that said that the costs to consider were not only the costs to businesses but also the costs to people\u2019s health. In the end, therefore, even impact assessments are political choices, and as a result I would ask you not to make them such a priority and so completely overstated compared with the other aspects of the law.\nI wish to say a final word about the issue of co-regulation and self-regulation. I should like the Commission to carry out a study to determine how well these procedures have worked because, according to our studies, they have not worked properly. The ability of businesses and companies to comply with these self-regulation agreements has been considered rather unsatisfactory by the companies themselves.", "lang": "IT", "original": "Monica Frassoni, a nome del gruppo Verts/ALE . \u2013 Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, innanzitutto vorrei dire al Presidente Barroso che ci\u00f2 che \u00e8 stato deciso oggi sull\u2019energia dimostra che quando volete, potete e quindi noi \u201cvorremmo\u201d che voi \u201cpoteste\u201d in un maggior numero di casi, in particolare per i temi della politica ambientale, dei consumatori e della salute; ma questo \u00e8 un messaggio ovvio.\nMinistro Winkler, ho notato con rammarico che lei non ha detto una parola sulla questione dell\u2019applicazione del diritto, sebbene questo tema riguardi soprattutto gli Stati membri. Credo inoltre che sarebbe interessante conoscere il parere del Consiglio rispetto alla possibilit\u00e0 di riaprire i negoziati sull\u2019accordo Better regulations per la parte relativa all\u2019applicazione del diritto, che in precedenza erano miseramente falliti.\nInoltre, per quanto riguarda la questione della valutazione d\u2019impatto, non nascondo le mie preoccupazioni, in quanto questo tema sta diventando una specie di mito, una parola magica che dovrebbe far diventare, di per s\u00e9, la legislazione migliore, basandola su fonti scientifiche e neutrali. Personalmente sono scettica rispetto a questo punto e, anzi, sono preoccupata per la portata che questo tema sta assumendo. Innanzitutto perch\u00e9 alcune delle proposte contenute nelle relazioni, in particolare quella dell\u2019onorevole McCarthy, ma non solo, introducono degli elementi di burocrazia veramente complicati da gestire, soprattutto per la Commissione. Questo costituisce un elemento di dubbio che fa dire al mio gruppo che \u00e8 una fortuna che abbiamo rinviato il voto, perch\u00e9 cos\u00ec avremo la possibilit\u00e0 di rivedere la situazione per trovare un accordo.\nInoltre gli elementi che sono ritenuti cardine, e di cui tutti parlano, per una valutazione di impatto, tra cui i costi amministrativi, l\u2019eccesso di burocrazia, l\u2019eccesso dei costi veri o presunti per le imprese, sono di per s\u00e9 una scelta politica. Un esempio, Presidente Barroso e Commissario Verheugen: \u00e8 stata sufficiente una lettera dell\u2019UNICE per ridimensionare drasticamente la strategia sull\u2019aria, nonostante un impact assessment costato due milioni di euro, nel quale si diceva che i costi non erano solamente quelli per le imprese, ma erano anche quelli per la salute. Quindi, alla fine, anche una valutazione di impatto \u00e8 una scelta di carattere politico e di conseguenza io inviterei a non renderla cos\u00ec prioritaria e completamente overstated rispetto agli altri elementi della legge.\nDesidero spendere un\u2019ultima parola sulla questione della coregolamentazione e dell\u2019autoregolamentazione. Vorrei che la Commissione facesse un\u2019analisi per stabilire come queste procedure abbiano funzionato perch\u00e9, secondo la nostra analisi, non hanno funzionato, in quanto la capacit\u00e0 delle imprese e delle aziende di conformarsi a questi accordi di autoregolamentazione \u00e8 stata ritenuta abbastanza insoddisfacente dalle aziende stesse.", "agenda_item": "Monitoring the application of Community law (2003-2004) - Better lawmaking 2004: application of the principle of subsidiarity - The implementation consequences and impact of the internal market legislation in force - Strategy for the simplification of the regulatory environment (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060404-ITEM-013", "intervention_id": "2-211", "summary_english": "```json\n{\n  \"headline\": \"Critical Assessment of Better Regulation Tools and Implementation Challenges in EU Lawmaking\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"The speaker raises concerns about the implementation of EU law by Member States, the overemphasis on impact assessments as a solution to better regulation, bureaucratic complexity in proposed legislative procedures, and the effectiveness of co-regulation and self-regulation mechanisms.\",\n  \"positionSum\": \"She is skeptical about impact assessments becoming a 'magic formula' for better legislation and believes they are being given excessive importance.

This creates the illusion that, particularly in the regulatory environment, more attention should be paid to subsidiarity in areas such as social protection, the environment and consumer protection. All of this fits into the neo-liberal way of thinking that fewer rules and regulations are, by definition, a good thing.\nReality, however, shows us that it is those very same European rules on the hallowed internal market that make life difficult for the European citizens. For example, it is those rules that require a small municipality in the north of the Netherlands to ask for permission from the European Commission before it can install a glass-fibre cable network for its own citizens, or that consider government support of the City of Amsterdam to the local zoo to be distortion of competition. No wonder the people of the Netherlands, having lost all faith in a further extension of Brussels powers and in the proposed Constitution which approved and backed this process, proceeded, by an overwhelming majority, to consign that document to the waste paper basket.\nReality is that subsidiarity has been an empty concept for a long time. European institutions, headed by this House, rarely, if ever, question whether European interference in a certain area actually makes a positive contribution to the wellbeing of people and the environment. On the contrary; a steady stream of European rules and regulations continues to undermine the authority of national and regional governments. One example I would give of that is the European services directive, which, even in its amended form, will seriously erode the autonomy of municipal authorities in the area of licences or the local provision of services.\nIn a nutshell, whilst a discussion on the quality and subsidiarity of European legislation is to be welcomed, it is totally na\u00efve to assume that by scrapping a handful of rules or carrying out impact assessments, the fundamental problems of interference from Brussels can be solved. For this to happen, the internal market rules will, in the first instance, need to be completely overhauled.", "lang": "NL", "original": "Erik Meijer, namens de GUE/NGL-Fractie . \u2013 Voorzitter, het is uiterst bedroevend dat er in de discussie over subsidiariteit en betere regelgeving maar \u00e9\u00e9n hoofdmotief lijkt te bestaan, namelijk grotere economische groei en meer concurrentie door middel van minder regelgeving. Daardoor wordt de illusie gewekt dat juist bij de regelgeving op het gebied van bijvoorbeeld sociale bescherming, milieu en consumentenbescherming meer moet worden gelet op subsidiariteit. Dit alles past in de neoliberale denkwijze dat minder regelgeving per definitie een goede zaak is.\nDe realiteit is echter dat het juist de Europese regels over de heilig verklaarde interne markt zijn die de Europese burgers in de weg zitten. Deze maken het bijvoorbeeld mogelijk dat een kleine gemeente in het noorden van Nederland van de Europese Commissie te horen krijgt dat ze eerst toestemming moet vragen voordat zij voor haar eigen burgers een glasvezelkabelnetwerk mag aanleggen. Of dat de overheidssteun van de stad Amsterdam aan de plaatselijke dierentuin vanuit Brussel als concurrentievervalsing wordt gezien. Geen wonder dat de Nederlandse burgers niets meer zien in verdere uitbreiding van Brusselse bevoegdheden en in de voorgestelde Grondwet die dat proces goedkeurde en ondersteunde. Zij hebben die tekst met een grote meerderheid naar de prullenmand verwezen.\nDe realiteit is dat subsidiariteit reeds lang tot een nietszeggend begrip is geworden. De Europese instellingen, dit Parlement voorop, stellen zich zelden of nooit de vraag of Europese bemoeienis met een bepaald onderwerp daadwerkelijk bijdraagt aan een beter welzijn van mens en milieu. Integendeel, nog altijd blijft een stroom van Europese regelgeving de zeggenschap van nationale en regionale overheden ondermijnen. Ik verwijs hier bijvoorbeeld naar de Europese dienstenrichtlijn, die ook in gewijzigde vorm de autonomie van gemeentelijke autoriteiten op het gebied van vergunningen of plaatselijke dienstverlening ernstig zal uithollen.\nSamengevat: het is goed dat er discussie is over de kwaliteit en subsidiariteit van de Europese regelgeving. Het is echter volstrekt na\u00efef te veronderstellen dat door het schrappen van een handvol regelgeving of het maken van effectbeoordelingen de fundamentele problemen van Brusselse bemoeienis kunnen worden opgelost.

At present we are debating the Commission\u2019s 21st and 22nd annual reports. In order to appreciate the scale of the problem, it should be pointed out that some four thousand infringement proceedings are involved. A so-called reasoned opinion has been issued for almost one thousand of these, and over 400 have been referred to the Court of Justice.\nIt is a matter of regret that the Commission was late in submitting the 22nd\u00a0annual report. This was only received in January\u00a02006 and consequently Parliament was only able to refer to part of the Commission\u2019s information for 2004 in its resolution. Paradoxically, it could be said that the more complaints, the better. This is because the complaints indicate that citizens of the Member States are playing an important role in the monitoring process and thus also in Union lawmaking. The citizens\u2019 complaints are not symbolic in nature. They are part of the process of building a citizens\u2019 Europe and in general they are an effective way of monitoring the application of Community law.\nThe European Parliament\u2019s committees should monitor the implementation of Community law closely, particularly in situations where the relevant rapporteur is required to participate actively in monitoring the application of a particular legal provision in individual Member States and also, naturally, when it comes to calling for immediate action should any infringements be noted.\nThe efficiency of the process should be improved by abbreviating the internal procedure, as was rightly included in the draft European Parliament resolution. It would also be appropriate to authorise individual Commissioners to exercise direct control over the transposition of Community provisions into national law within the stated periods of time.

I am in any case grateful for your understanding.\nI would like to say something, very briefly, about one or two of the issues that have been touched on in this debate. A very large number of speakers had something to say about the comitology issue. We have a saying in Austria to the effect that one should not cluck over eggs that have not yet been laid, but, under the Austrian Presidency, we have returned to the comitology issue with a great deal of commitment. We have already had two rounds of very detailed negotiation with your House\u2019s appointed representatives, the latter of which took place a couple of hours ago. After a number of years, I believe we are now on the right track towards finding a solution with which both the Council and Parliament can be satisfied.\nWhatever emerges will in any case be an improvement on the current situation, since it goes without saying that Parliament will have a say in those legislative acts that are adopted through the codecision procedure with its agreement and that of the Council. We are not far away from a solution, and I hope that we will arrive at finally sorting this out by the end of this period of six months. That will help improve our lawmaking processes.\nMrs Frassoni was, of course, quite right in what she had to say about the implementation of the law and its importance. This is a matter for the Member States rather than for the Council as such \u2013 on behalf of which I am of course speaking \u2013 but the individual Member States are of course endeavouring, in their discussions with the Commission, to find better ways of ensuring that the law is applied. We too \u2013 by which I mean \u2018we Austrians\u2019 \u2013 are of course just as much affected by this as any other Member State; infringement procedures have the same effect on us as on any of them. Speaking as a lawyer, I can say that every law does of course need machinery whereby it can be put into effect; that is important, and we are also endeavouring to pay more attention to the Commission and to find better ways of enforcing and applying the law.\nThe fact that what I said about this was not said in the name of the Council does not of course mean that the application and enforcement of the law are any less important than the legislative process itself.\nThe question of legislation and of the review of legislative acts already adopted is of course at the forefront of the Council\u2019s considerations.", "lang": "DE", "original": "Hans Winkler, amtierender Ratspr\u00e4sident .

The first, which we dealt with yesterday, was to do with transparency and the openness of the Council; the second is this debate on better regulation and legislation, and the last one we have this evening is on citizenship.

I will just read you the language. I think there is a communication problem here.

It is all true, but if you are sitting up there trying to listen to this, you are not necessarily going to understand what it means. Mr\u00a0Doorn, on better lawmaking, at paragraph 5, \u2018is of the opinion that the Lamfalussy procedure is a useful mechanism; regards the convergence of supervisory practices as crucial; welcomes the work of the Level 3 committees in this respect and supports the call for an adequate toolbox;\u2019 \u2013 great. Then, the McCarthy report \u2013 which I think is the clearest one \u2013 states in paragraph 6, \u2018requests that the Commission carry out both ex-ante and ex-post impact assessments on legislation to assist in identifying whether key policy objectives have been met\u00a0...\u2019, and the Gargani report has exactly the same. What I am trying to say is that we need better regulation, better lawmaking, but it is to do with simplification and us understanding what we are deciding on and people understanding what we are trying to decide on. That is what better regulation is all about; therefore, we need to use better language.

The first, which we dealt with yesterday, was to do with transparency and the openness of the Council; the second is this debate on better regulation and legislation, and the last one we have this evening is on citizenship. I support all those initiatives; I think they are great; I think the work that the Secretary-General is doing in the Commission under Mr\u00a0Ponzano is extremely good and I would like to recommend all four reports that have been put on the table today.\nHaving said that and given that we are talking about better regulation, when I started going through the reports, I got a bit uneasy. I will just read you the language. I think there is a communication problem here. Mrs\u00a0Frassoni drew up a great report, but paragraph 18, \u2018Notes that the SOLVIT network has proved its effectiveness in the internal market as a complementary non-judicial mechanism which has increased voluntary cooperation among Member States\u00a0...\u2019. It is all true, but if you are sitting up there trying to listen to this, you are not necessarily going to understand what it means. Mr\u00a0Doorn, on better lawmaking, at paragraph 5, \u2018is of the opinion that the Lamfalussy procedure is a useful mechanism; regards the convergence of supervisory practices as crucial; welcomes the work of the Level 3 committees in this respect and supports the call for an adequate toolbox;\u2019 \u2013 great. Then, the McCarthy report \u2013 which I think is the clearest one \u2013 states in paragraph 6, \u2018requests that the Commission carry out both ex-ante and ex-post impact assessments on legislation to assist in identifying whether key policy objectives have been met\u00a0...\u2019, and the Gargani report has exactly the same. What I am trying to say is that we need better regulation, better lawmaking, but it is to do with simplification and us understanding what we are deciding on and people understanding what we are trying to decide on. That is what better regulation is all about; therefore, we need to use better language.

In this regard, I wish to express my very strong reservations about certain mechanisms, including alternative regulatory mechanisms such as regulation and self-regulation. They have their place but, in the interest of the citizens and of consumers, I believe that they must not, under any circumstances, take the place of the law, which confers rights but also duties and therefore constitutes the most legitimate democratic tool.\nAs regards consultation prior to the legislative process, I call on the three institutions to organise, alongside the economic operators, the actual participation of the social partners and of civil society in all its diversity. It is, in fact, the responsibility of the public authorities to support the organisation of these players - consumer associations, public service users, associations fighting against exclusion or community education associations \u2013 throughout Europe.\nFinally, I should like to comment on the simplification rolling programme that is supposed to facilitate the Lisbon Strategy. I am surprised that it includes as its main principle the recasting of the regulation on organic farming, when even the producers in this sector are not asking for that, and that proposals as important as those on the status of the mutual benefit associations and of the European Association have, at the same time, been withdrawn from the legislative programme.", "lang": "FR", "original": "B\u00e9atrice Patrie (PSE). - Madame la Pr\u00e9sidente, Mesdames et Messieurs, sous l\u2019aspect d\u2019un d\u00e9bat technique, se cache ici un d\u00e9bat d\u2019une grande importance politique.

There are many more examples.\nThirdly, this slimming diet that we want and that the SMEs, in particular, also want is not a casual, non-interventionist diet.

The actual quantity of EU legislation must also be debated. The fact is that the number of EU laws has risen dramatically in recent years, and the EU is now legislating in a host of new areas. At the same time, it is extremely unusual for the EU to give its right of decision-making back to Member States or to repeal legislation. The combination of a very large quantity of legislation and the deficient quality of such legislation makes for a lack of clarity and makes it difficult to implement legislation in practice.\nWhere quality is concerned, there is a lot that can now already be done, and the reports contain proposals for doing these things. Out-of-date legislation can be repealed. Other legislation can be simplified, and some can be merged and consolidated. All that is fine, but another way of approaching legislative work is also required. In determining the direction to be taken by legislation, we need to focus more on objectives and less on detail, and we need to give the Member States greater freedom to choose how they are to pursue the objectives set.\nImpact analyses are fine, but it is not always so easy to measure what we want to measure. More often than not, it is simpler to measure straightforward economic factors than, for example, environmental factors. We had this debate in connection with the debate on the chemicals policy, REACH. It was easy to measure a company\u2019s costs, but difficult to measure the huge benefits in terms of public health and reduced human suffering of there being fewer diseases. This means that there is a need to be rather careful in this area.\nIf there is a real desire to simplify matters, the number of EU laws must be reduced, and the area that is absolutely the most overregulated is agricultural policy, where most matters could be returned to Member State level and thousands of laws could be abolished. A number of speakers refer to the European Constitution. The fact is, it would have made these problems worse by increasing the EU\u2019s power and making it easier for the EU to appropriate new legislative powers and to be able to legislate in areas in which it really ought not to get involved.

Well, I sometimes wonder whether we do not, in fact, draw our inspiration from this ancient Japanese legislation.\nIn reality, ladies and gentlemen, I think that the complexity of European law is the perverse effect of a group dynamic to which we are all party. What is it all about? Firstly, the initiative rests with the Commission, but behind every Commissioner, there is, of course, the general management and the officials who are part of it. Next, it passes to the Council. In theory, the Council is composed of ministers. They reach agreement on a text, provided that each of their respective bureaucracies recognises in it all of the standards that are to feature in the joint text, then the text is passed to Parliament and Parliament appoints a rapporteur. Naturally, the rapporteur, as is perfectly legitimate, wants his name to go down in history. His name is much more likely to be remembered if he adds standards rather than removes them, and that is without mentioning the Members who table amendments, the important role of lobbies and so on. Thus it is, ladies and gentlemen, that we arrive at a real regulatory monster.\nI have been in this Parliament for 17 years and, right from the very first year of my taking up my seat here, there was already a debate being held on the simplification of European Community law. I have the impression that we are no farther forward with this than we were 17 years ago, the only difference being that the situation has got even worse.\nWhat is to be done then? We have to agree on the meaning of the terms used. We need a proper dictionary of Community law, a code like the Civil Code, or the Commercial Code or the Penal Code, which is organised rationally and divided into parts, sub-parts, chapters, sections and articles, in such a way that, when we are working on a text, we know in advance that we are going to amend such and such an article. In short, we need to make a great effort towards simplification. I fear that, despite the good intentions expressed by the rapporteurs, we are not quite there yet.

Et, naturellement, le rapporteur - c\u2019est bien l\u00e9gitime - veut laisser son nom dans l\u2019histoire. Or il laissera bien davantage un nom s\u2019il ajoute des normes plut\u00f4t que s\u2019il en supprime, sans parler des coll\u00e8gues qui d\u00e9posent des amendements, du r\u00f4le important des lobbies, etc. C\u2019est ainsi, Mesdames et Messieurs, que nous arrivons \u00e0 un v\u00e9ritable monstre normatif.\nCela fait dix-sept ans que je suis dans ce Parlement et, d\u00e8s la premi\u00e8re ann\u00e9e o\u00f9 j\u2019ai si\u00e9g\u00e9 ici un d\u00e9bat sur la simplification du droit communautaire se tenait d\u00e9j\u00e0.

Indeed, I also believe that, with the European Constitution, we would be in a very much better position in the field of normative lawmaking than is presently the case. I am glad that we are pulling together on this.\nI believe that we should always bear in mind with regard to better lawmaking that the aim of all these reports on the subject is not, of course, to improve the familiarity of the individual citizen with the legal texts, but to provide Member States with a simple text to help with transposition. Therefore, we need to keep our objective clearly in mind when faced with these challenges.\nNaturally, in this particular context \u2013 and I do not mean to be ironic in any way when I say that I have to expressly agree with the previous speaker for once on this particular point \u2013 we complain that our legislative process is not at all transparent in the field of comitology. This legislative process has been criticised in this House from time to time.\nFor this reason, I am convinced that we need external scrutiny of European legislation, and that this cannot just be carried out by the Commission itself. The question arises whether this could be carried out by an agency \u2013 and you are all aware of our reservations about the creation of further agencies: \u2018no increase in bureaucracy to reduce bureaucracy\u2019 \u2013 or by other external authorities.

On this basis, I believe that the greatest danger to democracy at the moment is the technocracy associated with economic interests \u2014 what is known as self-regulation or co-regulation \u2014 which is a way to put general interests into the hands of the individual interests of the few, and that is something we should remember.\nI myself, having been elected to many terms in office, would not be prepared to renounce my legislative responsibilities in favour of sub-contracting and in favour of technocratic interests.", "lang": "ES", "original": "Manuel Medina Ortega (PSE). \u2013 (ES) Se\u00f1or Presidente, hubo una \u00e9poca en la que las leyes las hac\u00edan los dioses; los dioses hac\u00edan leyes perfectas.

If we wish, however, to retain the public\u2019s faith in the single market, we must stem the outflow of investment and the loss of jobs. This means that we must not only reduce and simplify legislation, but we must also, in my opinion, reconsider the original aims of both European and national regulation. This is a serious political challenge. It is also up to us, ladies and gentlemen, to demand that every single measure, whether aimed at, for example, protecting health or the environment, is subjected to an impact assessment. Mrs\u00a0McCarthy is requesting this in the report of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection . I would add that it must be made clear what costs will be borne by European producers, by how much public finances will be increased or depleted and what will be the effect on unemployment in our regions. In particular we should know in advance how regulations aimed at improving standards will affect the competitiveness of European products vis-\u00e0-vis third countries, so as to ensure that the main outcome is not the further migration of plant and capital away from Europe.\nBetter regulation also means that, in the context of costs, we will investigate seriously whether the new measures might really improve the health or social conditions of our citizens, or whether this is merely an unfounded assumption. Both as a doctor and as a politician I do not like it that so many European and national regulations are merely populist gestures. Against that, I have no clear ideas on how to protect consumers against the harmful or counterfeit products from third countries that are displacing quality European products. An example of this might be the children\u2019s footwear from Asia that has orthopaedic defects. The only solution to this would be a mandatory new health certificate for children\u2019s footwear, which would also be better regulation for the public.\nI am sorry that the Commission is being so slow to codify consumer protection and the protection of intellectual property. Never before has the standard of European regulation been as important as it is today, when the Union faces serious competition from third countries. The political aim of today\u2019s regulation is to safeguard both fair competition and the European consumer \u2013 not only inside but also outside Europe \u2013 and also to motivate the creativity of our citizens while ridding them of ineffective regulation.", "lang": "CS", "original": "Zuzana Roithov\u00e1 (PPE-DE). \u2013 D\u00e1my a p\u00e1nov\u00e9, jsem si v\u011bdoma, \u017ee nov\u00fd p\u0159\u00edstup k evropsk\u00e9 regulaci vy\u017eaduje zm\u011bnu my\u0161len\u00ed, mo\u017en\u00e1 i smluv.

In my opinion, it has absolutely nothing to do with democracy being replaced with technocracy. That is not what this is about. It goes without saying that the democratic institutions are still in control. The Commission makes decisions on proposals on its own responsibility, as, of course, do Parliament and the Council.\nThis matter hinges on a vital point, namely that we are changing the procedures governing our support. Currently, the EU makes legislation on the basis of \u2018learning by doing\u2019. We decide on something, and something comes out of it in the end that has some effect or other. If we subsequently discover that the effect is undesirable, we have the problem that, thanks to the EU\u2019s complex procedures, we cannot just quickly amend these laws, as national parliaments do, but need a complex procedure lasting many years to revise directives and amend regulations. Thus, different mechanisms are needed from those often existing at national level.\nWe need to know what we are doing. What regulatory impact assessments do is give us support; we are informed of the consequences our actions will have by independent people, too. Even though, ultimately, the political decision remains ours to take, we still need this support. That is quite crucial when the Commission, the Council and Parliament have to take decisions on behalf of 470\u00a0million people in such a large economic area. For that reason, too, it is vital to have an independent element.\nI would appeal quite clearly once more to the Commission to work to ensure the introduction of this independent element within its own structures, too. If it does not, Parliament \u2013 if it takes itself seriously \u2013 will be forced to conduct its own independent impact assessments in each case.

It is not about less legislation, nor about worse legislation. It is not about deregulation, nor about neoliberal free-market radicalism. It is purely and simply about shaping the European legal system such as to make it understandable to the public, and such that the European economy can use it for growth, investment and job creation. It is really the simplest thing in the world, and I am astonished time and again at the kind of motives being attributed to such a clear, unambiguous concept.\nWhether or not we believe that we have too many European laws or that these may not always be good enough is irrelevant. We are not talking about a matter of belief, but about an alarmingly large proportion of the European public being convinced that that is the case. We are talking about European entrepreneurs and trade unions unanimously saying that that is the case. Too much bureaucracy, too many laws, overly complicated laws, too many unnecessary restrictions. It does not matter if this is really the case; what matters is that those for whom we make the laws are convinced that it is. That is why we had to do something.\nThe \u2018better lawmaking\u2019 exercise proposed by the Commission uses all the instruments that have been mentioned here \u2013 various ways of simplifying and modernising legislation without changing its content. To reiterate: the important thing is not to change the substance of regulations, but to make them user friendly and transparent.\nI would once more solicit Parliament\u2019s support. In reality, of course, we are concerned here with two large projects, two different projects, one of which is the retroactive screening of the whole corpus of legislation.\nLet us not fool ourselves, however. When European integration was still in its infancy, the attitude towards the adoption of legislation was quite different from that which prevails today, and, going back a little further, astonishing things are to be found in the annals of our statute books. No one is denying that modernisation is needed there. The screening of the whole corpus is no simple matter, and I should be very much in favour of our agreeing on common procedures for this, too, and not just with regard to codification, where this has already been done.\nA separate issue is how to make regulations or laws in future. The issue of impact assessments plays a quite fundamental role in this connection. I agree with all of you here who have said that it is essential in a democracy that the legislature knows the consequences its action will have for those affected. Of course, that does not mean that the legislature will refrain from acting once in possession of that knowledge. It will always be a matter of judgment.\nIf the Commission were to say that a piece of legislation would incur costs to the economy of EUR\u00a0X\u00a0billion but that, on the other hand, this legislation had to be presented in order to meet the public\u2019s need for health protection, the decision would not be a difficult one. The Commission would then say that the protection of public health takes precedence, even if it costs money.\nI should like to make it clear here that impact assessments do not automatically mean that, should it emerge that one of our actions also incurs costs, we simply say: we shall not do it. It is a case of knowing exactly what we are doing.\nSome important thoughts have been expressed here on the issue of how best to organise such impact assessments, and I can tell you quite frankly that a discussion on this issue is currently under way in the Commission, and both President\u00a0Barroso and myself are truly of the opinion that the current system needs to be changed.\nI wholeheartedly agree with those of you here who have said that the final decision on the validity of an impact assessment cannot lie with those who performed it, and that work on an impact assessment cannot be carried out exclusively by those making the law associated with it. That is exactly the way President\u00a0Barroso and I see it. We are discussing the best possible solution. Indeed, in his introductory statement, the President said that he is considering establishing an independent authority under his own responsibility for screening impact assessments. We are ready and willing to continue our dialogue with Parliament, therefore. The same goes for the comitology procedure, in which, indeed, we largely endorse Parliament\u2019s requests, and also for all the other ideas that have been expressed here.\nI should just like to impress upon you once more that this exercise should not be dealt with in a technical, bureaucratic or formalistic way. It is truly a highly political exercise. It is intended to help reinforce public confidence in the system of European integration as a whole, and to help provide our economy with a stable, reliable framework, so as to resolve the great social issue of our time, namely that of the future of our jobs.", "lang": "DE", "original": "G\u00fcnter Verheugen, Vizepr\u00e4sident der Kommission . Frau Pr\u00e4sidentin, meine sehr verehrten Damen und Herren! Lassen Sie mich bitte noch einmal versuchen zu erkl\u00e4ren, worum es geht und worum es nicht geht. Es geht nicht um weniger Gesetzgebung. Es geht nicht um schlechtere Gesetzgebung, es geht nicht um Deregulierung, es geht nicht um neoliberalen Marktradikalismus. Es geht schlicht und einfach darum, das europ\u00e4ische Rechtssystem so zu gestalten, dass die B\u00fcrgerinnen und B\u00fcrger es verstehen k\u00f6nnen, und es so zu gestalten, dass die europ\u00e4ische Wirtschaft es benutzen kann, um zu wachsen, zu investieren und Arbeitspl\u00e4tze zu schaffen. Es ist wirklich das Einfachste von der Welt, und ich bin immer wieder erstaunt, was f\u00fcr Motive hinter einem so eindeutigen und klaren Konzept auch vermutet werden k\u00f6nnen.\nOb wir glauben oder nicht, dass wir zu viele europ\u00e4ische Gesetze haben und dass sie vielleicht auch nicht immer gut genug sind, spielt \u00fcberhaupt keine Rolle. Es ist keine Glaubensfrage, \u00fcber die wir hier sprechen, sondern wir sprechen dar\u00fcber, dass ein erschreckend hoher Anteil der B\u00fcrgerinnen und B\u00fcrger Europas davon \u00fcberzeugt ist, dass es so ist. Wir sprechen davon, dass die europ\u00e4ischen Unternehmerinnen und Unternehmer und die europ\u00e4ischen Gewerkschaften \u00fcbereinstimmend davon sprechen, dass es so ist. Zu viel B\u00fcrokratie, zu viele Gesetze, zu komplizierte Gesetze, zu viele unn\u00f6tige Einschr\u00e4nkungen. Es kommt nicht darauf an, ob es wirklich so ist, es kommt darauf an, dass diejenigen, f\u00fcr die wir die Gesetze machen, davon \u00fcberzeugt sind, dass es so ist. Deshalb war es notwendig, etwas zu tun.\nDas von der Kommission vorgeschlagene Projekt \u201eBessere Rechtsetzung\u201c arbeitet mit all den Instrumenten, die hier genannt worden sind \u2013 verschiedene Formen, in denen man das Recht vereinfachen und modernisieren kann, ohne es in seinem Gehalt zu ver\u00e4ndern. Ich muss es noch einmal sagen: Es geht nicht darum, die Substanz von Regelungen zu ver\u00e4ndern, sondern es geht darum, sie benutzerfreundlich und transparent zu machen.\nIch werbe noch einmal um die Unterst\u00fctzung des Europ\u00e4ischen Parlaments. Es sind in Wahrheit ja zwei gro\u00dfe, zwei verschiedene Projekte. Das eine Projekt ist die r\u00fcckwirkende \u00dcberpr\u00fcfung des gesamten Rechtsbestandes.\nMachen wir uns doch nichts vor! Als die europ\u00e4ische Integration noch jung war, wurden Gesetze unter anderen Gesichtspunkten gemacht als heute, und wenn wir etwas weiter zur\u00fcckgehen, finden wir in den Annalen unserer Gesetzesb\u00fccher schon sehr erstaunliche Dinge. Kein Mensch bestreitet, dass das modernisiert werden muss. Die \u00dcberpr\u00fcfung des gesamten Bestandes ist keine einfache Sache, und ich w\u00e4re sehr daf\u00fcr, dass wir uns auch hier auf gemeinsame Verfahren einigen und nicht nur bei der Kodifizierung, wo wir das bereits getan haben.\nDavon zu unterscheiden ist die Frage: Wie wollen wir in Zukunft Regelungen treffen? Wie wollen wir in Zukunft Gesetze machen? In diesem Zusammenhang spielt die Frage der Folgenabsch\u00e4tzung eine ganz zentrale Rolle. Ich unterst\u00fctze all diejenigen hier, die sagen: Es ist in einer Demokratie zwingend, dass der Gesetzgeber wei\u00df, welche Folgen sein Handeln f\u00fcr die Betroffenen hat. Das bedeutet ja nicht, dass der Gesetzgeber darauf verzichtet, etwas zu tun, wenn er das wei\u00df. Es wird immer eine Frage der Abw\u00e4gung sein.\nWenn die Kommission Ihnen sagt, eine Gesetzgebung verursacht f\u00fcr die Wirtschaft Kosten von x Milliarden Euro, Ihnen auf der anderen Seite aber sagt, dass es notwendig sei, diese Gesetzgebung vorzulegen, um den Bed\u00fcrfnissen der B\u00fcrgerinnen und B\u00fcrger nach Schutz ihrer Gesundheit nachzukommen, f\u00e4llt die Abw\u00e4gung nicht schwer. Die Kommission wird dann sagen: Der Schutz der Gesundheit der B\u00fcrgerinnen und B\u00fcrger geht vor, auch wenn es etwas kostet.\nIch m\u00f6chte hier klar machen, dass Folgenabsch\u00e4tzung nicht automatisch bedeutet, dass wir dann, wenn sich herausstellt, dass wir etwas tun, was auch Kosten verursacht, einfach sagen: Wir tun es nicht. Es geht darum, dass wir ganz genau wissen, was wir tun.\nHier sind wichtige Gedanken zu der Frage ge\u00e4u\u00dfert worden, wie eine solche Folgenabsch\u00e4tzung am besten organisiert wird, und ich sage Ihnen in aller Offenheit: Wir sind, was diese Frage betrifft, in der Kommission mitten in einem Diskussionsprozess, und sowohl Pr\u00e4sident Barroso als auch ich sind wirklich der Meinung, dass wir das jetzige System ver\u00e4ndern m\u00fcssen.\nIch teile voll und ganz die Auffassung derjenigen, die hier gesagt haben: Es kann die endg\u00fcltige Entscheidung \u00fcber die G\u00fcltigkeit einer Folgenabsch\u00e4tzung nicht bei denjenigen liegen, die sie gemacht haben, und es k\u00f6nnen nicht ausschlie\u00dflich diejenigen mit einer Folgenabsch\u00e4tzung befasst sein, die das dazugeh\u00f6rige Gesetz machen. Das sehen Pr\u00e4sident Barroso und ich ganz genau so. Wir diskutieren \u00fcber die bestm\u00f6gliche L\u00f6sung. Der Pr\u00e4sident hat in seinem einf\u00fchrenden Statement ja gesagt, dass er daran denkt, eine unabh\u00e4ngige Stelle unter seiner eigenen Verantwortung einzurichten, die die Folgenabsch\u00e4tzung \u00fcberpr\u00fcft. Wir sind also gerne bereit, mit dem Parlament weiter zu reden. Dasselbe gilt f\u00fcr das Komitologieverfahren, wo wir ja die Anliegen des Parlaments weitgehend unterst\u00fctzen, und auch f\u00fcr alle anderen Anregungen, die hier eingebracht worden sind.\nIch m\u00f6chte Ihnen nur noch einmal nahe bringen, dass es sich hier um ein Projekt handelt, das wir nicht technisch oder b\u00fcrokratisch oder formalistisch behandeln d\u00fcrfen. Es ist ein hochpolitisches Projekt, hochpolitisch! Es soll dazu beitragen, das Vertrauen der B\u00fcrgerinnen und B\u00fcrger in das Gesamtsystem der europ\u00e4ischen Integration zu st\u00e4rken, und es soll dazu beitragen, unserer Wirtschaft stabile und verl\u00e4ssliche Rahmenbedingungen zu geben, damit die gro\u00dfe soziale Frage unserer Zeit gel\u00f6st wird, n\u00e4mlich die Frage nach der Zukunft unserer Arbeitspl\u00e4tze.", "agenda_item": "Monitoring the application of Community law (2003-2004) - Better lawmaking 2004: application of the principle of subsidiarity - The implementation consequences and impact of the internal market legislation in force - Strategy for the simplification of the regulatory environment (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060404-ITEM-013", "intervention_id": "2-233", "summary_english": "```json\n{\n  \"headline\": \"Vice-President Verheugen Defends Commission's Better Lawmaking Initiative as Political Exercise to Restore Public Confidence\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"The speaker addresses concerns about European legislation being perceived as too bureaucratic, complicated, and numerous by the public, entrepreneurs, and trade unions.

This loophole was filled by the draft Constitution.

Debate Information\n\n**Topic:** Monitoring the application of Community law (2003-2004) - Better lawmaking 2004: application of the principle of subsidiarity - The implementation consequences and impact of the internal market legislation in force - Strategy for the simplification of the regulatory environment\n\n**Number of Contributions:** 44 speakers participated in this comprehensive debate on EU regulatory reform\n\n**Focus Areas:** The debate covered multiple interconnected aspects of EU lawmaking including better regulation, subsidiarity, impact assessment, legislative simplification, enforcement mechanisms, and stakeholder consultation.\n\n## 2. Executive Summary\n\n### Core Issues Identified\n\nThe debate revealed widespread consensus that EU lawmaking faces serious structural problems. **Monica Frassoni** highlighted enforcement deficiencies, noting \"there are two conflicting schools of thought in the Commission - one that avoids problems with member states and another that applies rules positively and rapidly.\" **Bert Doorn** emphasized transparency concerns, stating \"you don't see them, you don't hear them, some 450 consultation clubs in Brussels continuously make decisions that affect citizens' daily lives.\"\n\n**Arlene McCarthy** stressed the connection between legal quality and public confidence: \"The confidence and trust of citizens, consumers and business in the EU itself is linked to their experience and perception of EU laws and the impact they have on their daily lives.\"\n\n### Impact Assessment Debate\n\nA central controversy emerged around impact assessment methodology. **Klaus-Heiner Lehne** argued for independence: \"Officials who draft proposals cannot be solely responsible for impact assessment, because the consequence is that this assessment becomes nothing more than part of the justification.\" However, **Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso** supported maintaining Commission control while establishing independent quality control under presidential authority.\n\n**Diana Wallis** warned against technocratic overreach: \"Impact assessment cannot displace political decision making. Give us all the information in a balanced manner, then, in full transparency, we can make a political decision for which we are accountable.\"\n\n### Subsidiarity and Democratic Legitimacy\n\n**Alyn Smith** advocated extending subsidiarity beyond member states: \"the EU view of subsidiarity too often stops at the Member State when, in fact, the more relevant partner may well be much more local.\" **Manuel Medina Ortega** defended parliamentary primacy: \"the only criterion for knowing if a law is good or bad is democracy, the criterion of the majority.\"\n\n**Erik Meijer** criticized current internal market rules as the real problem: \"The reality is that it is precisely the European rules on the sacred internal market that are in the way of European citizens.\"\n\n### Implementation and Enforcement\n\n**Andrzej Jan Szejna** warned of system credibility risks: \"If European law is not perceived as binding for everyone, and its transposition and implementation depend only on the goodwill of the government, this may lead to objective renationalization of Community policy.\"\n\n**Hans Winkler**, representing the Austrian Council Presidency, outlined comprehensive reform proposals including quantitative targets for administrative burden reduction and improved stakeholder consultation processes.\n\n### Language and Accessibility\n\n**Alexander Stubb** emphasized communication challenges: \"What I am trying to say is that we need better regulation, better lawmaking, but it is to do with simplification and us understanding what we are deciding on and people understanding what we are trying to decide on.\"\n\n**Bruno Gollnisch** described EU law as creating \"a true normative monster\" and proposed comprehensive legal codification similar to civil law systems.\n\n### Regulatory Philosophy\n\nThe debate revealed fundamental philosophical divisions. **G\u00fcnter Verheugen** defended the Better Lawmaking initiative: \"It is simply about designing the European legal system so that citizens can understand it, and designing it so that the European economy can use it to grow, invest and create jobs.\"\n\nConversely, **Jonas Sj\u00f6stedt** advocated for substantial deregulation: \"We need less detailed control, more goal-oriented legislation and greater freedom for member states to choose how they implement the goals that are established.\"\n\n### Key Proposals\n\nMultiple speakers supported establishing independent expert panels for impact assessment review, with **Johannes Blokland** emphasizing true independence from institutional representatives. **Marie-Line Reynaud** insisted that \"simplification cannot occur outside democratic control and, in particular, outside Parliamentary oversight.\"\n\n**Brian Crowley** proposed involving practicing politicians rather than just technocrats in working groups, arguing they \"understand how this must be sold to the public and enforced at a local level.\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe debate demonstrated broad agreement on the need for EU regulatory reform but significant disagreement on methods and scope. While there was consensus on improving transparency, simplification, and impact assessment, fundamental tensions remained between those favoring technocratic efficiency and those defending democratic legitimacy, between advocates of deregulation and defenders of regulatory standards, and between those supporting centralization and those promoting subsidiarity. The challenge ahead lies in reconciling these competing visions while maintaining the integrity of the EU legal system and public confidence in European institutions.", "src_model": "claude", "model_type": "claude", "model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "structured": true, "incremental": false, "hierarchical": false, "grouped": false, "shuffle": false, "prompt": false, "lang": "original"}
