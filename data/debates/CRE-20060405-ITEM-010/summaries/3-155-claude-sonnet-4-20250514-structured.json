{"speaker": "Francis Wurtz,", "english": "Francis Wurtz, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group . \u2013 (FR) Mr\u00a0President, Mrs\u00a0Ferrero-Waldner, Mr\u00a0Solana, those with a sound knowledge of Israeli society assure us, in the wake of the elections, that the majority of the country\u2019s population are now resolved to accept, willingly or not, the idea that the occupation of the Palestinian territories is, in every respect, a deadlock that needs to be broken.\nUnfortunately, the new Prime Minister is pursuing his predecessor\u2019s strategy, namely unilateral separation on the basis of faits accomplis precluding the construction of a viable Palestinian State, on the one hand, and, for the time being, the oppression of the Palestinian people in an attempt to make them capitulate, on the other. This policy is irresponsible.\nYesterday, the major Israeli daily, Haaretz , quoted the United Nations in its headline \u2018Gaza is on the brink of disaster\u2019. In Nablus, in the West Bank, young people under the age of 30 are no longer allowed to leave their town! Kalandia, in the heart of the Palestinian Territory, has just been turned into a border terminal! East Jerusalem is surrounded! What is the meaning, then, of the proposal to negotiate with the Head of the Palestinian Authority whom, I might add, people are making every effort to discredit, as was the case during the recent coup de force in Jericho?\nIn this context, it is almost moving to see new peace initiatives emerge from Palestinian and Israeli society, such as that of the combatants for peace, which is due to be officially launched on Monday. This initiative involves former officers of the Israeli army, who have joined forces with former combatants from Palestine and drawn from their respective experiences the common belief that the solution to the region\u2019s problems can only be political and based on the relevant United Nations resolutions from 1967 onwards.\nWe all pay tribute to the clear-sightedness and the courage of these women and men. What do they expect of the European Union, though? Aid alone is not enough: every nation needs freedom just as much as it needs bread. The fact remains that, by causing the collapse of the last remnants of Palestine\u2019s social, administrative and security structures, the withdrawal of aid, even on a partial and temporary basis, would rule out any hope of just peace for a long time yet.\nMore generally, what political role should Europe now play? Mr\u00a0Solana just mentioned the Venice European Council in 1980, which is a good point of reference. A quarter of a century has, in fact, gone by since another key moment in the history of the Middle East, when we were able to assume our responsibilities. We had, at that time, officially recognised the PLO and adopted the \u2018two peoples, two states\u2019 principle. In my view, the current situation calls for a further strong act on the part of Europe. That act must be aimed at providing new and clear reference points leading to an outlook based on law and at restoring hope among the peace-keeping forces throughout the region. It was in this spirit that I proposed the idea of making our own institution act as a catalyst: it could decide to hold its Conference of Presidents in East Jerusalem with the aim of sending a real message of peace to all of the key figures there.", "lang": "FR", "original": "Francis Wurtz, au nom du groupe GUE/NGL . - Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, Madame la Commissaire, Monsieur Solana, de bons connaisseurs de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 isra\u00e9lienne nous assurent, au lendemain des \u00e9lections, que la majorit\u00e9 de la population du pays est aujourd\u2019hui r\u00e9solue \u00e0 accepter, bon gr\u00e9 mal gr\u00e9, l\u2019id\u00e9e que l\u2019occupation des territoires palestiniens est \u00e0 tous \u00e9gards une impasse dont il faut sortir.\nMalheureusement, le nouveau Premier ministre poursuit la strat\u00e9gie de son pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseur, \u00e0 savoir, d\u2019une part, la s\u00e9paration unilat\u00e9rale sur la base de faits accomplis rendant impossible l\u2019\u00e9dification d\u2019un \u00c9tat palestinien viable et, d\u2019autre part, dans l\u2019imm\u00e9diat, l\u2019asphyxie du peuple palestinien pour tenter de le faire capituler. Cette politique est irresponsable.\nHier, le grand quotidien isra\u00e9lien Haaretz titrait, citant les Nations unies, \u00abGaza est au bord du d\u00e9sastre\u00bb. \u00c0 Naplouse en Cisjordanie, les jeunes de moins de trente\u00a0ans n\u2019ont plus le droit de quitter leur ville! Kalandia, en plein territoire palestinien, vient d\u2019\u00eatre transform\u00e9e en fronti\u00e8re! J\u00e9rusalem-Est est encercl\u00e9e! Que signifie alors la proposition de n\u00e9gocier avec le chef de l\u2019Autorit\u00e9 palestinienne, qu\u2019on s\u2019applique du reste \u00e0 discr\u00e9diter comme lors du r\u00e9cent coup de force \u00e0 J\u00e9richo?\nDans ce contexte, il est presque path\u00e9tique de voir de nouvelles initiatives de paix \u00e9merger des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s palestinienne et isra\u00e9lienne, comme celle des combattants de la paix, qui va \u00eatre lanc\u00e9e publiquement lundi prochain. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019anciens officiers de l\u2019arm\u00e9e isra\u00e9lienne, qui se sont alli\u00e9s \u00e0 d\u2019anciens combattants arm\u00e9s palestiniens et qui ont tir\u00e9 de leur exp\u00e9rience respective la conviction commune que la solution aux probl\u00e8mes de la r\u00e9gion ne peut \u00eatre que politique et fond\u00e9e sur les r\u00e9solutions pertinentes des Nations unies depuis 1967.\nNous saluons tous la clairvoyance et le courage de telles femmes et de tels hommes! Mais qu\u2019attendent-ils de l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne? L\u2019aide seule ne suffit pas: chaque peuple a autant besoin de libert\u00e9 que de pain. Il reste que la suppression de l\u2019aide, m\u00eame partielle et temporaire, en provoquant l\u2019effondrement des derniers lambeaux de structures sociales, administratives et s\u00e9curitaires palestiniennes tirerait le rideau, et pour longtemps, sur tout espoir de paix juste.\nPlus g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, quel r\u00f4le politique devrait jouer l\u2019Europe aujourd\u2019hui? M.\u00a0Solana vient d\u2019\u00e9voquer le Conseil europ\u00e9en de Venise en 1980, c\u2019est une bonne r\u00e9f\u00e9rence. Il y a un quart de si\u00e8cle, en effet, \u00e0 un autre moment cl\u00e9 de l\u2019histoire du Proche-Orient, nous avions su prendre nos responsabilit\u00e9s. Nous avions alors officiellement reconnu l\u2019OLP et fait n\u00f4tre le principe \u00abdeux peuples, deux\u00a0\u00c9tats\u00bb. Le moment actuel, me semble-t-il, appelle un nouvel acte fort de l\u2019Europe. Cet acte doit viser \u00e0 redonner des rep\u00e8res clairs ouvrant une perspective fond\u00e9e sur le droit et \u00e0 faire rena\u00eetre l\u2019espoir des forces de paix dans toute la r\u00e9gion. C\u2019est dans cet esprit que j\u2019ai avanc\u00e9 l\u2019id\u00e9e de faire jouer un r\u00f4le d\u2019aiguillon \u00e0 notre propre institution: elle pourrait d\u00e9cider de r\u00e9unir sa Conf\u00e9rence des pr\u00e9sidents \u00e0 J\u00e9rusalem-Est pour y lancer \u00e0 tous les protagonistes un vrai message de paix.", "agenda_item": "Situation in the Middle East following the elections in Israel (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060405-ITEM-010", "intervention_id": "3-155", "summary_english": "{\n\"headline\": \"EU Must Take Strong Political Action on Middle East, Not Just Provide Aid, as Israeli Unilateral Policies Create Palestinian Humanitarian Crisis\",\n\"issueSum\": \"The speaker identifies several key issues: Israeli unilateral separation policies creating faits accomplis that prevent a viable Palestinian state; humanitarian crisis in Gaza described as 'on the brink of disaster'; severe restrictions on Palestinian movement including youth under 30 banned from leaving Nablus; transformation of Palestinian areas into border terminals; encirclement of East Jerusalem; and the inadequacy of EU aid-only approach to the conflict.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"The speaker strongly opposes Israeli unilateral policies, describing them as irresponsible and creating a deadlock.
