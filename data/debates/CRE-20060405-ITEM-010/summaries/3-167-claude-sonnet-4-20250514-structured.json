Israeli soldiers prevented excavations to let out the water; the bombardment of northern Gaza has destroyed agricultural areas and killed civilians. Nablus and Hebron are surrounded and incursions are being made there.\nWe have a great deal of responsibility, and we cannot keep on repeating the clich\u00e9 about two peoples and two states. There are not two peoples and two states: there is one state and something in development, a territory that is being constantly torn apart, both by this illegal wall and by force. Kadima and the Labour Party might represent an opportunity. I am in favour of exploiting all opportunities, but not in silence: we have to ask, and ask forcefully.\nFor two years now Hamas has declared and observed a ceasefire, and has halted its activities. Let us be extremely clear about this: for the last two years Hamas has not undertaken any activities, and must never do so again. Let us not, however \u2013 as we have since 1980 \u2013 keep on repeating the line about two peoples and two states, while all the while bearing witness to what is, quite simply, the theft of Palestinian land.\nWe need to be active with regard to Hamas, but also with regard to Israel, so that it understands that the international community has meaning.", "lang": "IT", "original": "Luisa Morgantini (GUE/NGL). \u2013 Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, per tre giorni ha piovuto nei territori occupati.

I soldati israeliani hanno impedito che si scavasse per far defluire l\u2019acqua, i bombardamenti del Nord di Gaza hanno distrutto aree agricole e ucciso civili.
