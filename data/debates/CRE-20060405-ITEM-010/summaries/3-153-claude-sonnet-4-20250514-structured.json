{"speaker": "Annemie Neyts-Uyttebroeck,", "english": "Annemie Neyts-Uyttebroeck, on behalf of the ALDE Group. \u2013 Mr President, the Palestinian and Israeli electorates have indeed dealt us a complicated hand. Each electorate seems to have favoured a party that is determined to act unilaterally and declares that it will not recognise or negotiate with the other. I am fully aware that there is a very important distinction between denial of a state\u2019s right to exist and refusal to recognise the legitimacy of a party that, until now, has not officially renounced the use of violence. So, the situation looks pretty bleak.\nBut could it be that each electorate has given priority to internal concerns, to matters that influence their everyday lives? Could it be that the Palestinians want an end to corruption, internal strife and administrative incompetence? Could it be that the Israelis want better economic prospects, social protection and a more equitable system? Could it be that each electorate voted in favour of what it saw as its own best interests, rather than against the other people?\nIf that is the case then there could be some hope. If Hamas recognises Israel, continues to observe the ceasefire and does not resume violence; and if Israel engages in easing the many restrictions, guarantees real rights of defence to the hundreds of Palestinians held in administrative detention, and refrains from holding people indefinitely in such detention, both the new Palestinian and the future Israeli Governments might find themselves somehow able to work together, if only to keep life going.\nI know it is a far cry from calls to revive the peace process, but maybe in the short term we can only hope for small steps in the right direction. We send our best wishes to both sides.\n(Applause)", "lang": "EN", "original": "Annemie Neyts-Uyttebroeck, on behalf of the ALDE Group. \u2013 Mr President, the Palestinian and Israeli electorates have indeed dealt us a complicated hand.
