This goes against the previous policy of the Palestinian police, and is a means of showing full respect for the teaching attributed to Mohammed, which says that in order to distinguish yourself from the infidels you should let your beard grow and clip your moustache.\nThis is a process of Talibanisation, therefore, which is rather worrying at a time when, after the identification of a would-be Saudi suicide bomber, a genuine Al-Qaida presence has been found within the borders of the State of Israel. Taken overall, this situation looks extremely worrying. Nor can the statements made by Foreign\u00a0Minister\u00a0al-Zahar, widely publicised by the international press, in which he gave hope of an open-minded attitude towards recognising Israel, and therefore the policy of two States, be seen as particularly encouraging or reassuring, given that only a few days before this same individual issued an incredible statement saying that his dream would be to hang on the walls of his home a fine map of the world on which the State of Israel did not appear.\nThe Talibanisation of Palestine is cause for concern.
