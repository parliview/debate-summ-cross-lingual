{"speaker": "Pierre Schapira (PSE). \u2013", "english": "Pierre Schapira (PSE). \u2013 (FR) Mr\u00a0President, I should like to begin by making some observations. Firstly, the demographic problem has been at the heart of the political debate; secondly, the Great Israel utopia is no more; thirdly, the social issue has been at the heart of the debate in Israel; and, fourthly, Hamas did not influence the elections in Israel.\nUnconsciously, the Israelis have once and for all acknowledged the existence of two States. It is now time for negotiation, but pressure must be brought to bear on Hamas so that it invalidates its Charter and finally recognises Israel as a valid negotiating partner. Otherwise, ladies and gentlemen, there will be a unilateral policy on both sides.\nPublic opinion in the two countries is in favour of peace. Europe must take advantage of this situation because it now has a crucial role to fulfil. Europe has expectations riding on it and, as regards aid for the Palestinians, I repeat that Europe must continue to grant its aid, otherwise a disaster will ensue in Palestine.", "lang": "FR", "original": "Pierre Schapira (PSE). - Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, tout d\u2019abord quelques constats.
