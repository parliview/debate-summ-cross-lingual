We can derive two main facts from this description. While Palestinians are governed by Hamas, an organisation that is unwilling to accept the basic principles of international law, the situation in Israel is different. The elections there may yield a government that wants above all to address the social and economic issues that are viewed by all people living in democratic societies as the most important ones for the governments to resolve.\nThis notwithstanding, the European Union faces a daunting challenge. The challenge is that, regardless of how we view Hamas \u2013 and I am sure that most of us view it as a terrorist organisation \u2013 you, in your capacity as our top representatives for external relations, must find a way of cooperating with the Hamas government.\nAs we progress down this road, I would ask only that you do not lose sight of the fact that all EU funds given in support of the Palestinians should remain subject to the condition that the Palestinian government respects the existence of Israel. And I would also like to ask if you could find out from Mr Kofi Annan exactly what was said about the existence of Israel in the letter he received from the Palestinian foreign minister?", "lang": "SK", "original": "Monika Be\u0148ov\u00e1 (PSE). \u2013 V\u00e1\u017een\u00fd p\u00e1n Solana, pani komis\u00e1rka, z toho, \u010do tu bolo povedan\u00e9, som si vybrala najm\u00e4 slov\u00e1 p\u00e1na Solanu, ktor\u00fd definoval situ\u00e1ciu aj v Palest\u00edne aj v Izraeli.
