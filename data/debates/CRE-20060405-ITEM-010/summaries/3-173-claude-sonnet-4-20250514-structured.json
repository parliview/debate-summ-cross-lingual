{"speaker": "Edith Mastenbroek (PSE). \u2013", "english": "Edith Mastenbroek (PSE). \u2013 Mr President, I would like to make a few brief points. First, on the three demands as outlined by Mr\u00a0Solana, I support all three but I fear that they are incomplete. I think that we should not only demand Hamas\u2019s respect for existing agreements, including the recognition of the State of Israel; we should also demand Hamas\u2019s full respect of democratic decision-making in Palestinian politics, of which this was a result. We need to demand that Hamas does not touch the human rights of Palestinians. Our full support should go to the Palestinian women that were demonstrating for their rights recently on International Women\u2019s Day.\nMr Solana said that Hamas cannot change the past, but it can change the future. It was Ariel Sharon who once said that once you find yourself in power, your perspective on the world changes dramatically, and some world leaders have come out and described him as a man of peace. We cannot exclude the possibility that Hamas will rise to the occasion. I would not bet my last dime on it though. We therefore need a long-term strategy.\nIt is my hope that the next time we see elections in Palestine, the Palestinian people will vote Hamas out and the only party that will be able to beat Hamas is al-Fatah. The young generation of al-Fatah, meaning anyone under 50 for that matter, is calling for internal reform, and I think it is right to do so. That generation has the potential to reconnect al-Fatah to the Palestinian street. I stand in full support of its goals and I call on all my colleagues to look for ways to invest in this reform movement.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Edith Mastenbroek (PSE). \u2013 Mr President, I would like to make a few brief points.
