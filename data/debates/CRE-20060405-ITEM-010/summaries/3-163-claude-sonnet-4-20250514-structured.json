This is to be welcomed, as the United States is no longer an objective player in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\nMr\u00a0Solana, I believe you are charged with expressing the wishes of the Union as a whole and of all the political groups represented in this Chamber. Israel has itself experienced what it is to be a stateless nation. It created its state by force and should therefore set a good example by agreeing to the creation of the Palestinian State.
