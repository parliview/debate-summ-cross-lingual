Again and again the EU assumes illegitimately the role and characteristics of a political state. This is not a debate about how to solve the problems in the Middle East. This is a debate about how to further an illegitimate United States of Europe.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Gerard Batten (IND/DEM). \u2013 Mr President, you introduced Mr Solana as the High Representative of the European Union\u2019s common foreign and security policy.
