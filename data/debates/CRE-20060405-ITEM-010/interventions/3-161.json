At the same time, Canada suspended aid to the Palestinian Authority and President Bush stated that he would not agree to aid a Hamas-led government. However, one has to understand that Hamas was elected in a free and fair election.\nI welcome the recent statements made by Mr Haniyeh that his government would cooperate with Mr Abbas, which seems to transmit a softer image of Hamas. Yesterday the Ministry of Foreign Affairs made the same statement.\nWe must continue to endorse the Quartet\u2019s statements that the new Palestinian Government needs to commit itself to the principles of non-violence, the recognition of Israel and the acceptance of previous agreements and obligations, including the roadmap. We must never forget that suspending aid to the Palestinians would make it look as though we were directly punishing the Palestinian people for their choice, and subsequently we would increase their suffering. The European Parliament has to contribute to all possible efforts to restore peace, not only between Israel and Palestine, but also in the wider Middle East region.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Adamos Adamou (GUE/NGL). \u2013 Mr President, a few days ago American diplomats were forbidden to make contact with officials in any Palestinian Government agency controlled by Hamas.
