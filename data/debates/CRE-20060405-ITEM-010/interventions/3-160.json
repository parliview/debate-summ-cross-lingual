Democracy is about EU values of peace and respect, not about wanting your neighbour to disappear from the world\u2019s map as Mr al-Zahar, the new Palestinian Foreign Minister, put it this week. He said: \u2018I dream of hanging up a huge map of the world which does not show Israel on it\u2019.\nThe EU must demand that the PA Government renounces violence, recognises the State of Israel and the relevant agreements and commits to the roadmap, otherwise the EU should not legitimise Hamas in any way. Now that it has no partner on the Palestinian side, Israel needs all our support to continue its commitment to the peace process.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Hannu Takkula (ALDE). \u2013 Mr President, the result of the Israeli elections gave the answer of the people in Israel.
