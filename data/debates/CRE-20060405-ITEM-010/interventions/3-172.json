They are socialists, they are our sister party and I welcome their manifesto commitment that \u2018the occupation erodes the moral fibre of Israeli society\u2019, along with Amir Peretz\u2019s Herzliya speech in support of respect for international borders. Both provide very important commitments to the way forward.\nI thank both the Commissioner and the High Representative for restating this afternoon Europe\u2019s commitment to a negotiated, not unilateral, solution. To the Commissioner, I repeat our private discussions that, whilst it is absolutely right for her to put conditions on European aid to the Palestinian Authority, I ask her to develop plans to avoid a humanitarian disaster in the Palestinian territories if Hamas does not move as quickly as we all hope.\nTo Mr Solana, I ask him to consider how easy it was for the Rafah crossing \u2013 supposedly guaranteed by the EU \u2013 to be closed during the recent Israeli actions, together with the legality of Israel withholding customs payments to the Palestinian Authority, guaranteed under the Paris Agreement. These are legal obligations to which the European Union and the Quartet have a duty to seek compliance.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Richard Howitt (PSE). \u2013 Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating the Israeli Labour Party on entering into government.
