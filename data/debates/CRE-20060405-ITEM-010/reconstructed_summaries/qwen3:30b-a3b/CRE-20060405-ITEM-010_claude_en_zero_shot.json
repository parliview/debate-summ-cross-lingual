Let me start by reading through the debate summary carefully.\n\nThe summary mentions that there were 26 speakers, and the topics included the EU's position, various parliamentary group positions, key dividing lines, innovative proposals, and a concluding assessment. The speaker in question is the \"President.\" \n\nFirst, I should check if the President is mentioned anywhere in the summary. The Executive Summary section talks about Javier Solana and Benita Ferrero-Waldner, but not the President. The Parliamentary Group Positions section lists different groups like PPE-DE, PSE, ALDE, and GUE/NGL, with specific speakers like Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Salafranca, Elmar Brok, V\u00e9ronique De Keyser, etc. The Key Dividing Lines section mentions names like Hannu Takkula, Panagiotis Beglitis, and Richard Howitt. The Innovative Proposals section mentions Daniel Marc Cohn-Bendit. The Concluding Assessment doesn't mention the President either.\n\nWait, the user is asking about the \"President.\" In the context of the European Parliament, the President is a specific role. However, the summary provided doesn't mention the President of the European Parliament. The speakers listed are MEPs from different groups. The President might not have made a contribution in this debate, or perhaps their remarks aren't detailed in the summary. \n\nThe user's instruction says that if there are no points attributed to the speaker, I should respond with an empty string. Since the summary doesn't mention the President's contributions, the answer would be empty. But I need to make sure I didn't miss any part of the summary. Let me scan again.\n\nLooking through the sections again: the Debate Information mentions the institution is the European Parliament, but the speakers listed in the Executive Summary are Javier Solana (High Representative) and Benita Ferrero-Waldner (Commissioner). The Parliamentary Group Positions list various MEPs. The Key Dividing Lines and Innovative Proposals also mention MEPs. The Concluding Assessment is a general summary. There's no mention of the President of the European Parliament making a statement here. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be an empty string because the President isn't mentioned as a speaker in the debate summary provided.\n</think>\n\n\"", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Javier Solana,", "english": "Javier Solana, High Representative for the CFSP . (ES) Mr President, I am speaking to you here in the European Parliament at a time which I believe to be critical to future peace in the Middle East, immediately after the creation of the new Palestinian Government and the elections in Israel.\nI would like to talk briefly about the current situation and draw a few conclusions in relation to the responsibilities the European Union should take on at this moment which could be absolutely crucial to future peace in the Middle East.\nI would like to begin with the situation in the occupied territories. As you know, Hamas has taken control of the government; it is not a coalition government, but a Hamas government, and unfortunately the programme presented by its Prime Minister, Ismail Haniya, is not acceptable to the international community. It does not give any clear indication that the Hamas government is prepared to respect the principles established by the European Union, and not just by us, but also by the Quartet and by the international community, in a very broad sense: to renounce violence as a means for resolving conflicts \u2014 and this conflict in particular \u2014 to recognise the State of Israel and to respect the previous agreements signed by the Palestinians and Israel.\nMr President, I believe that those principles are minimum requirements if the political ideal that the European Union has always defended is to be realised. That ideal is no less than a negotiated solution leading to the creation of a viable Palestinian State living peacefully alongside Israel, within the framework of the principles of international law. It is clear, Mr President, that there can be no negotiation if the parties do not recognise each other, there can be no peaceful arrangement if the parties believe that arms can resolve the conflict and there can be no solution based on the principles of international law if the parties disregard the fundamental principle that agreements must be complied with.\nWe believe that all of this has inescapable consequences as far as the European Union is concerned. We must wait and see what happens in the future, but for the moment it is impossible for Hamas to be seen as a valid interlocutor unless it changes its views.\nMr President, please allow me to say a few words about the result of the Israeli elections. There is no question that this result can be interpreted in many different ways. It would not be appropriate for me to carry out a detailed analysis of the result of these elections, but I believe that a few comments may help us all to find formulae that allow us to carry out an analysis with a view to identifying different ways to work. I would like firstly to point out that, although there has been a clear winner, the Kadima party, it has not achieved the results it wanted, and that may have a certain impact on the negotiations on forming a coalition government, which is essential, although Mr\u00a0Olmert has already chosen the Labour Party as the foundation for his coalition.\nSecondly, and I believe this to be important, I believe that we must take note of the fact that the election result shows a shift away from the strictly political towards the economic and social. I believe that that analysis can explain the result achieved by the Labour Party, and that achieved by the Pensioners' Party or those parties with a limited social or linguistic base, including the Shas party or the Israel Beitenu party, the party of the Russian-speaking community.\nThirdly, and I believe this is perhaps the most worrying thing for all of us and for the peace process, I believe that the elections have demonstrated a consolidation of a desire for what I would call separation, perhaps illustrated by the completion of the wall and the absence of dialogue between the two peoples on defining Israel\u2019s borders. We view this as an unsustainable situation. We have always argued that the final borders could only be established on the basis of a mutual agreement. We are therefore in favour of negotiation in order to resolve these problems, as we have always been.\nThe inward-looking focus of the Israeli electorate has a parallel in Hamas\u2019s desire to focus on Palestinian issues and to ignore an Israel whose right to exist it still rejects. And we cannot ignore the fact that all of this has consequences in terms of the possibility of applying what we have seen as the roadmap. Although these are difficult times for that roadmap, it must continue to be the reference point for seeking a definitive solution to the process.\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, beyond the aspects relating to the Middle East peace process, the victory in Palestine of a movement such as Hamas, which is affiliated to the Muslim Brothers, in elections that were free and democratic, as acknowledged by the Union\u2019s own observers, is a complete novelty. The European Union does not want the Hamas government to fail, and it must not want that, on principle. What we want is for that government, as well as respecting the principles of which it is well aware, which have been proposed by the international community, also to apply the principles of law, the rule of law and democratic alternation, and to preserve the pluralistic nature of Palestinian society. If it does so, we will be able to look at Hamas as a fully legitimate political body.\nWithin this context, what position do I believe Europe should take? I would like once again to stress something that is absolutely clear: a satisfactory solution to the conflict has been, is and will remain a fundamental priority for us, the Europeans. Now, more than ever, we must insist that only a negotiated solution can be stable and lasting. We must therefore continue to put pressure on both parties to commit to a negotiated solution based on the existence of two States. I believe that we should also reiterate today that the European Union believes that peace must be based on respect for the 1967 borders and that only territorial changes agreed by both parties will be acceptable.\nAs you know, the European Union\u2019s role over recent months has increased considerably; we now have two operations on the ground: a police operation and the important operation at the Rafah border crossing, which is still very much active. More than 200\u00a0000 people have crossed from Egypt to Gaza and from Gaza to Egypt since it was opened in November thanks to the presence of generous people from the European Union.\nMr President, our fundamental objective is to get through the period ahead of us, which will remain a period of some uncertainty, in such a way that, when better conditions are in place for a negotiated peace \u2013 and I hope that will be soon \u2013 the European Union can continue to enjoy the trust of both parties and make an active contribution to achieving peace when that time comes.\nWith regard to the fundamental parties in the conflict, our principles at the moment are clear and are as follows. With regard to Palestine, the European Union will continue to support President Abbas and the peace programme on the basis of which he was elected by an enormous, overwhelming, majority of Palestinian voters, and we must not forget that. Consistent with the Quartet\u2019s statement of 30 March, the European Union is currently reviewing its programmes of aid to the Palestinian authorities. Until Hamas expresses unequivocally that it intends to respect the principles of the international community, we clearly will not be able to talk about \u2018business as usual\u2019. But I would also like to make it very clear that the European Union will maintain aid for the Palestinian people, and it must do this for at least two reasons: firstly, because it is a moral imperative, which the European Union must never renounce \u2014 it has not done so in the past, it is not doing so today, and it will not do so in the future \u2014 and, secondly, because the humanitarian crisis and instability in the occupied territories do not benefit anybody, including Israel itself.\nLadies and gentlemen, another of the European Union\u2019s fundamental objectives is to preserve the institutional structure of the Palestinian Authority. The European Union has invested a lot, has devoted resources and effort to the creation of that Authority and believes that it must be maintained, so that one day there may be a viable and democratic Palestinian State.\nWith regard to Israel, Mr President, the European Union must continue to reject any unilateral measures that may jeopardise the two-State solution. In particular, the Union will be watching the development of the situation in East Jerusalem, in the Jordan Valley, where Israel is carrying out actions that are particularly damaging to the Palestinians, as well as the construction of the separation barrier. In accordance with international humanitarian law, Israel has a series of obligations as the occupying power. To facilitate the transit of humanitarian aid to the Palestinian population is fundamental, but beyond a strict interpretation of this obligation, Israel should also facilitate movement within the occupied territories in order to make economic sustainability possible, without compromising the security of Israelis, which nobody wants to see. In this context, I believe that it is urgent for the parties to apply the Agreement on Access and Movement, which was signed in November 2005 in Jerusalem, and I was present at is signature. That Agreement led to the opening of the Rafah border post \u2013 where the Union plays a role, as I have said \u2013 and other mechanisms for transit between Israel and the occupied territories.\nIsrael \u2013 and allow me to stress what I am about to say as emphatically as possible, and I hope that everybody understands it, including our good friend, the future Prime Minister, Mr Olmert \u2013 must transfer the money that it collects through tariffs and taxes on behalf of the Palestinian Authority \u2013 and which does not belong to it \u2013 to that Authority.\n(Applause)\nIsrael cannot and must not hold on to this money. I would like to state as loudly and clearly as possible that we are prepared to work with both parties to ensure that those resources are used for good purposes and I believe that that will be possible, if there is sufficient will on both sides.\nThirdly, I would like to say a few words about the international framework and the Union\u2019s objectives. We must continue to work within the Quartet. Defending international legality requires the decisive support of the whole of the community of nations which are currently to a greater or lesser extent represented in the Quartet. We must also involve the Arab States, which can, and today must, do much more from economic and political points of view. In this regard, I would like to refer to the initiative of the Beirut peace plan, with a view to bringing Hamas closer to that plan as well, a plan that on other occasions has been called the \u2018Arab peace plan\u2019, since I believe that may offer certain possibilities in terms of progressing in that direction.\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that at this point we must not forget that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict falls within the context of a serious crisis that affects the whole of the Middle East region. We must work on the peace process, bearing in mind the positive role that the States of the region can play, but also bearing in mind the negative role that certain States can play, and certain negative influences and negative repercussions, such as the situation in Iraq or the situation in Iran.\nMr President, I shall draw to a close so that you do not have to ask me to stop. The results of the elections in the occupied territories and in Israel have undoubtedly created a new situation. I believe that the European Union must approach it on the basis of two principles which may apparently, but only apparently, seem contradictory: rigour and flexibility.\nWhy rigour? In order to maintain the principles that have defined Europe's position since the Venice European Council of 1980, that is to say, respect for the rights of the Israeli and the Palestinian people, which must be consolidated in a negotiated solution, which leads \u2014 as I have said so many times and all of you have repeated \u2014 to the creation of an independent, sovereign and democratic Palestinian State living peacefully alongside Israel.\nAnd flexibility, in order to adapt to the development of a reality on the ground which is going to change, which can be changeable, and to support any solutions that may allow progress to be made towards peace.\nI would also like to address the Palestinian Government in a very direct way from this Chamber, which represents the heart of the European Union. Hamas cannot change its past, but it can and must change its future.\n(Applause)\nI would like to say to the leaders of Hamas that if they decide that there is no place in that future for terror, for violence or for denying the reality of the State of Israel, the European Union will know how to respond appropriately, as it has always done.\n(Applause)", "lang": "EN", "original": "Javier Solana, High Representative for the CFSP .

It would not be appropriate for me to carry out a detailed analysis of the result of these elections, but I believe that a few comments may help us all to find formulae that allow us to carry out an analysis with a view to identifying different ways to work. I would like firstly to point out that, although there has been a clear winner, the Kadima party, it has not achieved the results it wanted, and that may have a certain impact on the negotiations on forming a coalition government, which is essential, although Mr\u00a0Olmert has already chosen the Labour Party as the foundation for his coalition.\nSecondly, and I believe this to be important, I believe that we must take note of the fact that the election result shows a shift away from the strictly political towards the economic and social. I believe that that analysis can explain the result achieved by the Labour Party, and that achieved by the Pensioners' Party or those parties with a limited social or linguistic base, including the Shas party or the Israel Beitenu party, the party of the Russian-speaking community.\nThirdly, and I believe this is perhaps the most worrying thing for all of us and for the peace process, I believe that the elections have demonstrated a consolidation of a desire for what I would call separation, perhaps illustrated by the completion of the wall and the absence of dialogue between the two peoples on defining Israel\u2019s borders. We view this as an unsustainable situation. We have always argued that the final borders could only be established on the basis of a mutual agreement. We are therefore in favour of negotiation in order to resolve these problems, as we have always been.\nThe inward-looking focus of the Israeli electorate has a parallel in Hamas\u2019s desire to focus on Palestinian issues and to ignore an Israel whose right to exist it still rejects. And we cannot ignore the fact that all of this has consequences in terms of the possibility of applying what we have seen as the roadmap. Although these are difficult times for that roadmap, it must continue to be the reference point for seeking a definitive solution to the process.\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, beyond the aspects relating to the Middle East peace process, the victory in Palestine of a movement such as Hamas, which is affiliated to the Muslim Brothers, in elections that were free and democratic, as acknowledged by the Union\u2019s own observers, is a complete novelty. The European Union does not want the Hamas government to fail, and it must not want that, on principle. What we want is for that government, as well as respecting the principles of which it is well aware, which have been proposed by the international community, also to apply the principles of law, the rule of law and democratic alternation, and to preserve the pluralistic nature of Palestinian society. If it does so, we will be able to look at Hamas as a fully legitimate political body.\nWithin this context, what position do I believe Europe should take? I would like once again to stress something that is absolutely clear: a satisfactory solution to the conflict has been, is and will remain a fundamental priority for us, the Europeans. Now, more than ever, we must insist that only a negotiated solution can be stable and lasting. We must therefore continue to put pressure on both parties to commit to a negotiated solution based on the existence of two States. I believe that we should also reiterate today that the European Union believes that peace must be based on respect for the 1967 borders and that only territorial changes agreed by both parties will be acceptable.\nAs you know, the European Union\u2019s role over recent months has increased considerably; we now have two operations on the ground: a police operation and the important operation at the Rafah border crossing, which is still very much active. More than 200\u00a0000 people have crossed from Egypt to Gaza and from Gaza to Egypt since it was opened in November thanks to the presence of generous people from the European Union.\nMr President, our fundamental objective is to get through the period ahead of us, which will remain a period of some uncertainty, in such a way that, when better conditions are in place for a negotiated peace \u2013 and I hope that will be soon \u2013 the European Union can continue to enjoy the trust of both parties and make an active contribution to achieving peace when that time comes.\nWith regard to the fundamental parties in the conflict, our principles at the moment are clear and are as follows. With regard to Palestine, the European Union will continue to support President Abbas and the peace programme on the basis of which he was elected by an enormous, overwhelming, majority of Palestinian voters, and we must not forget that. Consistent with the Quartet\u2019s statement of 30 March, the European Union is currently reviewing its programmes of aid to the Palestinian authorities. Until Hamas expresses unequivocally that it intends to respect the principles of the international community, we clearly will not be able to talk about \u2018business as usual\u2019. But I would also like to make it very clear that the European Union will maintain aid for the Palestinian people, and it must do this for at least two reasons: firstly, because it is a moral imperative, which the European Union must never renounce \u2014 it has not done so in the past, it is not doing so today, and it will not do so in the future \u2014 and, secondly, because the humanitarian crisis and instability in the occupied territories do not benefit anybody, including Israel itself.\nLadies and gentlemen, another of the European Union\u2019s fundamental objectives is to preserve the institutional structure of the Palestinian Authority. The European Union has invested a lot, has devoted resources and effort to the creation of that Authority and believes that it must be maintained, so that one day there may be a viable and democratic Palestinian State.\nWith regard to Israel, Mr President, the European Union must continue to reject any unilateral measures that may jeopardise the two-State solution. In particular, the Union will be watching the development of the situation in East Jerusalem, in the Jordan Valley, where Israel is carrying out actions that are particularly damaging to the Palestinians, as well as the construction of the separation barrier. In accordance with international humanitarian law, Israel has a series of obligations as the occupying power. To facilitate the transit of humanitarian aid to the Palestinian population is fundamental, but beyond a strict interpretation of this obligation, Israel should also facilitate movement within the occupied territories in order to make economic sustainability possible, without compromising the security of Israelis, which nobody wants to see. In this context, I believe that it is urgent for the parties to apply the Agreement on Access and Movement, which was signed in November 2005 in Jerusalem, and I was present at is signature. That Agreement led to the opening of the Rafah border post \u2013 where the Union plays a role, as I have said \u2013 and other mechanisms for transit between Israel and the occupied territories.\nIsrael \u2013 and allow me to stress what I am about to say as emphatically as possible, and I hope that everybody understands it, including our good friend, the future Prime Minister, Mr Olmert \u2013 must transfer the money that it collects through tariffs and taxes on behalf of the Palestinian Authority \u2013 and which does not belong to it \u2013 to that Authority.\n(Applause)\nIsrael cannot and must not hold on to this money. I would like to state as loudly and clearly as possible that we are prepared to work with both parties to ensure that those resources are used for good purposes and I believe that that will be possible, if there is sufficient will on both sides.\nThirdly, I would like to say a few words about the international framework and the Union\u2019s objectives. We must continue to work within the Quartet. Defending international legality requires the decisive support of the whole of the community of nations which are currently to a greater or lesser extent represented in the Quartet. We must also involve the Arab States, which can, and today must, do much more from economic and political points of view. In this regard, I would like to refer to the initiative of the Beirut peace plan, with a view to bringing Hamas closer to that plan as well, a plan that on other occasions has been called the \u2018Arab peace plan\u2019, since I believe that may offer certain possibilities in terms of progressing in that direction.\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that at this point we must not forget that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict falls within the context of a serious crisis that affects the whole of the Middle East region. We must work on the peace process, bearing in mind the positive role that the States of the region can play, but also bearing in mind the negative role that certain States can play, and certain negative influences and negative repercussions, such as the situation in Iraq or the situation in Iran.\nMr President, I shall draw to a close so that you do not have to ask me to stop. The results of the elections in the occupied territories and in Israel have undoubtedly created a new situation. I believe that the European Union must approach it on the basis of two principles which may apparently, but only apparently, seem contradictory: rigour and flexibility.\nWhy rigour? In order to maintain the principles that have defined Europe's position since the Venice European Council of 1980, that is to say, respect for the rights of the Israeli and the Palestinian people, which must be consolidated in a negotiated solution, which leads \u2014 as I have said so many times and all of you have repeated \u2014 to the creation of an independent, sovereign and democratic Palestinian State living peacefully alongside Israel.\nAnd flexibility, in order to adapt to the development of a reality on the ground which is going to change, which can be changeable, and to support any solutions that may allow progress to be made towards peace.\nI would also like to address the Palestinian Government in a very direct way from this Chamber, which represents the heart of the European Union. Hamas cannot change its past, but it can and must change its future.\n(Applause)\nI would like to say to the leaders of Hamas that if they decide that there is no place in that future for terror, for violence or for denying the reality of the State of Israel, the European Union will know how to respond appropriately, as it has always done.\n(Applause)", "reconstructed_position": "<think>\nOkay, I need to outline the main points or arguments made by Javier Solana based on the provided debate summary. Let me start by reading through the summary carefully.\n\nThe user mentioned that the debate was about the situation in the Middle East following Israeli elections, specifically mentioning Hamas's victory and Kadima's rise. The summary has sections on EU leadership positions, with Javier Solana as the High Representative for CFSP. \n\nLooking at the Executive Summary section under EU Leadership Position, there's a part about Javier Solana. The key points here are that he established the EU's framework with three non-negotiable conditions for Hamas: renouncing violence, recognizing Israel, and respecting previous agreements. The quote provided is \"Hamas cannot change its past, but it can and must change its future.\" Additionally, Solana emphasized \"rigour and flexibility,\" meaning maintaining EU principles while adapting to new realities. He also demanded Israel transfer Palestinian tax revenues, stating \"Israel cannot and must not hold on to this money.\"\n\nI need to make sure I only include what's attributed to Solana. The summary mentions other speakers like Benita Ferrero-Waldner, but the user is asking specifically about Solana. The other sections like Parliamentary Group Positions and Key Dividing Lines mention other MEPs, but those shouldn't be included. The user wants only the points from Solana.\n\nSo the main points are:\n1. Three non-negotiable conditions for Hamas: renounce violence, recognize Israel, respect agreements.\n2. The statement about Hamas's past vs. future.\n3. The need for \"rigour and flexibility\" in EU approach.\n4. Demand for Israel to transfer Palestinian tax revenues.\n\nI should present these as the arguments made by Solana.

He stated that while Hamas \"cannot change its past,\" it \"can and must change its future.\" Solana advocated for a balance of \"rigour and flexibility,\" maintaining EU principles while adapting to changing realities.

Mr President, I think Mr Solana has already covered nearly everything, but let me add a few comments because the Commission is facing a very difficult period of profound and rapid change in the Middle East. How we react and how the parties position themselves will have a determining influence on the prospects for moving towards what I hope will be a peaceful solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\nWe have congratulated acting Prime Minister Olmert on Kadima\u2019s election victory. This undoubtedly represents some shift in Israeli politics and we await with interest the outcome of the coalition negotiations currently taking place. That will take some time.\nLet me underline that we, as the European Union, stand ready to work with the next Israeli Government to promote security and peace, but for both Israelis and Palestinians alike. I am convinced that the majority of the population in both countries profoundly desires a peaceful and sustainable solution to the conflict. As for the European Union\u2019s bilateral relationship with Israel, our sincere wish is to reinforce a strong, balanced relationship between us, reflected in our Association Agreement and in our ENP Action Plan. We want to continue the progress that already has been made in implementing the action plan in areas such as human rights, the protection of minorities, research and development, as well as economic integration.\nThere has been much speculation about the impact these elections will have on the prospects for peace, which Mr\u00a0Solana has just tried to outline. One might be tempted to believe that the election result broadly endorsed acting Prime Minister Olmert\u2019s avowed intention to proceed with the establishment of permanent borders for Israel by 2010, following further disengagement from the occupied West Bank. The question for us is how this will be done. We strongly believe that Israel\u2019s legitimate security concerns cannot be met\u00a0\u2013 and I would like to reiterate this on behalf of the Commission\u00a0\u2013 through unilateral action or decisions imposed by force. Only a negotiated settlement will be sustainable.\nThe European Union would only support changes to the pre-1967 borders that were agreed by consensus between the parties. We support a two-state solution leading to a final and comprehensive settlement of the conflict, with Israel and a Palestinian state living side by side within secure and mutually recognised borders.\nI think it is important to say again and again that we should underline to our Israeli partners the importance of refraining from any action that may prejudice final status negotiations. The Commission expects the next Israeli Government to reaffirm its commitment to a negotiated solution by full implementation of the Quartet\u2019s roadmap, and to show this in deeds as well as words. But as ever, we have to work with both sides. Just as we must be clear with the new Israeli Government, we also have to be very firm with the new Palestinian Government. There can be no compromise on the Quartet\u2019s principles \u2013 Mr Solana has just outlined them, we have mentioned them in the Council statement, we have also mentioned them in the Quartet.\nWe expect the new Palestinian Government\u00a0\u2013 sworn in last week\u00a0\u2013 to commit to the principles of non-violence, recognition of Israel and acceptance of previous agreements and obligations, including the roadmap, which then bind the Palestinian Authority to the fundamental principles of peace, democracy, respect for the rule of law and human rights. Of course, we have heard quite a number of comments, some of which go further; but we have also seen some very slight signs of possible solutions, possible changes.\nWe are fully aware of the considerable economic and humanitarian needs of the Palestinians\u00a0\u2013 and indeed we do not want to let them down\u00a0\u2013 and of the need to break the vicious cycle of poverty and extremism. That is why the Commission has already mobilised over EUR\u00a0120\u00a0million to help meet the basic needs of the Palestinians and to stabilise the finances of the caretaker government, which has just left office. That is why we intend to continue to provide emergency humanitarian aid and assistance for basic human needs.\nBut, and I must repeat this because it will be the basis for what can be done, unless the new government complies with the Quartet\u2019s conditions, there can be no \u2018business as usual\u2019. Unless circumstances change, there will inevitably be an impact on assistance to the Palestinian Government, which the Commission is now reviewing in line with the Quartet statement. In this regard, we are just preparing the next Council, where we will try to come up with lines of approach; we will not have full solutions, but we will try to move in the right direction.\nSo the onus is clearly on the Palestinian side, and on the new Israeli Government to act responsibly in fulfilling its obligations. I firmly believe that both sides, especially the population, are tired of the conflict and desperate for peace, but it is up to their leaders to show responsibility and statesmanship as we move forward. It is in their hands, and only in theirs, to put an end to the violence and despair that has blighted the lives of so many generations.

Let me start by looking through the summary again to find any mentions of him.\n\nIn the \"Executive Summary\" section under \"Parliamentary Group Positions,\" there's a part about the Conservative Approach (PPE-DE) where Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Salafranca is mentioned. The summary states: \"Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Salafranca strongly supported Quartet demands, asking how to ensure humanitarian aid doesn't fund terrorism.\" \n\nSo, the key point here is that Salafranca supported the Quartet's conditions. The Quartet conditions are the three non-negotiables for Hamas: renouncing violence, recognizing Israel, and respecting previous agreements. The summary also mentions he asked about ensuring humanitarian aid doesn't fund terrorism. That suggests he was concerned about the potential misuse of aid, possibly implying that aid should be controlled to prevent it from going to terrorist groups. \n\nI need to make sure there are no other mentions of him in other parts of the summary. Scanning through the rest, under \"Key Dividing Lines,\" there's a mention of Hannu Takkula, but not Salafranca. In the \"Innovative Proposals\" section, it's Cohn-Bendit. The rest of the summary talks about other speakers like Brok, De Keyser, etc., but not Salafranca. \n\nSo the only direct mention is in the PPE-DE section. His arguments are about supporting the Quartet's demands and ensuring humanitarian aid doesn't fund terrorism. The summary doesn't attribute any other points to him. Therefore, the main points are his support for the Quartet conditions and his concern about humanitarian aid funding terrorism.\n</think>\n\nJos\u00e9 Ignacio Salafranca S\u00e1nchez-Neyra strongly supported the Quartet's demands, emphasizing the need to ensure humanitarian aid does not fund terrorism.

Both the Palestinians and the Israelis want an end to the conflict and feel the urgent need to fight against poverty. This equation is not bad after all, and if the European Union wants to play a part in it, then it must tackle three problems.\nFirstly, it must support Palestine financially, and that includes not only the basic needs, but also the public services that are on the verge of collapse. In Gaza, where 35% of workers are employed by the Palestinian Authority and where 75% of Palestinians live below the poverty line, famine is starting to become rife, employees are no longer being paid and, according to official sources, avian influenza could combine with human influenza and give rise to the dreaded pandemic. This support for the public services cannot, however, take the form of support for an unofficial presidential administration that would set itself up more or less as an opposition force.\nSecondly, the European Union must hold talks with Hamas, under certain conditions, certainly, but it must hold talks. Mr\u00a0Carter had already as good as said this back in January, and Mr\u00a0Clinton recently affirmed it. For all those who remember the many terrorist movements that have become respectable political parties, but also for all those who want peace and who respect the electoral choice of nearly half of the Palestinian population, it is vital that we begin talks and it is vital that we open negotiations. Hamas is abiding by its truce, and its Foreign Affairs Minister has just, to everyone\u2019s surprise, I admit, half-opened a door by not excluding a two-State solution. Let us seize this opportunity. The idea of backtracking and of acknowledging the State of Israel on the basis of the 1967 borders is already, in itself, a negotiation, because it implies that Israel itself recognises this drawing from 1967.\nThirdly, the European Union must obtain a guarantee from the Israeli Government that the unilateral disengagement plan is only a plan B and not a plan A. It is true that it is more difficult to negotiate peace than to ensure a reasonable level of security for oneself by unilateral and forceful means. If, however, the unilateral convergence plan turns into Israel\u2019s secret programme, then that will mean not only the end of the road map and of any bilateral initiative, but also the end of any hopes of peace, and Europe will lose any credible influence it has in that part of the world.\nThere you have three problems requiring solutions, but I have seen that you have already grasped the main lines of action in relation to this.\n(Applause)", "lang": "FR", "original": "V\u00e9ronique De Keyser, au nom du groupe PSE . - Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, l\u2019effervescence qui avait pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 les \u00e9lections palestiniennes et isra\u00e9liennes se calme et l\u2019on y voit plus clair.\nNous nous trouvons face \u00e0 de nouveaux partis, de nouveaux acteurs, de nouvelles difficult\u00e9s mais peut-\u00eatre aussi face \u00e0 un espoir.

Let us seize this opportunity. The idea of backtracking and of acknowledging the State of Israel on the basis of the 1967 borders is already, in itself, a negotiation, because it implies that Israel itself recognises this drawing from 1967.\nThirdly, the European Union must obtain a guarantee from the Israeli Government that the unilateral disengagement plan is only a plan B and not a plan A. It is true that it is more difficult to negotiate peace than to ensure a reasonable level of security for oneself by unilateral and forceful means. If, however, the unilateral convergence plan turns into Israel\u2019s secret programme, then that will mean not only the end of the road map and of any bilateral initiative, but also the end of any hopes of peace, and Europe will lose any credible influence it has in that part of the world.\nThere you have three problems requiring solutions, but I have seen that you have already grasped the main lines of action in relation to this.\n(Applause)", "reconstructed_position": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the main points or arguments made by V\u00e9ronique De Keyser in the parliamentary debate summary provided.

Thus, you have a Palestinian Government that wants unilaterally to define what constitutes Palestine and what must not constitute Israel, and an Israeli Government that wants unilaterally to define what constitutes Israel and what must not constitute the Palestinian State.\nUnder these circumstances, I believe that we need to look at actual examples. Thus, if you take the problem of drinking water in that region \u2013 and Mrs\u00a0de Keyser spoke about avian influenza \u2013 you cannot tackle the problem of drinking water or of avian influenza without negotiations being held between the Palestinian Government and the Israeli Government, because drinking water comes from the West Bank and goes to Israel. It is the same water. If the USD\u00a0230\u00a0million are not granted by the European Union, then there will be no drinking water either in Israel or in the West Bank. Who wins? No one!\nLet us consider some examples: avian influenza. If it affects Gaza, then it affects Israel. You cannot stop it any more than the unilateral withdrawal from Israel could. It is not possible. Not even Israel can do that. Circumstances therefore exist in which the European Union can force the governments to negotiate because their vital interests require this, and the environment is one such example.\nSecondly, as regards the road map, why not make a quintet out of a quartet? Let us include the Arab League, let us take the Quartet together with the Arab League and let us enter into negotiations by saying, \u2018the Arab League is present, so Mr\u00a0Abbas and Israel will have to negotiate simultaneously with the Quartet and the Arab League\u2019. There might be some intelligent human beings who ban one or two Palestinian representatives from the Arab League delegation, and that would not be a bad thing. Therefore, we can and we must be inventive, we must be intelligent and we must say things clearly. The wall is not just a security measure, it is a territorial conquest, it is unilateral and it runs counter to all of the European Union\u2019s principles, just as the non-recognition of Israel ran counter to the European Union\u2019s principles. They both run counter to the European Union\u2019s principles and this requires an explanation. A wall built inside the 1967 borders is one thing; a wall as it stands today constitutes a territorial conquest, and that is something we cannot accept.\nTo conclude, allow me to say one thing: we must be very clear with both sides and make them fully aware that our principles are our principles. In that way, we will be able to make them negotiate with each other.\nI have one final remark to make about Mr\u00a0Abbas: it is true that he was elected, but I, for my part, come from a country in which a certain Mr\u00a0Chirac was elected on the strength of 82% of the vote, a man who, despite everything, now has the support of a very small proportion of the French population.", "lang": "FR", "original": "Daniel Marc Cohn-Bendit, au nom du groupe Verts/ALE . - Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, chers coll\u00e8gues, ch\u00e8re Commission, cher Haut repr\u00e9sentant, il est difficile d\u2019\u00eatre en m\u00eame temps intelligent, d\u2019avoir une ligne de conduite, et difficile \u00e9galement d\u2019\u00eatre confront\u00e9 \u00e0 des interlocuteurs qui, d\u2019un cot\u00e9 comme de l\u2019autre, ne veulent entendre que la moiti\u00e9 de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9.

The user mentioned that the response should only include points attributed to the speaker, and if there are none, just return an empty string.\n\nFirst, I'll check the sections of the debate summary. The Executive Summary covers Javier Solana and Benita Ferrero-Waldner. Then there's a section on Parliamentary Group Positions, which lists PPE-DE, PSE, ALDE, and GUE/NGL. The key dividing lines and innovative proposals are next. \n\nLooking at the Parliamentary Group Positions, the NI group isn't explicitly mentioned here. The groups listed are PPE-DE, PSE, ALDE, and GUE/NGL. The speaker in question is Jan Tadeusz Masiel from NI (Non-Inscribed, which is a group in the European Parliament, sometimes referred to as the \"Non-Inscribed\" or \"NI\" group, which includes members who are not part of any formal political group).\n\nIn the sections provided, the contributions from the different groups are detailed. For example, PPE-DE has Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Salafranca and Elmar Brok. PSE has V\u00e9ronique De Keyser and Emilio Men\u00e9ndez del Valle. ALDE has Annemie Neyts-Uyttebroeck. GUE/NGL has Francis Wurtz. There's also a mention of other speakers like Hannu Takkula, Panagiotis Beglitis, and Richard Howitt in the key dividing lines section. \n\nBut where is Jan Tadeusz Masiel mentioned? The user's query is about a speaker named Jan Tadeusz Masiel (NI). The summary provided doesn't list any contributions from him. The sections under Parliamentary Group Positions don't mention NI. The key dividing lines and innovative proposals also don't reference him. \n\nThe user might have included a speaker who isn't covered in the provided summary. Since the summary doesn't attribute any statements to Jan Tadeusz Masiel, the correct response would be an empty string. I need to confirm that there's no mention of him in any part of the debate summary. \n\nLooking again, the speaker names mentioned are Solana, Ferrero-Waldner, Salafranca, Brok, De Keyser, Men\u00e9ndez del Valle, Neyts-Uyttebroeck, Wurtz, Takkula, Beglitis, Howitt, and Cohn-Bendit. No mention of Jan Tadeusz Masiel. Therefore, there are no points attributed to him in the provided summary.

We can derive two main facts from this description. While Palestinians are governed by Hamas, an organisation that is unwilling to accept the basic principles of international law, the situation in Israel is different. The elections there may yield a government that wants above all to address the social and economic issues that are viewed by all people living in democratic societies as the most important ones for the governments to resolve.\nThis notwithstanding, the European Union faces a daunting challenge.

Let me start by reading through the debate summary again to make sure I don't miss anything.\n\nFirst, the debate was about the situation in the Middle East after the Israeli elections, specifically focusing on Hamas's victory and the new Israeli government under Kadima. The summary mentions different groups: PPE-DE, PSE, ALDE, GUE/NGL, etc. The user is asking about Monika Be\u0148ov\u00e1, who is part of the PSE (Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats). \n\nLooking at the \"Parliamentary Group Positions\" section, under PSE, it says that multiple speakers advocated dialogue with Hamas. Then there's a specific mention of V\u00e9ronique De Keyser arguing the EU \"must hold talks with Hamas, under certain conditions\" and that Hamas maintains its truce and has shown flexibility on a two-state solution. Emilio Men\u00e9ndez del Valle supported engagement based on Hamas officials' peaceful statements to international leaders. \n\nWait, but the user is asking about Monika Be\u0148ov\u00e1, not De Keyser or Men\u00e9ndez del Valle. The problem is, in the provided summary, the only PSE speakers mentioned by name are De Keyser and Men\u00e9ndez del Valle. There's no mention of Monika Be\u0148ov\u00e1 in the summary. The user's query is about her, but the summary doesn't include her contributions. \n\nSo, the user's instruction says that if there are no points attributed to the speaker, I should respond with an empty string. Since the summary doesn't mention Monika Be\u0148ov\u00e1 at all, I need to check again to be sure. Let me scan through the entire summary again.\n\nLooking through the sections: the Executive Summary, then the positions of different groups. Under PSE, the names mentioned are V\u00e9ronique De Keyser and Emilio Men\u00e9ndez del Valle. The rest of the sections like Key Dividing Lines, Innovative Proposals, etc., don't mention Monika Be\u0148ov\u00e1. The speaker list in the debate information says 26 speakers, but the summary only details some of them. \n\nTherefore, based on the given summary, there's no information about Monika Be\u0148ov\u00e1's contributions. The user's instruction is to only include points attributed to the specified speaker. Since there's nothing here, the correct response is an empty string.\n</think>\n\n\"\"\n\nThe provided debate summary does not mention any contributions or arguments made by Monika Be\u0148ov\u00e1 (PSE). The specific points attributed to PSE speakers in the summary are linked to V\u00e9ronique De Keyser and Emilio Men\u00e9ndez del Valle, not Monika Be\u0148ov\u00e1.

It is no coincidence that the political leadership in Israel makes more use of the word 'security' and far less use of the word 'peace', because peace requires negotiation and painful compromises.\nSecurity, on the other hand, is linked to a unilateral determination of the final status of the borders, with maintaining the occupation of East Jerusalem, with the settlements on the West Bank and with the Wall of Shame.\nI believe that Israel's strategic plan, strengthened by the new political situation in the Palestinian territories, is not creating conditions of peace. It is not creating a viable Palestinian state. On the contrary, it is helping to create a virtual state of unconnected areas without stable borders.\nThe European Union is right to lay down terms and conditions for Hamas. However, we do not see the terms and conditions being laid down by the European Union for Israel, because Israel too is flouting the Oslo accords, because Israel too is flouting the terms of the roadmap.\nToday, both Mr Solana and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner broached the question of greater realism on the part of the European Union.

It is no coincidence that the political leadership in Israel makes more use of the word 'security' and far less use of the word 'peace', because peace requires negotiation and painful compromises.\nSecurity, on the other hand, is linked to a unilateral determination of the final status of the borders, with maintaining the occupation of East Jerusalem, with the settlements on the West Bank and with the Wall of Shame.\nI believe that Israel's strategic plan, strengthened by the new political situation in the Palestinian territories, is not creating conditions of peace. It is not creating a viable Palestinian state. On the contrary, it is helping to create a virtual state of unconnected areas without stable borders.\nThe European Union is right to lay down terms and conditions for Hamas. However, we do not see the terms and conditions being laid down by the European Union for Israel, because Israel too is flouting the Oslo accords, because Israel too is flouting the terms of the roadmap.\nToday, both Mr Solana and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner broached the question of greater realism on the part of the European Union.

The text says: \"Panagiotis Beglitis criticized the EU for applying 'conditions only to Hamas while not holding Israel accountable' [Beglitis, 2006-04-05].\" \n\nSo his main argument here is that the EU is being inconsistent by imposing conditions on Hamas but not on Israel. He's pointing out a double standard. The summary doesn't mention any other points from him. The rest of the debate summaries talk about other speakers, but for Beglitis, only this one point is attributed. \n\nI need to make sure there are no other mentions. Scanning through the other sections: under \"Parliamentary Group Positions,\" the PSE section mentions V\u00e9ronique De Keyser and Emilio Men\u00e9ndez del Valle, but not Beglitis. The \"Innovative Proposals\" section mentions Cohn-Bendit. The \"Concluding Assessment\" doesn't attribute anything to Beglitis. \n\nSo the only contribution from Beglitis is the criticism about the EU not holding Israel accountable.

To the Commissioner, I repeat our private discussions that, whilst it is absolutely right for her to put conditions on European aid to the Palestinian Authority, I ask her to develop plans to avoid a humanitarian disaster in the Palestinian territories if Hamas does not move as quickly as we all hope.\nTo Mr Solana, I ask him to consider how easy it was for the Rafah crossing \u2013 supposedly guaranteed by the EU \u2013 to be closed during the recent Israeli actions, together with the legality of Israel withholding customs payments to the Palestinian Authority, guaranteed under the Paris Agreement.

Let me start by reading through the summary carefully.\n\nFirst, the debate was about the situation in the Middle East after the Israeli elections and Hamas's victory. The user mentioned that the answer should only include arguments from Richard Howitt, and not others. The summary has sections on different parliamentary groups, so I need to look for any mentions of Richard Howitt in those sections.\n\nLooking at the \"Key Dividing Lines\" section under \"On Israeli Actions,\" there's a mention of Richard Howitt. The quote says: \"Richard Howitt specifically questioned 'the legality of Israel withholding customs payments to the Palestinian Authority, guaranteed under the Paris Agreement' [Howitt, 2006-04-05].\" \n\nSo, the main point here is that Richard Howitt was questioning the legality of Israel withholding customs payments. The Paris Agreement probably outlines that Israel should transfer these payments, and Howitt is pointing out that Israel isn't complying with that agreement. \n\nI need to make sure there are no other mentions of Richard Howitt in other parts of the summary. Let me check the other sections. The \"Executive Summary\" mentions Benita Ferrero-Waldner and Javier Solana. The \"Parliamentary Group Positions\" section for PSE mentions V\u00e9ronique De Keyser and Emilio Men\u00e9ndez del Valle, but not Howitt. The \"Innovative Proposals\" section mentions Daniel Marc Cohn-Bendit. The \"Concluding Assessment\" doesn't mention specific names. \n\nSo the only direct reference is in the \"Key Dividing Lines\" under \"On Israeli Actions.\" Therefore, the main argument from Richard Howitt is about the legality of Israel withholding customs payments under the Paris Agreement. There's no other information about his arguments in the summary provided. \n\nI need to present this as the only point. The user said if there are no points, respond with an empty string, but here there is one. So the answer should be that Richard Howitt questioned the legality of Israel withholding customs payments to the Palestinian Authority as per the Paris Agreement.\n</think>\n\nRichard Howitt (PSE) specifically questioned \"the legality of Israel withholding customs payments to the Palestinian Authority, guaranteed under the Paris Agreement\" [Howitt, 2006-04-05].", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Edith Mastenbroek (PSE). \u2013", "english": "Edith Mastenbroek (PSE). \u2013 Mr President, I would like to make a few brief points.

Firstly, I should like to thank the many speakers here for their total support for our attempts to continue the peace process. Even in this very difficult time we have to try to do everything we can. However, the primary responsibility rests with the two parties and we \u2013 the international community \u2013 have to support them in following this path. I reiterate that it has to be a negotiated \u2013 not a unilateral \u2013 solution and I think that has been made very clear.\nWe all agree that it is important for Hamas to respect the three conditions; it has to renounce violence, recognise the existence of the State of Israel and stand by existing agreements made by former governments. It is also highly important that the international Quartet remain united. This will not always be easy, but we will try to stay united as much as we can.\nSecondly, humanitarian aid is absolutely necessary. In past analyses we have seen that more or less half of our aid has gone to the various possibilities for humanitarian aid, not through the Palestinian Authority. Therefore this aid will continue through the United Nations organisations and international organisations. We will find ways to do that through NGOs but we will also have to review our position and find some alternative mechanisms. We are working on this. However, since this is a very difficult question, we will have to see precisely what we can do.\nIt also has to be made absolutely sure \u2013 and this is what we have to find out \u2013 that our aid will not go to the terrorists. Therefore, we have to find the right balance, which is not easy.\nNaturally, we also have to support Mahmoud Abbas. He is the interlocutor at present. The possibility is there, so we have to try to reinforce his office as much as we can, but again, please be patient as we are still working on the details.\nRussia has clearly stated that when it met Hamas, it kept within the framework of our Quartet statement of 30\u00a0June. The Russians said it was important to talk with Hamas in order to get it into the right line even before the government was formed. Unfortunately, we have heard that Hamas has not fulfilled all the conditions, although here and there a few first steps have been taken.\nLet me also say a few words on East Jerusalem. We are particularly concerned about settlement activities and the construction of the separation barrier in and around East Jerusalem, which endangers the contiguity of a future Palestinian State and also threatens to vastly complicate the final status negotiations. Any agreement on the city\u2019s status must be negotiated by the two parties and should not be pre-empted by new factors on the ground, as I said before. Statements by the Council and by the Quartet have made that abundantly clear.\nWe are ready to assist the parties as appropriate, if requested. The first step by Israel should be to end discrimination against Palestinians in the cities. There are quite a number of these factors.\nConcerning the separation barrier, the European Union has stated on numerous occasions that, while fully recognising the right of Israel to protect its citizens against terrorist attacks, it is particularly concerned by the route marked out for the separation barrier in the occupied West Bank, which significantly departs from the Green Line, unjustly confiscates Palestinian land and severely curtails movement and access.\nWe again call on Israel to stop and to reverse the construction of the separation barrier inside the occupied Palestinian territories, including in and around East Jerusalem.\n(Applause)", "reconstructed_position": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the main points or arguments made by Benita Ferrero-Waldner in the parliamentary debate summary provided. Let me start by reading through the debate summary again to make sure I don't miss anything.\n\nThe user mentioned that the task is to outline the main points or arguments made by the specified speaker, which in this case is Benita Ferrero-Waldner. The key here is to only include what's attributed to her and not other speakers. The user also said if there are no points, I should return an empty string. \n\nLooking at the debate summary, under the \"Executive Summary\" section, there's a part about \"Commissioner\" which is Benita Ferrero-Waldner. The summary states: \"Benita Ferrero-Waldner (Commissioner) reinforced that 'it has to be a negotiated \u2013 not a unilateral \u2013 solution' [Ferrero-Waldner, 2006-04-05] and confirmed that 'unless the new government complies with the Quartet's conditions, there can be no 'business as usual'' [Ferrero-Waldner, 2006-04-05]. She committed to continuing humanitarian aid through alternative mechanisms while reviewing government assistance.\"\n\nSo from this, the main points are:\n\n1. She emphasized that the solution must be negotiated, not unilateral.\n2. She stated that unless the new government (presumably the Israeli government under Olmert) complies with the Quartet's conditions, there can't be business as usual.\n3. She mentioned continuing humanitarian aid through alternative mechanisms while reviewing government assistance.\n\nI need to make sure these are the only points attributed to her. The rest of the summary talks about other speakers like Javier Solana, Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Salafranca, Elmar Brok, etc., but the user wants only Ferrero-Waldner's contributions. \n\nThe user also mentioned that if there are no points, return an empty string. But here, there are three points. So I should present them clearly, using the exact quotes and the context provided. I should avoid any mention of other speakers or their arguments. \n\nI should check if there's any other mention of her in the summary. The rest of the sections like \"Parliamentary Group Positions\" and \"Key Dividing Lines\" mention other MEPs, but not Ferrero-Waldner. The \"Innovative Proposals\" section mentions Daniel Marc Cohn-Bendit. So the only parts about Ferrero-Waldner are in the Executive Summary under the Commissioner section. \n\nTherefore, the answer should list the three points as outlined. Make sure to use the exact wording from the summary, like \"negotiated \u2013 not a unilateral \u2013 solution\" and the quote about the Quartet's conditions. Also, the part about humanitarian aid through alternative mechanisms and reviewing government assistance. \n\nI think that's all. No other points are attributed to her in the provided summary. So the response should be those three points.\n</think>\n\nBenita Ferrero-Waldner argued that solutions to the Middle East conflict must be \"negotiated \u2013 not a unilateral \u2013 solution\" and emphasized that \"unless the new government complies with the Quartet's conditions, there can be no 'business as usual'.\" She also stated the EU would continue humanitarian aid through \"alternative mechanisms\" while reviewing government assistance.", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Javier Solana,", "english": "Javier Solana, High Representative for the CFSP . Mr President, I would like to remind honourable Members of Parliament that something very important has taken place in these elections. The elections in both Palestine and Israel have created a new political class. The political parties that have dominated life in Israel and Palestine over the last 20 years have disappeared or have come very low in the polls. New parties have appeared that were created only months ago. New people have appeared as leaders. What does that mean? It probably means many things, but at least for us it should mean something new, so far as the leadership is concerned. We have to invest some hope in this movement to see if we can take advantage of the situation to move the process forward.\nI have the impression and the deep conviction that the result of these elections is a profound change in the social structure of both societies. On the part of the Palestinians there is probably no desire to have a non-secular government. I would very much like to insist on that. I do not believe that the majority of people in Palestine voted for Hamas because they wanted a religious government at the head of the Palestinian Authority. I believe they voted against other things that are more closely related to the tyrannies of not doing things properly, of corruption, of a lack of proper organisation.\nWe have to make the effort now to do our utmost to ensure that Palestine, which is probably the most secular part of the Middle East, does not revert to something that probably the majority of Palestinian people do not want. But at the same time there have to be people in government who are able to produce the results that the majority of people want: social services, no corruption, democracy, etc. This is where we have to make our most important impact.\nIt is the same in Jerusalem, the same in Israel. When you see that the Prime Minister is going to be Ehud Olmert and not Mr Sharon, it is really very impressive: what a profound change has taken place in such a short period of time. The person who led Kadima and Likud, the party that has been running affairs in Jerusalem for more than 20 years, is now suffering in hospital. There is a new party with a new leader whom nobody expected to be the leader today.\nNow, does it open possibilities? Let me believe that it opens possibilities. Are we going to use those possibilities? I like to think that, yes, we are going to take advantage of those possibilities. When I talk to Mr Olmert, as I do frequently, I keep telling him unilateralism is not possible. We have seen that already. It was not possible to disengage from Gaza unilaterally. In the end, they first had to call on the international community and then they had to call the Palestinian side, because it is impossible to unravel a situation which is so united and do it unilaterally.\nMr Cohn-Bendit said that it is terrible that avian flu may spread from Israel to Palestine. There has been a statement today saying that we have to make sure that avian flu does not spread from one place to the other. The same person did not say that poverty cannot spread from one to the other; that suffering cannot spread from one to the other. Sometimes, it seems as though we are more concerned about the spread of avian flu and are not really concerned about the suffering, the misery and the tragedy that have existed there for years. The peoples are separated by a barrier, which may not stop avian flu but may stop people going from one place to the other.\n(Applause)\nThat is something really sad. We have to be able to do both things\u00a0\u2013 to cooperate so that avian flu does not spread, and ensure that people can move, workers can move, and progress can be made, and I think that is much more important.\nIn 1980 we said something very important, which has been upheld. Not long ago we said that we believe that the 1967 borders are the starting point for negotiations. I would like to repeat that today in this Parliament. We are ready to defend that; we are ready to accept changes to borders agreed by most people\u00a0\u2013 by both parties. But we cannot imagine any other solution that does not take into consideration the premise that the negotiations have to start around the 1967 borders.\nI should also like to say that everybody has to be given the opportunity to change. Mr Cohn-Bendit has changed. I have changed. How many people in this chamber have changed? And I think we have all changed for the better. Why do we not think that people can change for the better?\nNow we have to give this opportunity, but we have to be very tough until the moment they change. We have to tell them that if they change they will have the opportunity to be part of the team. But, if they do not change, unfortunately they will not be part of it. As I said before, it is very difficult to change the past. Nobody can change his past, only lighten his memories, as many people do. In the future, yes, we can change. We have to act to create the conditions so that people can behave differently in future.\nI would like to see Hamas change and recognise Israel. It is impossible to negotiate if you do not recognise that the other has a right to exist. That has to be reciprocal too. It is impossible to negotiate if you do not want to negotiate and at the same time you want to have a pistol in your pocket. This is not negotiation. That is the type of message we have to get across.\nWe also have to push for plurality in Palestinian society. It has been the most secular society and continues to be secular, not subject to an imposed religious society as has been represented in some Hamas statements. It is a very important point and we have to think about it for the first time. A group that belongs to the Muslim Brothers has arrived in power democratically. We have to think about this because it has happened in Palestine. It may happen in other places, and we have to think about how we are we going to deal with it. I should very much like these elements to be considered not only by think tanks, but also by political players in the European Union.\nI have hope in my heart and I would like you to have hope in your hearts. Together let us see whether we can fulfil the hopes that I am sure you have in your hearts.\n(Applause)", "lang": "EN", "original": "Javier Solana, High Representative for the CFSP .

It is impossible to negotiate if you do not recognise that the other has a right to exist. That has to be reciprocal too. It is impossible to negotiate if you do not want to negotiate and at the same time you want to have a pistol in your pocket. This is not negotiation. That is the type of message we have to get across.\nWe also have to push for plurality in Palestinian society. It has been the most secular society and continues to be secular, not subject to an imposed religious society as has been represented in some Hamas statements. It is a very important point and we have to think about it for the first time. A group that belongs to the Muslim Brothers has arrived in power democratically. We have to think about this because it has happened in Palestine. It may happen in other places, and we have to think about how we are we going to deal with it. I should very much like these elements to be considered not only by think tanks, but also by political players in the European Union.\nI have hope in my heart and I would like you to have hope in your hearts. Together let us see whether we can fulfil the hopes that I am sure you have in your hearts.\n(Applause)", "reconstructed_position": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to outline the main points or arguments made by Javier Solana based on the provided debate summary.

The summary has sections on EU leadership positions, with Javier Solana as the High Representative for CFSP. \n\nLooking at the Executive Summary section under EU Leadership Position, there's a part about Solana. The key points here are that he established the EU's framework with three non-negotiable conditions for Hamas: renouncing violence, recognizing Israel, and respecting previous agreements. The quote provided is \"Hamas cannot change its past, but it can and must change its future.\" Also, he emphasized \"rigour and flexibility\" \u2013 maintaining EU principles while adapting to changes. Additionally, he demanded Israel transfer Palestinian tax revenues, stating \"Israel cannot and must not hold on to this money.\"\n\nNow, the user wants only the points attributed to Javier Solana.
