By 30 April, each Member State must decide whether they are going to open up their labour market or not. This decision will determine whether this year will actually be the year of workers\u2019 mobility, or a parody of it. We cannot tolerate a situation where workers from new Member States continue to be second class, and in certain respects even third class players on the labour market.\nThe free movement of persons is one of the four fundamental freedoms, a fundamental idea of the European Union. In the course of the March summit, the European Heads of State or Government will discuss the Lisbon process. The Lisbon process is bound to fail if we do not create a unified and flexible labour market. And this cannot be achieved without the liberalisation and freedom of the labour market.\nThe Commission has recently published an assessment which showed very clearly that the fears and anxieties persisting in the old Member States are groundless. There have been fears, for a long time, of a massive influx of workforce into Great-Britain, the Republic of Ireland and Sweden, the three countries that have opened up their labour markets. This has not happened. The rate of unemployment has not increased in these countries, against all expectations.\nOn the other hand, \u2018black work\u2019 was reduced, public revenue increased, and the competitiveness of companies has improved. Illegal employment is still considerable in countries that continue to restrict their labour market. This has led the Commission to the unequivocal conclusion that the winners of this process have been the countries that have liberalised the movement of workforce from new Member States.\nSo far I have been talking about the fact that the second class citizens on the labour market are the citizens of the new Member States. However, since 23 January, they have actually become third class citizens in a certain respect, because this was the date when the Directive stating that the European Union shall grant the right to employment and residence to third country nationals who have been residing legally within the territory of the European Union for at least five years came into effect. We do not have any problems with this. But this means that even these nationals are in a more advantageous situation than the workers from new Member States.\nThis is why I ask the Commissioner: how does he envisage the rectification of this problem, how can it be ensured that workers from new Member States do not feel like third class citizens on the labour market? And at this point I would like to welcome the decision of Finland, Spain and Portugal. These are very positive decisions for the liberalisation of the workforce, but we are waiting for France, the Netherlands and Belgium to join in and liberalise their labour markets, as this is in the interest of everybody.", "lang": "HU", "original": "Istv\u00e1n Szent-Iv\u00e1nyi (ALDE), szerz\u0151 . \u2013 Tisztelt Eln\u00f6k \u00dar!

The example given in the problem shows that the response should be based on the speaker's own contributions. The summary mentions that Szent-Iv\u00e1nyi highlighted the contradiction in EU law, where only three countries opened their labor markets, leading to discrimination. \n\nSo, the issue he raised is the discrimination against workers from new Member States. His position is that they are treated as second or third-class. The argument here is the contradiction in EU law and the resulting discrimination. There's no mention of proposals from him, just the problem. The Commission's response is separate, so not included. \n\nI need to structure this into the JSON fields. The issueSum would be about the contradiction and discrimination. PositionSum is his statement on their second-class status. ArgSum would be the reasoning behind his position, which is the legal contradiction.

So I need to check if he made any proposals. Looking back, the key proposals section lists what others called for, but Szent-Iv\u00e1nyi's part doesn't mention any proposals.

Mr President, first of all, the Accession Treaty provides for a nuanced approach and clear solutions which allow both the long-term residents directive and the transitional arrangements for the free movement of workers to be applied in full legal compatibility. Let me explain this in detail.\nFirst of all, there is the question of first-time access to the labour market. In such a case the Accession Treaty \u2013 during any period in which any old Member State applies transitional measures \u2013 provides that it must give preference to nationals of the new Member States over third-country nationals as regards access to the labour market.\nThe second situation concerns nationals from the new Member States who are already resident in an old Member State. In that case the Accession Treaty again provides that nationals of new Member States who already reside and work in a Member State applying transitional measures must not be treated in a more restrictive way than those from third countries also resident and working in that Member State. This means that where by virtue of the directive, a third-country national has been given long-term status, the Accession Treaty operates so as to ensure that the old Member States must treat citizens from new Member States who are already legally resident and working in the territories at least according to the standards guaranteed in the directive \u2013 thus including the right of free access to the labour market.\nThe same logic also applies in the third situation covered by the directive: movement by long-term residents between Member States. Here the rule is the following: workers from a third country who are long-term residents in a new Member State should not be treated more favourably than nationals of that state. In other words, in the situation of mobility to a second Member State, an old Member State cannot give free access to its labour market to a long-term resident who is a third-country-national if and where the same free access is not given to a national of a new Member State. The same applies to equivalent situations between two old Member States. In both cases of mobility between Member States, if both the national of a new-Member-State and the long-term resident are subject to national measures such as a work permit, Community preference would operate in favour of the national of the new Member State, who is a European citizen.\nFrom the above, it results that the rights provided by the directive can be reconciled with the provisions of the Accession Treaty.

The summary states that he maintained existing legal frameworks prevented discrimination, saying it's impossible to have less favorable treatment for new member states. He proposed clarification letters instead of new legislation.\n\nSo, the key issue here is the Commission's stance on discrimination and transition periods. His position is that current laws are sufficient. The arguments he used are that the existing framework prevents discrimination. The proposals he made are clarification letters rather than new legislation.\n\nI need to make sure not to include other speakers' points. The user specified that only the speaker's own contributions should be included. Since Frattini's response is brief in the summary, the points are limited.

The question concerns the issue of the free movement of workers from new Member States, and seeks an answer to whether, within the current regulation frameworks, certain groups of non-EU nationals are enjoying considerably more advantages than citizens of new Member States in respect of movement between Member States for employment purposes. If this were true, then this situation would be obviously wrong, and we would have to rectify it, to avoid any prejudice to the preference principle stipulated in the status quo clause of the Accession Treaty.\nHowever, Article 21 of Directive 2003/109/EC stipulates that third country nationals who have obtained long-term residence permits in a second Member State shall have access to the labour market. The expression \u2018shall have' must be interpreted to mean that the issue of a work permit cannot be denied if the persons concerned have already obtained the right to long-term residence.\nConsequently, a long-term residence permit issued in the second Member State practically includes the work permit. This means that if companies in the target state are willing to accept them, the access to the labour market of non-EU nationals arriving from other Member States is automatic and unrestrictable, while the access of citizens from new Member States is unequivocally restricted and restrictable.\nWe must obviously welcome an objective that aims to achieve greater mobility and a more flexible and more unified labour market. This is the obvious aim of Directive 2003/109/EC, too, but attention must be paid to the right sequence.

Let us hope that it ends as soon as possible, so that all Europeans may be equal and so that we may make the mobility of workers an important tool in terms of our competitiveness, our employment and the construction of the European Union.\nI would therefore like to join with those people who are calling for an open door policy, and the sooner the better, and in this regard I believe \u2014 and, as a Spaniard, I am pleased about this \u2014 that my country\u2019s government\u2019s announcement that the restrictions during this transition period are to be lifted is very important.\nWe have done this, Commissioner, because we are a country with a degree of experience, being a country of immigration and one of emigration. Furthermore, we have seen clearly once again over these two years that these restrictions imposed on the countries of Central and Eastern Europe by the Europe of 15 must be lifted, for reasons of justice and solidarity, but also for reasons of rationality and common sense, today more than ever, in this year of mobility.\nWe must firstly look at this from the point of view of justice and solidarity. We Spaniards also had a seven-year transition period and we felt humiliated and unfairly treated as a result of a situation that was not justified, because it became clear that many of those xenophobic and racist arguments were mistaken. There was no avalanche of workers. Spanish workers never created problems in the host countries; on the contrary.\nWe have seen the same thing happening over the last two years with the workers of the new Member States: not only have they not created problems, but they are in fact resolving labour shortages, improving their skills and enhancing the global concept of Europe.\nWhat I would ask, therefore, is that the study carried out by the European Commission should serve to persuade more countries to lift the restrictions and that the day should come when Europe is genuinely a Europe in which all European citizens and all European workers have the same rights, because that would be consistent, because it would be very good for mobility and because Europe needs mobility if it wants to win the productivity and competitiveness battle with the United States.\nWe need to create that great market of free citizens in which there will be no problems and which, furthermore, will enable us to improve our competitiveness, to improve our capacity and to improve the lives of our citizens, so that, as well as resolving specific problems, we may create something of a vision for the future in terms of removing those obstacles.", "lang": "ES", "original": "Alejandro Cercas, en nombre del Grupo del PSE . \u2013 (ES) Se\u00f1or Presidente, se\u00f1or Comisario, creo que, sin dem\u00e9rito de las respuestas a lo que ocurre o de las interpretaciones de la Directiva, esta tambi\u00e9n es una buena ocasi\u00f3n para levantar la voz, y yo uno la m\u00eda a la de los que piensan que este problema no se va a resolver hasta que terminemos definitivamente con este periodo transitorio, que ojal\u00e1 termine cuanto antes, para que todos los europeos seamos iguales y hagamos de la movilidad de los trabajadores una importante herramienta para nuestra competitividad, para nuestro empleo y para la construcci\u00f3n de la Uni\u00f3n Europea.\nPor eso, me uno a los que piden una pol\u00edtica de puertas abiertas, cuanto antes mejor, y creo que, en este sentido, es muy interesante \u2014y, como espa\u00f1ol, me felicito por ello\u2014 el anuncio que ha hecho el Gobierno de mi pa\u00eds de levantar las restricciones que hab\u00eda en este periodo transitorio.\nY lo hemos hecho, se\u00f1or Comisario, porque somos un pa\u00eds con una cierta experiencia, por ser pa\u00eds de inmigraci\u00f3n y pa\u00eds de emigraci\u00f3n.

It is the countries that continue to protect their markets that have to explain why they continue to deny fully-paid-up fellow EU citizens their basic rights. It also makes good economic sense, of course, to lift the restrictions.\nThe European economy and the labour market need people. If we, in the European Union and its internal market, want to compete with major markets outside Europe, we will need dynamic, young, well-trained people who are also mobile. That is something to which we have always aspired within the European economy, and so it makes no sense whatsoever to keep the labour markets closed off. Moreover, it is an illusion that these restrictions stop Eastern European workers from coming over here, for they have been around for a long time, even though they are being exploited by fraudulent employers and live in degrading circumstances in our countries \u2013 something that I regard as a disgrace.\nConsiderations of civil rights, the economy and solidarity therefore require that the restrictions be lifted.

As a result, higher wages come under even more pressure. Unlike in the case of legitimate employment, illegal employment is not capable of being controlled and monitored. That results in workers being subjected to exploitation and discrimination.\nWhat is needed in Europe is a well-ordered labour market with minimum standards and underpinned by the principle of the same pay for the same work in the same place.

On the one hand, the countries of the so-called old Fifteen are bound to ensure that long-term residents receive the same treatment as their own nationals as regards access to the labour market. On the other, many of these same countries are taking advantage of the provisions of the Treaty on Accession and maintaining the ban on free movement of workers where the new Ten are concerned. This state of affairs is contrary to the provisions of the aforementioned Treaty on Accession, pursuant to which European Union citizens have priority over third country nationals regarding access to the labour market. The problem could have been resolved by doing away with the transitional periods for the employment of citizens of the new Member States in the labour markets of the old Union. Unfortunately, only three Member States, namely Ireland, Sweden and the United Kingdom opened up their labour markets from 1\u00a0May\u00a02004. Two other Member States, Spain and Portugal, have stated that they will do so from 1\u00a0May of this year. Sadly, in most of the other Member States fear of the anticipated influx of cheap foreign labour and consequent loss of jobs has won the day. Mrs\u00a0Schroedter mentioned this in the case of Germany. Such fear is entirely groundless. The European Commission\u2019s statistics show that in most countries the number of citizens of the new Member States employed has remained fairly stable before and after enlargement. With the exception of Austria, the figure for workers from the 10\u00a0new Member States employed has not exceeded 1% of the economically active population. In no Member State of the Union has it been the case that the influx of workers from the new Member States has ousted local workers from their jobs. The new arrivals have been taking completely new jobs or previously unfilled positions.\nMr\u00a0President, we need to realise that the US economy will continue to outstrip ours in terms of competitiveness unless we increase the mobility of the labour force in Europe. Unemployment in the EU currently stands at over 8% but even so, there is a shortage of workers in certain areas. Meanwhile, not all Europeans can move freely in search of work. Regrettably, it is very likely that the greater part of the Union\u2019s labour market will remain closed to citizens of the new Member States for a further five years. That is why it is essential for the European Commission to take action to eliminate the contradictions in Union legislation and to extend the free movement of workers.", "lang": "PL", "original": "Adam Jerzy Bielan, w imieniu grupy UEN . \u2013 Panie Przewodnicz\u0105cy!

I called on them to open up their labour markets to citizens of the new Member States. Unfortunately, only three Member States were courageous enough to open up their labour markets at that time. I refer to the United Kingdom, Ireland and Sweden. The remaining 12\u00a0Member States gave in to the fears or maybe even the pressures of their own public opinion and citizens and barricaded themselves against an influx of workers from the new Member States, especially from Central and Eastern Europe. What conclusions can be drawn after these two years? Clearly, those who have benefited the most are the very same three countries that dared to open their labour markets.\nThe European Commission communication issued about a month ago, in February if I am not mistaken, makes it very clear that unemployment has not increased in countries that decided to open their labour markets. Social problems have not either. What has happened is quite the opposite. The economy has gathered additional pace, and income from taxation has increased. Such are the benefits of the practical implementation of one of the fundamental principles of the Treaty. It could even be deemed the most fundamental of them all. It is part of the foundations upon which the Union is built, and we should be striving to implement it across the 25\u00a0current Members of the European Union.\nOn the eve of the expiry of the first transitional period I am delighted that a couple more governments are reconsidering opening their labour markets. It must however be pointed out that the way things stand, they still constitute a minority of the old Fifteen. This is a serious problem, and I should like to send out the following appeal. As we each take the floor in the near future to debate Parliament\u2019s resolution, we should send out a clear call to the governments of Member States not simply to consider opening up their labour markets.

The user provided a debate summary about free movement of workers and transition periods, specifically focusing on Jacek Protasiewicz from the PPE-DE group. They want me to extract the main points from his speech, following the structure of the example response.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the debate summary and find any mentions of Jacek Protasiewicz. Looking at the \"Executive Summary\" section under \"Arguments for Lifting Restrictions,\" there's a part where Jacek Protasiewicz is mentioned. The summary states that he emphasized that \"unemployment has not increased in countries that decided to open their labour markets. Social problems have not either. What has happened is quite the opposite.\"\n\nSo, the key issue here is the impact of lifting labor market restrictions. His position is in favor of ending transition periods, as he's part of the majority supporting that. The argument he presents is based on the evidence that opening markets didn't lead to increased unemployment or social problems, which counters concerns about negative effects. The proposal he might be supporting is the lifting of restrictions, but the summary doesn't mention any specific proposals from him beyond his argument. \n\nI need to make sure I don't include other speakers' points. The user specified that only the speaker's own contributions should be included. Since the example response includes \"issueSum,\" \"positionSum,\" \"argSum,\" and \"propSum,\" I'll structure each accordingly. \n\nFor \"issueSum,\" it's about the labor market restrictions and their effects. \"positionSum\" would be his support for lifting restrictions based on his argument. The argument is the evidence about unemployment and social problems. There's no specific proposal mentioned from him, so \"propSum\" might be empty, but the example includes a propSum even if it's a general call. Wait, in the example, the propSum was \"He advocates for strict limitations on government demands for private data,\" which is a proposal. However, in the debate summary, Jacek's contribution is an argument, not a specific proposal. The key proposals mentioned in the summary are from the speakers in general, like lifting restrictions, but the user wants only what's attributed to Jacek. Since the summary doesn't mention any specific proposal from him, maybe \"propSum\" is empty. But the example includes a propSum even if it's part of the position. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking back, the user's instruction says: \"You will outline the main points or arguments made by that speaker.\" So if the speaker didn't make a proposal, then propSum would be empty. In the case of Jacek Protasiewicz, the summary only mentions his argument about unemployment and social problems. There's no mention of a specific proposal from him. Therefore, propSum would be an empty string. But the example given by the user includes a propSum. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example response, the propSum is \"He advocates for strict limitations on government demands for private data,\" which is a proposal. However, in the debate summary provided, Jacek's contribution is an argument, not a proposal. So perhaps in this case, propSum is empty. But the user's example might have a different structure. Wait, the user's example is just an example, not the actual data. So I need to stick to the provided debate summary.\n\nSo, for Jacek Protasiewicz:\n\nissueSum: The issue is the impact of lifting labor market restrictions, specifically regarding unemployment and social problems.\n\npositionSum: His position is in favor of lifting restrictions, as he argues that opening labor markets didn't cause negative effects.\n\nargSum: The argument is that unemployment and social problems didn't increase in countries that opened their markets, implying that restrictions are unnecessary.\n\npropSum: There's no specific proposal mentioned from him, so it's empty.\n\nBut the user's example includes a propSum even if it's part of the position. Wait, in the example, the propSum is a proposal, but in the debate summary, the speaker's contribution is an argument. So maybe in this case, propSum is empty. However, the user's instructions say that if there are no points, respond with an empty string. So I need to check if the debate summary mentions any proposals from Jacek. \n\nLooking back, the \"Key Proposals\" section mentions that speakers called for immediate lifting of restrictions, etc., but it's not attributed to Jacek specifically. Therefore, propSum would be empty. So the final JSON would have:\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The key issue relates to the effects of lifting labor market restrictions on unemployment and social problems.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"He supports the lifting of labor market restrictions, arguing that countries opening their markets did not experience increased unemployment or social issues.\",\n\"argSum\": \"His argument is based on evidence that unemployment and social problems have not increased in countries that opened their labor markets, indicating that restrictions are unnecessary.\",\n\"propSum\": \"\"\n}\n\nBut I need to make sure the JSON is correctly formatted. Also, check for any other mentions of Jacek. The summary only mentions him once, so that's all.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The key issue relates to the effects of labor market restrictions on unemployment and social problems.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"He supports the lifting of labor market restrictions, arguing that countries opening their markets did not experience increased unemployment or social issues.\",\n\"argSum\": \"His argument is based on evidence that unemployment and social problems have not increased in countries that opened their labor markets, indicating that restrictions are unnecessary.\",\n\"propSum\": \"\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Csaba S\u00e1ndor Tabajdi (PSE).", "english": "Csaba S\u00e1ndor Tabajdi (PSE). \u2013 (HU) Mr President, I would like to thank my colleague, Istv\u00e1n Szent-Iv\u00e1nyi, for the inclusion of this topic on the agenda once more; this is not only important to the Member States, but to all of Europe. I would like to thank Commissioner Vladimir Spidla, who has prepared an excellent summarising report, presenting an accurate and authentic picture of the labour market processes in the past period.\nThe aim of Hungary and of the other new Member States is to see that all legal and administrative obstacles currently hindering the free movement of workers in the European Union are lifted. We would like to be equal citizens of the European Union. Opening up the labour market and ensuring the free movement of workers is not a gift or a favour, but the reasonable decision of the nine old Member States, which would have beneficial effects on all the citizens of the European Union.\nIt is the competitiveness of the European Union that is at stake. I hope that nine old Member States will realise this, and that in April 2006, at the end of the two-year transitional period, the remaining nine Member States will also make a favourable decision, joining Finland, Spain and Portugal, who are opening up their market now.\nWe must thank the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland and Sweden, who were the first to open their market. This step has brought a significant advantage to these countries. In the Republic of Ireland, the rate of unemployment has fallen in the past two years, partly due to the positive effects created by workers from new Member States. In the United Kingdom, the influx of workers contributed to economic growth and an improvement in competitiveness. Consequently, the accusations and fears related to mass immigration and social dumping are simply unfounded.\nMany thanks to Finland, Spain and Portugal, who have announced that they, too, are opening their labour market.\nIt is highly hypocritical that the nine old Member States who are not lifting their restrictions are allowing the entry of workforce from non-European Union countries, but refuse to allow entry to workers from the new Member States. At this late hour I need to argue with Commissioner Frattini. What he has said is only true in the countries that have opened their labour market. In those countries it is, indeed, possible to give priority to workers from new Member States over workers from third countries. In countries that have not opened their labour market, this issue does not even arise. Therefore, opening the labour markets is a matter of principle, of competitiveness and of eliminating discrimination, as well as a matter of equality between the fifteen old and the ten new Member States.", "lang": "HU", "original": "Csaba S\u00e1ndor Tabajdi (PSE). \u2013 Tisztelt Eln\u00f6k \u00dar!

The user wants me to outline the main points made by Csaba S\u00e1ndor Tabajdi in the given debate summary. First, I need to read through the provided debate summary carefully.\n\nThe debate is about free movement of workers and transition periods for new EU member states. The speaker in question is Csaba S\u00e1ndor Tabajdi from the PSE group. The user's example response structure is JSON with four fields: issueSum, positionSum, argSum, propSum.\n\nLooking at the debate summary, under the \"Key Proposals\" section, it mentions that speakers called for immediate lifting of restrictions, unified labor markets, Commission enforcement, and equal pay. However, the user wants only the points attributed to Tabajdi. \n\nIn the \"Political Implications\" section, it says: \"Toomas Hendrik Ilves condemned 'neo-protectionism creating second and third-class citizens,' while Csaba S\u00e1ndor Tabajdi declared: 'We would like to be equal citizens of the European Union.' This sentiment was echoed across party lines...\" \n\nSo Tabajdi's main point is about equality for new member states, wanting to be equal citizens. The summary doesn't mention any other specific arguments or proposals from him. The other parts of the summary talk about other speakers' points, but the user specified to only include what's attributed to Tabajdi.\n\nTherefore, the issueSum would relate to the equality of citizens. The positionSum is his declaration about wanting equal citizenship. There's no explicit argument given for why he holds that position, and no specific proposals beyond that statement. The example response includes \"argSum\" even if it's brief, so maybe I need to infer based on the context. But the user's instruction says to only include points attributed to the speaker. Since the summary doesn't provide arguments or proposals from Tabajdi beyond his statement, the argSum and propSum might be empty. However, the example response includes \"argSum\" even if it's a single sentence. \n\nWait, in the example given, the user's example response has \"argSum\" as a justification. But in the debate summary, Tabajdi's statement is a position, not an argument. The user's instruction says to include arguments used to justify positions. However, the summary doesn't mention any arguments from Tabajdi. So maybe those fields are empty. \n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nissueSum: The key issue is the desire for equal citizenship for new EU member states.\npositionSum: He declared that they want to be equal citizens of the EU.\nargSum: There's no specific argument mentioned for his position in the summary.\npropSum: No specific proposals mentioned beyond the general call for equality.\n\nBut the user's example has \"argSum\" even if it's a single sentence. However, in this case, the summary doesn't provide arguments from Tabajdi. So the correct approach is to leave those fields empty if there's no information. \n\nTherefore, the JSON should have:\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The key issue relates to the desire for equal citizenship and treatment of workers from new EU Member States.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"He declared that new Member States should be treated as equal citizens of the European Union.\",\n\"argSum\": \"\",\n\"propSum\": \"\"\n}\n\nBut I need to check if there's any other mention. The summary says he echoed the sentiment across party lines, but that's not his own argument. So yes, only the position and issue. The example response includes \"argSum\" even if it's a single sentence, but here, there's no argument provided. So the answer should reflect that.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The key issue relates to the desire for equal citizenship and treatment of workers from new EU Member States.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"He declared that new Member States should be treated as equal citizens of the European Union.\",\n\"argSum\": \"\",\n\"propSum\": \"\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "\u0160ar\u016bnas Birutis (ALDE).", "english": "\u0160ar\u016bnas Birutis (ALDE). \u2013 (LT) What more can I add to the comments made by all those colleagues who spoke before me? The free movement of persons is one of the fundamental freedoms which is guaranteed, but as yet only declared in European Community law. The new Member States expect the European Union's old-timers to open their labour markets to the newcomers as soon as possible, believing that the old-timers will only benefit from this, although it is the sovereign right of each one of the old Member States to do this before it actually becomes compulsory. According to European Commission statistics, the flood of labour from the new countries was not as great as had been threatened. Having admitted workers from the new members, England, Ireland and Sweden only benefited. We must congratulate several states on their decision to open their labour market to the new members of the European Union from May. The free movement of labour, the liberalisation of the services market and other measures would contribute to the competitiveness of the European Union, and moreover, it would increase citizens' faith in European Union membership. The clarity or ambiguity of a complicated situation reduces faith in the European Union. In my opinion, members of the European Union must take measures to immediately abolish discriminatory restrictions to legal employment faced by the citizens of Lithuania and other new Member States. This would allow people to truly benefit from their rights and would give them the opportunity to pay taxes legally.

One example is the services market, and the labour market could serve as another.\nFrom 23\u00a0January, following final implementation of the directive concerning residents, the situation regarding access to the labour market by third-country citizens may actually be better than that of citizens of the countries that recently joined the Union.

My task is to extract the main points, positions, arguments, and proposals made by him, without including others.\n\nFirst, I need to check the debate summary to see if Othmar Karas is mentioned. The summary mentions 18 MEPs and one Commission response. The core issue is about transition periods for new EU members. The arguments for lifting restrictions are economic benefits, fundamental rights, and practical ineffectiveness. The Commission's response is mentioned, and there's opposition from Harald Ettl. The key proposals include lifting restrictions, unified labor markets, enforcement of anti-discrimination, and equal pay.\n\nNow, looking for Othmar Karas. The user's example response includes issues, positions, arguments, and proposals. But in the provided debate summary, the speaker name is Othmar Karas (PPE-DE). However, in the actual debate summary given, the names of the speakers aren't listed. The summary mentions various MEPs like Istv\u00e1n Szent-Iv\u00e1nyi, Alejandro Cercas, Jacek Protasiewicz, etc., but not Othmar Karas. The user might have made a mistake here, or perhaps Othmar Karas is mentioned in the actual debate but not in the summary provided.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says that the debate summary is given, and the speaker's name is Othmar Karas. But in the provided summary, there's no mention of Othmar Karas. The summary lists other speakers but not him.

No Othmar Karas. The user might have a typo or mistake. However, the user's instruction says that the speaker's name is Othmar Karas, but the debate summary provided doesn't mention him. Therefore, the correct response would be an empty JSON because there are no points attributed to Othmar Karas in the given summary.\n\nBut wait, maybe the user is testing if I can handle such cases. The instructions say, \"If this is the case, respond with an empty string.\" So the JSON should be empty. However, the example response provided by the user has entries.

This matter is meant to be handled by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, but this debate, and the question on this point, are pre-empting its deliberations, and that I really do think is something we can do without; there may be reasons for it, but it is, I think, something we can do without.\nLet me start by saying that the Commission communication, which is meant to help do away with the transitional period for the free movement of workers, is, I think, still defective in terms of its substance and \u2013 in the form in which it is presented to us \u2013 not yet watertight in economic terms. Nor are the authors of today\u2019s question looking at the facts from the right angle when they talk in terms of the citizens of the ten new Member States being put at a disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis the nationals of third countries. The fact is that, in Germany, people from the ten new Member States are 3% more likely to be in work than those from third states. In Austria, the difference stands as high as 6%. The advantage enjoyed by the ten new States is even more pronounced in Great Britain and Ireland. More to the point, data relating to only one year since accession cannot serve as a credible basis for a prognosis of medium and long-term changes in the labour market of the kind that the Commission is putting forward.\nWhen one considers the period to which the evaluation refers, the conclusion at which the communication arrives, namely that the opening-up of the labour market has a positive effect on economic growth and employment, is quite simply wrong. In 2005, there was markedly less economic growth in the EU of 25 than in 2004. This was particularly the case in the United Kingdom, where there was a 1.4% decline and where immigration was ten times greater than the British Government had predicted. In contrast to preceding years, there was also scarcely any reduction in unemployment, and so I call on the Commission to commission, as soon as possible, a study examining worker migration and all the effects associated with it, and doing so in a value-free way.\nThat will be beneficial not only to the Commission, but also in terms of continued rational dialogue. I would add that, while I too would like to see an early reduction in the transitional periods, that will require good accompanying measures in a suitable framework, and the revision of the Posting of Workers Directive. That would be to the benefit of all concerned, in that it would allay one side\u2019s fears and concerns, and make both sides better able to engage in dialogue, but the sort of debate we are having today I regard, quite simply, as wrong.", "lang": "DE", "original": "Harald Ettl (PSE). \u2013 Herr Pr\u00e4sident! Wenn das Aufeinanderzugehen manchmal nicht sprachlich schon so schwierig w\u00e4re \u2013 es hat schon seinen Sinn im Europ\u00e4ischen Parlament, dass wir Kommissionsberichte in den zust\u00e4ndigen Aussch\u00fcssen bearbeiten, dar\u00fcber befinden und dar\u00fcber diskutieren. In diesem Fall, wo der Besch\u00e4ftigungsausschuss daf\u00fcr zust\u00e4ndig ist, haben wir heute eine vorgezogene Diskussion und eine vorgezogene Anfrage zu diesem Punkt. Das halte ich im wahrsten Sinne des Wortes f\u00fcr entbehrlich. Es mag Gr\u00fcnde daf\u00fcr geben, aber ich halte es f\u00fcr entbehrlich.\nVorweg. Die Mitteilung der Kommission, die helfen soll, die \u00dcbergangsfrist f\u00fcr den freien Arbeitnehmerverkehr rasch zu beseitigen, halte ich f\u00fcr inhaltlich noch mangelhaft und \u00f6konomisch \u2013 wie pr\u00e4sentiert \u2013 noch nicht f\u00fcr schl\u00fcssig. Die heutigen Anfragesteller, die von einer Benachteiligung der B\u00fcrger der 10 neuen Mitgliedstaaten (EU-10) gegen\u00fcber Angeh\u00f6rigen aus Drittstaaten sprechen, haben sich die Faktenlage ebenfalls nicht richtig angesehen. Faktum ist, dass in Deutschland Personen aus der EU-10 eine um 3\u00a0% h\u00f6here Besch\u00e4ftigungsquote aufweisen als Drittstaatangeh\u00f6rige. In \u00d6sterreich liegt diese Differenz sogar bei 6\u00a0%. Noch extremer verh\u00e4lt es sich in Gro\u00dfbritannien und in Irland zu Gunsten der EU-10. Dar\u00fcber hinaus kann mit Daten von nur einem Jahr seit dem Beitritt noch keine mittel- und langfristige Entwicklung am Arbeitsmarkt, wie von der Kommission dargestellt, seri\u00f6s prognostiziert werden.\nDie Schlussfolgerung in der Mitteilung, dass die \u00d6ffnung des Arbeitsmarktes positiv auf Wirtschaftswachstum und Besch\u00e4ftigung wirkt, ist bezogen auf den Bewertungszeitraum einfach falsch. Das Wirtschaftswachstum in der EU-25 ist im Jahr 2005 gegen\u00fcber 2004 deutlich zur\u00fcckgegangen. Insbesondere in Gro\u00dfbritannien, wo der R\u00fcckgang 1,4\u00a0% betrug und wo es zu einer zehnmal so hohen Zuwanderung gekommen ist, wie von der britischen Regierung prognostiziert. Im Gegensatz zu den vorangegangenen Jahren ist es auch zu beinahe keinem R\u00fcckgang der Arbeitslosigkeit mehr gekommen. Ich fordere daher die Kommission auf, rasch eine Studie in Auftrag zu geben, die die Wanderungsbewegungen der Arbeitnehmer und alle damit verbundenen Auswirkungen wertfrei analysiert.\nDas ist nicht nur gut f\u00fcr die Kommission, das ist gut f\u00fcr einen weiteren sinnvollen Dialog. Im \u00dcbrigen ben\u00f6tigt die rasche Reduktion der \u00dcbergangsfristen \u2013 und das w\u00fcnsche ich mir auch \u2013 ein gutes Begleitkonzept und gute Begleitma\u00dfnahmen wie z.\u00a0B. die Revision der Entsenderichtlinie.

The core issue is about free movement of workers and transition periods for new EU member states. Most speakers supported lifting restrictions, but Harald Ettl was an opponent. \n\nLooking at the \"Opposition and Concerns\" section, it says Ettl expressed significant reservations. He argued the Commission's analysis was \"defective in terms of its substance\" and called for a comprehensive, value-free study before reducing transition periods. \n\nSo, the key points from Ettl are his opposition to lifting restrictions, his criticism of the Commission's analysis, and his call for more study. The other sections like economic benefits or fundamental rights aren't his points. \n\nNow, structuring the JSON. The issueSum should mention his concern about the Commission's analysis. PositionSum would be his reservation and call for study. ArgSum is based on his claim that the analysis is defective.

No transition periods will stop a person who wants to leave. A person's freedom of movement is the cornerstone value of the European Community.

It is good news that Finland, Spain and Portugal plan to abandon the transition period. Austria and Germany initiated the introduction of the transition periods.

The issue here is the restriction on labor markets for new EU members. Her position is that freedom of movement is fundamental. The argument is that it's a core value, and there's no mention of specific proposals from her. The summary doesn't list any proposals from her, only her position and the argument based on it.

It was feared that the new Member States would start to offer services of a better quality than in the old Member States, and this resulted in the blocking of the implementation of one of Europe\u2019s fundamental rights, which for fifty years had only existed on paper. There was offensive talk of the movement of services constituting \u2018social dumping\u2019, and the mythical plombier polonais was invoked to frighten citizens of the old Member States. This rhetoric humiliated the new Member States and left their citizens with the impression that they were not human beings. The conflict was not, however, between left-wing and right-wing forces, and the old Member States quickly found a compromise among themselves: some defended their large companies, while others protected their trade unions. But Eastern Europe opened up its market long before it joined the European Union, and as a result large companies from the old Member States have for years simply bought up companies in Eastern Europe without the constraints of a services directive. They came to our market and bought it, but when our turn came, the door was closed. It is the small companies and citizens of the new Member States, as well as consumers in the old Member States, who suffer as a result of this.\nSecondly, the restriction of the free movement of labour makes the new Europeans into second-class citizens. Some citizens of the EU are entitled to move freely, while others are not \u2013 on the basis of their citizenship. Neo-protectionism in the EU limits the civil rights of citizens of the new Member States, often using xenophobic rhetoric, as we noticed in the case of the debating of the Services Directive. Although the labour market is closed, the old Member States have for years gladly picked out those workers they lack \u2013 for instance, doctors, nurses and IT specialists. They would not consider insulting these workers by branding them with the label of dumping, because their recruitment is often even funded by state subsidy.\nThirdly, we have now seen the implementation of a directive stipulating that non-citizens who have lived in an EU Member State for five years are entitled to freedom of movement, but citizens of the new EU Member States lack that right. What can one conclude from this? Citizens of the new Member States are not only second-class, but even third-class citizens.\nMy question is this: what action does Europe plan to take to ensure that this intolerable protectionism and obvious discrimination does not split the newly reunited Europe?", "lang": "ET", "original": "Toomas Hendrik Ilves (PSE). \u2013 Ma k\u00fcsiksin laiemalt \u2013 miks tunnevad uued liikmesriigid, et l\u00f5he nende ja vanade vahel aina s\u00fcveneb?\nAlustaksin teenuste direktiiviga.

Migrant workers have helped eliminate labour market deficiencies, increasing the skilled labour force in the EU, decreasing the potential for illegal employment, and contributing overall to better efficiency in Europe.\nA month ago we debated and approved in the first reading a report on opening the services market in the European Union. I am mentioning the Services Directive because a point may come when it will touch closely on the freedom of movement for workers. A critical moment could be reached if, on the one hand, the Services Directive becomes effective and, on the other hand, a country still chooses to frustrate the free movement of workers. This would impose constraints on workers in their desire to switch employers, even though such changes would benefit not only themselves but also the destination country. A country may eliminate this risk by cancelling the transition period.\nLadies and gentlemen, in itself the free movement of workers is, of course, not a solution for sustaining the social model of a given state. Inefficient models cannot be sustained in the face of the deteriorating public finance deficits that result from globalisation, technological change and ageing populations. The free movement of workers, however, is definitely not, and cannot be, the source of these problems. European legislation cannot dictate to the Member States whether they should or should not cancel transition periods.
