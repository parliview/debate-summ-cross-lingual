This decision will determine whether this year will actually be the year of workers\u2019 mobility, or a parody of it. We cannot tolerate a situation where workers from new Member States continue to be second class, and in certain respects even third class players on the labour market.\nThe free movement of persons is one of the four fundamental freedoms, a fundamental idea of the European Union. In the course of the March summit, the European Heads of State or Government will discuss the Lisbon process. The Lisbon process is bound to fail if we do not create a unified and flexible labour market. And this cannot be achieved without the liberalisation and freedom of the labour market.\nThe Commission has recently published an assessment which showed very clearly that the fears and anxieties persisting in the old Member States are groundless. There have been fears, for a long time, of a massive influx of workforce into Great-Britain, the Republic of Ireland and Sweden, the three countries that have opened up their labour markets. This has not happened. The rate of unemployment has not increased in these countries, against all expectations.\nOn the other hand, \u2018black work\u2019 was reduced, public revenue increased, and the competitiveness of companies has improved. Illegal employment is still considerable in countries that continue to restrict their labour market. This has led the Commission to the unequivocal conclusion that the winners of this process have been the countries that have liberalised the movement of workforce from new Member States.\nSo far I have been talking about the fact that the second class citizens on the labour market are the citizens of the new Member States. However, since 23 January, they have actually become third class citizens in a certain respect, because this was the date when the Directive stating that the European Union shall grant the right to employment and residence to third country nationals who have been residing legally within the territory of the European Union for at least five years came into effect. We do not have any problems with this. But this means that even these nationals are in a more advantageous situation than the workers from new Member States.\nThis is why I ask the Commissioner: how does he envisage the rectification of this problem, how can it be ensured that workers from new Member States do not feel like third class citizens on the labour market? And at this point I would like to welcome the decision of Finland, Spain and Portugal.

It is the countries that continue to protect their markets that have to explain why they continue to deny fully-paid-up fellow EU citizens their basic rights.

If we, in the European Union and its internal market, want to compete with major markets outside Europe, we will need dynamic, young, well-trained people who are also mobile. That is something to which we have always aspired within the European economy, and so it makes no sense whatsoever to keep the labour markets closed off. Moreover, it is an illusion that these restrictions stop Eastern European workers from coming over here, for they have been around for a long time, even though they are being exploited by fraudulent employers and live in degrading circumstances in our countries \u2013 something that I regard as a disgrace.\nConsiderations of civil rights, the economy and solidarity therefore require that the restrictions be lifted.

Integendeel, het zijn de landen die hun markten blijven afschermen die moeten uitleggen waarom ze volwaardige mede-EU-burgers hun elementaire rechten blijven ontzeggen.

Als wij als Europese Unie en als interne markt willen concurreren met grote markten buiten Europa, dan hebben we dynamische, jonge, goed opgeleide mensen nodig die mobiel zijn. Dat is waar we altijd naar gestreefd hebben binnen de Europese economie. Dus het dichthouden van de arbeidsmarkten is absoluut onzinnig.

On the one hand, the countries of the so-called old Fifteen are bound to ensure that long-term residents receive the same treatment as their own nationals as regards access to the labour market. On the other, many of these same countries are taking advantage of the provisions of the Treaty on Accession and maintaining the ban on free movement of workers where the new Ten are concerned. This state of affairs is contrary to the provisions of the aforementioned Treaty on Accession, pursuant to which European Union citizens have priority over third country nationals regarding access to the labour market. The problem could have been resolved by doing away with the transitional periods for the employment of citizens of the new Member States in the labour markets of the old Union. Unfortunately, only three Member States, namely Ireland, Sweden and the United Kingdom opened up their labour markets from 1\u00a0May\u00a02004. Two other Member States, Spain and Portugal, have stated that they will do so from 1\u00a0May of this year. Sadly, in most of the other Member States fear of the anticipated influx of cheap foreign labour and consequent loss of jobs has won the day. Mrs\u00a0Schroedter mentioned this in the case of Germany. Such fear is entirely groundless. The European Commission\u2019s statistics show that in most countries the number of citizens of the new Member States employed has remained fairly stable before and after enlargement. With the exception of Austria, the figure for workers from the 10\u00a0new Member States employed has not exceeded 1% of the economically active population. In no Member State of the Union has it been the case that the influx of workers from the new Member States has ousted local workers from their jobs. The new arrivals have been taking completely new jobs or previously unfilled positions.\nMr\u00a0President, we need to realise that the US economy will continue to outstrip ours in terms of competitiveness unless we increase the mobility of the labour force in Europe. Unemployment in the EU currently stands at over 8% but even so, there is a shortage of workers in certain areas. Meanwhile, not all Europeans can move freely in search of work. Regrettably, it is very likely that the greater part of the Union\u2019s labour market will remain closed to citizens of the new Member States for a further five years.

On the one hand, the countries of the so-called old Fifteen are bound to ensure that long-term residents receive the same treatment as their own nationals as regards access to the labour market. On the other, many of these same countries are taking advantage of the provisions of the Treaty on Accession and maintaining the ban on free movement of workers where the new Ten are concerned. This state of affairs is contrary to the provisions of the aforementioned Treaty on Accession, pursuant to which European Union citizens have priority over third country nationals regarding access to the labour market. The problem could have been resolved by doing away with the transitional periods for the employment of citizens of the new Member States in the labour markets of the old Union. Unfortunately, only three Member States, namely Ireland, Sweden and the United Kingdom opened up their labour markets from 1\u00a0May\u00a02004. Two other Member States, Spain and Portugal, have stated that they will do so from 1\u00a0May of this year. Sadly, in most of the other Member States fear of the anticipated influx of cheap foreign labour and consequent loss of jobs has won the day. Mrs\u00a0Schroedter mentioned this in the case of Germany. Such fear is entirely groundless. The European Commission\u2019s statistics show that in most countries the number of citizens of the new Member States employed has remained fairly stable before and after enlargement. With the exception of Austria, the figure for workers from the 10\u00a0new Member States employed has not exceeded 1% of the economically active population. In no Member State of the Union has it been the case that the influx of workers from the new Member States has ousted local workers from their jobs. The new arrivals have been taking completely new jobs or previously unfilled positions.\nMr\u00a0President, we need to realise that the US economy will continue to outstrip ours in terms of competitiveness unless we increase the mobility of the labour force in Europe. Unemployment in the EU currently stands at over 8% but even so, there is a shortage of workers in certain areas. Meanwhile, not all Europeans can move freely in search of work. Regrettably, it is very likely that the greater part of the Union\u2019s labour market will remain closed to citizens of the new Member States for a further five years. That is why it is essential for the European Commission to take action to eliminate the contradictions in Union legislation and to extend the free movement of workers."}, {"speaker": "Jacek Protasiewicz (PPE-DE). \u2013", "english": "Jacek Protasiewicz (PPE-DE). \u2013 (PL) Mr\u00a0President, I recall how almost two years ago now, a few days after the historic enlargement of the European Union, I took the floor in this House and called on the governments of the so-called old Union to be brave and to abandon transitional periods. I called on them to open up their labour markets to citizens of the new Member States. Unfortunately, only three Member States were courageous enough to open up their labour markets at that time.

I would like to thank Commissioner Vladimir Spidla, who has prepared an excellent summarising report, presenting an accurate and authentic picture of the labour market processes in the past period.\nThe aim of Hungary and of the other new Member States is to see that all legal and administrative obstacles currently hindering the free movement of workers in the European Union are lifted. We would like to be equal citizens of the European Union. Opening up the labour market and ensuring the free movement of workers is not a gift or a favour, but the reasonable decision of the nine old Member States, which would have beneficial effects on all the citizens of the European Union.\nIt is the competitiveness of the European Union that is at stake. I hope that nine old Member States will realise this, and that in April 2006, at the end of the two-year transitional period, the remaining nine Member States will also make a favourable decision, joining Finland, Spain and Portugal, who are opening up their market now.\nWe must thank the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland and Sweden, who were the first to open their market. This step has brought a significant advantage to these countries. In the Republic of Ireland, the rate of unemployment has fallen in the past two years, partly due to the positive effects created by workers from new Member States. In the United Kingdom, the influx of workers contributed to economic growth and an improvement in competitiveness. Consequently, the accusations and fears related to mass immigration and social dumping are simply unfounded.\nMany thanks to Finland, Spain and Portugal, who have announced that they, too, are opening their labour market.\nIt is highly hypocritical that the nine old Member States who are not lifting their restrictions are allowing the entry of workforce from non-European Union countries, but refuse to allow entry to workers from the new Member States. At this late hour I need to argue with Commissioner Frattini. What he has said is only true in the countries that have opened their labour market. In those countries it is, indeed, possible to give priority to workers from new Member States over workers from third countries. In countries that have not opened their labour market, this issue does not even arise.

I would like to thank Commissioner Vladimir Spidla, who has prepared an excellent summarising report, presenting an accurate and authentic picture of the labour market processes in the past period.\nThe aim of Hungary and of the other new Member States is to see that all legal and administrative obstacles currently hindering the free movement of workers in the European Union are lifted. We would like to be equal citizens of the European Union. Opening up the labour market and ensuring the free movement of workers is not a gift or a favour, but the reasonable decision of the nine old Member States, which would have beneficial effects on all the citizens of the European Union.\nIt is the competitiveness of the European Union that is at stake. I hope that nine old Member States will realise this, and that in April 2006, at the end of the two-year transitional period, the remaining nine Member States will also make a favourable decision, joining Finland, Spain and Portugal, who are opening up their market now.\nWe must thank the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland and Sweden, who were the first to open their market. This step has brought a significant advantage to these countries. In the Republic of Ireland, the rate of unemployment has fallen in the past two years, partly due to the positive effects created by workers from new Member States. In the United Kingdom, the influx of workers contributed to economic growth and an improvement in competitiveness. Consequently, the accusations and fears related to mass immigration and social dumping are simply unfounded.\nMany thanks to Finland, Spain and Portugal, who have announced that they, too, are opening their labour market.\nIt is highly hypocritical that the nine old Member States who are not lifting their restrictions are allowing the entry of workforce from non-European Union countries, but refuse to allow entry to workers from the new Member States. At this late hour I need to argue with Commissioner Frattini. What he has said is only true in the countries that have opened their labour market. In those countries it is, indeed, possible to give priority to workers from new Member States over workers from third countries. In countries that have not opened their labour market, this issue does not even arise. Therefore, opening the labour markets is a matter of principle, of competitiveness and of eliminating discrimination, as well as a matter of equality between the fifteen old and the ten new Member States."}, {"speaker": "\u0160ar\u016bnas Birutis (ALDE).", "english": "\u0160ar\u016bnas Birutis (ALDE). \u2013 (LT) What more can I add to the comments made by all those colleagues who spoke before me?

We live in a Community.\nIt is vitally important that we should make it abundantly clear that the four freedoms are among the fundamental rights of the European Union, one of whose principles is the ban on discrimination. The four freedoms are at the heart of the internal market; their implementation makes it a domestic one. These EU principles \u2013 the political goals \u2013 are clear, and they unite us. We must implement them as soon as possible; the reason why we have not yet done so is that our policies are subject to different framework conditions, to different social legislation, different wages, different tax legislation, different labour laws. With 19 million unemployed, we have differing growth rates, which are \u2013 thank heavens \u2013 higher in the new Member States than in the old ones. The result of this is fear and worry on the part of the public. Not least in my own country, which has the longest external border with the new Member States, there are more and more citizens of the new Member States in the workforce.\nWhat we have to do, though, is look into the Treaties and Community law for ways in which we can take public concerns and fears into consideration. Rather than standing in the way, we are seeking acceptable transitions, but transitions are not our goal; what we are aiming to do is to make the four freedoms a reality, to lay fears to rest and join together in seeking joint solutions. Rather than apportioning blame, we need to meet each other halfway."}, {"speaker": "Harald Ettl (PSE).", "english": "Harald Ettl (PSE). \u2013 (DE) Mr President, even if mutual understanding is sometimes made rather difficult by our linguistic differences, it does make sense that it should be the competent committees of this House that work through the Commission\u2019s reports, assessing and debating them. This matter is meant to be handled by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, but this debate, and the question on this point, are pre-empting its deliberations, and that I really do think is something we can do without; there may be reasons for it, but it is, I think, something we can do without.\nLet me start by saying that the Commission communication, which is meant to help do away with the transitional period for the free movement of workers, is, I think, still defective in terms of its substance and \u2013 in the form in which it is presented to us \u2013 not yet watertight in economic terms. Nor are the authors of today\u2019s question looking at the facts from the right angle when they talk in terms of the citizens of the ten new Member States being put at a disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis the nationals of third countries. The fact is that, in Germany, people from the ten new Member States are 3% more likely to be in work than those from third states. In Austria, the difference stands as high as 6%. The advantage enjoyed by the ten new States is even more pronounced in Great Britain and Ireland. More to the point, data relating to only one year since accession cannot serve as a credible basis for a prognosis of medium and long-term changes in the labour market of the kind that the Commission is putting forward.\nWhen one considers the period to which the evaluation refers, the conclusion at which the communication arrives, namely that the opening-up of the labour market has a positive effect on economic growth and employment, is quite simply wrong. In 2005, there was markedly less economic growth in the EU of 25 than in 2004. This was particularly the case in the United Kingdom, where there was a 1.4% decline and where immigration was ten times greater than the British Government had predicted. In contrast to preceding years, there was also scarcely any reduction in unemployment, and so I call on the Commission to commission, as soon as possible, a study examining worker migration and all the effects associated with it, and doing so in a value-free way.\nThat will be beneficial not only to the Commission, but also in terms of continued rational dialogue. I would add that, while I too would like to see an early reduction in the transitional periods, that will require good accompanying measures in a suitable framework, and the revision of the Posting of Workers Directive.

Wenn das Aufeinanderzugehen manchmal nicht sprachlich schon so schwierig w\u00e4re \u2013 es hat schon seinen Sinn im Europ\u00e4ischen Parlament, dass wir Kommissionsberichte in den zust\u00e4ndigen Aussch\u00fcssen bearbeiten, dar\u00fcber befinden und dar\u00fcber diskutieren. In diesem Fall, wo der Besch\u00e4ftigungsausschuss daf\u00fcr zust\u00e4ndig ist, haben wir heute eine vorgezogene Diskussion und eine vorgezogene Anfrage zu diesem Punkt. Das halte ich im wahrsten Sinne des Wortes f\u00fcr entbehrlich. Es mag Gr\u00fcnde daf\u00fcr geben, aber ich halte es f\u00fcr entbehrlich.\nVorweg. Die Mitteilung der Kommission, die helfen soll, die \u00dcbergangsfrist f\u00fcr den freien Arbeitnehmerverkehr rasch zu beseitigen, halte ich f\u00fcr inhaltlich noch mangelhaft und \u00f6konomisch \u2013 wie pr\u00e4sentiert \u2013 noch nicht f\u00fcr schl\u00fcssig. Die heutigen Anfragesteller, die von einer Benachteiligung der B\u00fcrger der 10 neuen Mitgliedstaaten (EU-10) gegen\u00fcber Angeh\u00f6rigen aus Drittstaaten sprechen, haben sich die Faktenlage ebenfalls nicht richtig angesehen. Faktum ist, dass in Deutschland Personen aus der EU-10 eine um 3\u00a0% h\u00f6here Besch\u00e4ftigungsquote aufweisen als Drittstaatangeh\u00f6rige. In \u00d6sterreich liegt diese Differenz sogar bei 6\u00a0%. Noch extremer verh\u00e4lt es sich in Gro\u00dfbritannien und in Irland zu Gunsten der EU-10. Dar\u00fcber hinaus kann mit Daten von nur einem Jahr seit dem Beitritt noch keine mittel- und langfristige Entwicklung am Arbeitsmarkt, wie von der Kommission dargestellt, seri\u00f6s prognostiziert werden.\nDie Schlussfolgerung in der Mitteilung, dass die \u00d6ffnung des Arbeitsmarktes positiv auf Wirtschaftswachstum und Besch\u00e4ftigung wirkt, ist bezogen auf den Bewertungszeitraum einfach falsch. Das Wirtschaftswachstum in der EU-25 ist im Jahr 2005 gegen\u00fcber 2004 deutlich zur\u00fcckgegangen. Insbesondere in Gro\u00dfbritannien, wo der R\u00fcckgang 1,4\u00a0% betrug und wo es zu einer zehnmal so hohen Zuwanderung gekommen ist, wie von der britischen Regierung prognostiziert. Im Gegensatz zu den vorangegangenen Jahren ist es auch zu beinahe keinem R\u00fcckgang der Arbeitslosigkeit mehr gekommen. Ich fordere daher die Kommission auf, rasch eine Studie in Auftrag zu geben, die die Wanderungsbewegungen der Arbeitnehmer und alle damit verbundenen Auswirkungen wertfrei analysiert.\nDas ist nicht nur gut f\u00fcr die Kommission, das ist gut f\u00fcr einen weiteren sinnvollen Dialog. Im \u00dcbrigen ben\u00f6tigt die rasche Reduktion der \u00dcbergangsfristen \u2013 und das w\u00fcnsche ich mir auch \u2013 ein gutes Begleitkonzept und gute Begleitma\u00dfnahmen wie z.\u00a0B. die Revision der Entsenderichtlinie.

It was feared that the new Member States would start to offer services of a better quality than in the old Member States, and this resulted in the blocking of the implementation of one of Europe\u2019s fundamental rights, which for fifty years had only existed on paper. There was offensive talk of the movement of services constituting \u2018social dumping\u2019, and the mythical plombier polonais was invoked to frighten citizens of the old Member States. This rhetoric humiliated the new Member States and left their citizens with the impression that they were not human beings. The conflict was not, however, between left-wing and right-wing forces, and the old Member States quickly found a compromise among themselves: some defended their large companies, while others protected their trade unions.
