{"speaker": "Toomas Hendrik Ilves (PSE). \u2013", "english": "Toomas Hendrik Ilves (PSE). \u2013 (ET) I would pose a broader question \u2013 why do the new Member States feel that there is an increasing rift between themselves and the old Member States?\nI will begin by mentioning the Services Directive. It was feared that the new Member States would start to offer services of a better quality than in the old Member States, and this resulted in the blocking of the implementation of one of Europe\u2019s fundamental rights, which for fifty years had only existed on paper. There was offensive talk of the movement of services constituting \u2018social dumping\u2019, and the mythical plombier polonais was invoked to frighten citizens of the old Member States. This rhetoric humiliated the new Member States and left their citizens with the impression that they were not human beings. The conflict was not, however, between left-wing and right-wing forces, and the old Member States quickly found a compromise among themselves: some defended their large companies, while others protected their trade unions. But Eastern Europe opened up its market long before it joined the European Union, and as a result large companies from the old Member States have for years simply bought up companies in Eastern Europe without the constraints of a services directive. They came to our market and bought it, but when our turn came, the door was closed. It is the small companies and citizens of the new Member States, as well as consumers in the old Member States, who suffer as a result of this.\nSecondly, the restriction of the free movement of labour makes the new Europeans into second-class citizens. Some citizens of the EU are entitled to move freely, while others are not \u2013 on the basis of their citizenship. Neo-protectionism in the EU limits the civil rights of citizens of the new Member States, often using xenophobic rhetoric, as we noticed in the case of the debating of the Services Directive. Although the labour market is closed, the old Member States have for years gladly picked out those workers they lack \u2013 for instance, doctors, nurses and IT specialists. They would not consider insulting these workers by branding them with the label of dumping, because their recruitment is often even funded by state subsidy.\nThirdly, we have now seen the implementation of a directive stipulating that non-citizens who have lived in an EU Member State for five years are entitled to freedom of movement, but citizens of the new EU Member States lack that right. What can one conclude from this? Citizens of the new Member States are not only second-class, but even third-class citizens.\nMy question is this: what action does Europe plan to take to ensure that this intolerable protectionism and obvious discrimination does not split the newly reunited Europe?", "lang": "ET", "original": "Toomas Hendrik Ilves (PSE). \u2013 Ma k\u00fcsiksin laiemalt \u2013 miks tunnevad uued liikmesriigid, et l\u00f5he nende ja vanade vahel aina s\u00fcveneb?\nAlustaksin teenuste direktiiviga. Kardeti, et uued liikmesriigid hakkavad teenuseid pakkuma paremini ja seet\u00f5ttu takistati Euroopa viisk\u00fcmmend aastat vaid kirjas seisva \u00fche p\u00f5hi\u00f5iguse elluviimist. Solvavalt r\u00e4\u00e4giti teenuste liikumisest kui social dumping 'ust, hirmutati m\u00fc\u00fctilise plombier polonais' ga. Retoorika alandas uusi liikmesriike, nagu me justkui polekski inimesed. Vastasseis aga polnud vasak- ja parempoolsete vahel, vanad liikmed leidsid kompromissi kergelt: \u00fched kaitsesid oma suurfirmasid, teised oma ameti\u00fchinguid. Ida-Euroopa aga avas oma turu ammu enne, kui sai ELi liikmeks ja seet\u00f5ttu on vanade liikmesriikide suurfirmad aastaid ilma teenuste direktiivita lihtsalt \u00e4ra ostnud firmasid Ida-Euroopas. Tuldi meie turule, osteti \u00e4ra, aga kui meie kord saabus, suleti uks meie ees. Kannatasid uute liikmete v\u00e4ikefirmad, kodanikud ning vanade liikmesriikide tarbijad.\nTeiseks, t\u00f6\u00f6j\u00f5u vaba liikumise piiramine teeb uutest eurooplastest teise klassi kodanikud. \u00dchel on \u00f5igus liikuda, teisel pole \u2013 kodakondsusest l\u00e4htuvalt. Uusprotektsionism ELis piirab uute liikmete kodanike\u00f5igusi, kasutades sageli ksenofoobilist retoorikat, mida t\u00e4heldasime teenuste direktiivi debati puhul. Olgugi et t\u00f6\u00f6turg on suletud, v\u00e4rbavad vanad liikmesriigid hea meelega juba aastaid valikuliselt neid t\u00f6\u00f6tajaid, kellest neil puudus on, n\u00e4iteks arste, med\u00f5desid, IT-spetsialiste. Nende puhul ei tule p\u00e4hegi solvata neid dumpingus\u00fc\u00fcdistusega, sest sageli on nende v\u00e4rbamine lausa riiklikult doteeritud.\nKolmandaks, j\u00f5ustus direktiiv, kus viis aastat liikmesriigis elanud Euroopa mittekodanik naudib \u00f5igust vabale liikumisele, mis ELi uute liikmesriikide kodanikel puudub. Mida j\u00e4reldada? Uue liikmesriigi kodanik pole mitte teise, vaid lausa kolmanda j\u00e4rgu kodanik.\nMinu k\u00fcsimus on, mida kavatseb Euroopa ette v\u00f5tta, et selline talumatu protektsionism ja selge diskrimineerimine ei l\u00f5hestaks \u00e4sja taas\u00fchinenud Euroopat?", "agenda_item": "Free movement of workers and transition periods (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060313-ITEM-022", "intervention_id": "1-185", "summary_english": "```json\n{\n  \"headline\": \"MEP Condemns EU Neo-Protectionism Creating Second and Third-Class Citizens from New Member States\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"The speaker raises concerns about growing discrimination against new EU Member States through restrictions on services and labor movement, creating a rift between old and new members.
