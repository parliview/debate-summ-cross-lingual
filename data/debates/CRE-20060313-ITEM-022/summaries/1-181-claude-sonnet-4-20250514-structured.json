{"speaker": "Konrad Szyma\u0144ski (UEN). \u2013", "english": "Konrad Szyma\u0144ski (UEN). \u2013 (PL) Mr\u00a0President, the plain and uncomfortable truth is that the old Member States were more than happy to open up markets where they held the competitive advantage, namely concerning the free flow of capital. I would point out that where the new Member States held the competitive advantage, the markets remain closed. One example is the services market, and the labour market could serve as another.\nFrom 23\u00a0January, following final implementation of the directive concerning residents, the situation regarding access to the labour market by third-country citizens may actually be better than that of citizens of the countries that recently joined the Union. I found your explanations interesting, Commissioner, but they failed to convince me. I think the House should hear more on this subject. All this is in clear contradiction to the provisions of the Treaties on Accession. It is worth emphasising yet again to the House that not one of the countries that opened their labour market has recorded an increase in unemployment or in other social problems such as benefit fraud. On the contrary, the cheaper labour force from the new Member States has reinvigorated the economy. Two years down the line we can state categorically that there is no economic justification for these restrictions.\nPursuant to the Commission\u2019s plans, this year is the European Year of Workers\u2019 Mobility. It should be emphasised that low worker mobility is also related to the closed labour markets in most of the Member States. If Member States insist on maintaining the unjustified closure of the labour markets, 2006 may well turn out to be the year of European hypocrisy rather than the European Year of Workers\u2019 Mobility.", "lang": "PL", "original": "Konrad Szyma\u0144ski (UEN). \u2013 Panie Przewodnicz\u0105cy!
