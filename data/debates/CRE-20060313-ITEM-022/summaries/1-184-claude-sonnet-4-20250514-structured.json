The old Member States must come to a decision on the extension or abolition of the transition period. The United Kingdom, Ireland and Sweden opened their markets immediately and benefited, and at the same time encouraged the new Member States to view their own labour in a somewhat different light and evaluate it better. The job market of EU-15 has not been flooded by labour from the new states. Expansion has encouraged the legalisation of previously illegal jobs. No transition periods will stop a person who wants to leave. A person's freedom of movement is the cornerstone value of the European Community. On 26 January, a Council Directive entered into force allowing the citizens of third countries, who have lived in the EU for five years, to move freely, come to study, work or simply live in any EU country. Why did the Council adopt a Directive which is discriminatory with respect to the new countries? Why is there such huge opposition to restore justice? It is good news that Finland, Spain and Portugal plan to abandon the transition period. Austria and Germany initiated the introduction of the transition periods. The results of the two years have shown that the new states do not pose a threat. I urge Austria and the other remaining states to abandon the discriminatory transition period and this discriminatory view of the new Member States.", "lang": "LT", "original": "Danut\u0117 Budreikait\u0117 (ALDE). \u2013 Paskutiniam pl\u0117tros etapui jau sukanka 2 metai, baigiasi 7 met\u0173 pereinamojo laikotarpio pirmoji dalis.
