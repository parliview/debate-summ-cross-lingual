{"speaker": "Jules Maaten (ALDE). \u2013", "english": "Jules Maaten (ALDE). \u2013 (NL) The VVD Group in the European Parliament is in favour of the \u2018old\u2019 Member States lifting the restrictions on workers from the new ones. All European countries derive economic benefit from opening up their borders. In the Netherlands, for example, we are short of manpower in the metal, horticultural, agricultural and health care industries. The open borders policy in Great Britain, Ireland and Sweden has proved to be a success. If we unlock the front door, at least we will have a say in who we allow in, instead of frantically trying to keep illegal entrants away from the back doors. That has proved impossible, for every year, we notice that seasonal labour, in particular, is carried out by illegal workers.", "lang": "NL", "original": "Jules Maaten (ALDE). \u2013 De VVD-Eurofractie is er voorstander van dat de \u201coude\u201d lidstaten de beperkingen op werknemers uit de nieuwe lidstaten opheffen.

In Groot-Brittanni\u00eb, Ierland en Zweden zijn de open grenzen een succes gebleken. Als we de voordeur van het slot halen hebben we zelf in de hand wie we binnen laten in plaats van dat we krampachtig proberen de illegale achterdeurtjes gesloten te houden. Dat blijkt onmogelijk, want elk jaar zien we weer dat vooral de seizoensgebonden arbeid door illegale werknemers wordt verricht.", "agenda_item": "Free movement of workers and transition periods (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060313-ITEM-022", "intervention_id": "1-188", "summary_english": "```json\n{\n  \"headline\": \"VVD Group Advocates for Lifting Worker Movement Restrictions Between Old and New EU Member States\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"The speaker addresses restrictions on workers moving from new EU Member States to old ones, highlighting labor shortages in specific industries and the problem of illegal workers performing seasonal labor.\",\n  \"positionSum\": \"The VVD Group strongly supports lifting restrictions on workers from new Member States, arguing that all European countries benefit economically from open borders and citing successful examples from Great Britain, Ireland and Sweden.\",\n  \"argSum\": \"The speaker argues that open borders provide economic benefits, help address labor shortages in key industries, allow countries to control legal immigration rather than fighting illegal entry, and that current restrictions lead to reliance on illegal seasonal workers.\",\n  \"propSum\": \"The speaker proposes that 'old' Member States should lift restrictions on workers from new EU Member States, advocating for an open borders policy similar to that implemented by Great Britain, Ireland and Sweden.\",\n  \"quotes\": [\n    \"All European countries derive economic benefit from opening up their borders\",\n    \"If we unlock the front door, at least we will have a say in who we allow in, instead of frantically trying to keep illegal entrants away from the back doors\",\n    \"we notice that seasonal labour, in particular, is carried out by illegal workers\"\n  ]\n}\n```", "summary_original": "```json\n{\n  \"headline\": \"VVD Euro-faction advocates lifting restrictions on workers from new EU member states\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"The speaker addresses restrictions on workers from new EU member states, highlighting labor shortages in sectors like metal, horticulture, agriculture, and healthcare in the Netherlands, and the problem of illegal seasonal workers.\",\n  \"positionSum\": \"The speaker strongly supports lifting restrictions on workers from new member states, arguing that all European countries benefit economically from open borders and that controlled legal migration is preferable to attempting to prevent illegal entry.\",\n  \"argSum\": \"The speaker argues that open borders have proven successful in the UK, Ireland, and Sweden, that legal channels allow better control over who enters compared to futile attempts to prevent illegal entry, and that seasonal work is inevitably performed by illegal workers when legal channels are restricted.\",\n  \"propSum\": \"The speaker proposes that 'old' member states should lift restrictions on workers from new member states to address labor shortages and better manage migration flows.\",\n  \"quotes\": [\n    \"De VVD-Eurofractie is er voorstander van dat de oude lidstaten de beperkingen op werknemers uit de nieuwe lidstaten opheffen\",\n    \"Alle Europese landen hebben er economisch baat bij de grenzen open te stellen\",\n    \"Als we de voordeur van het slot halen hebben we zelf in de hand wie we binnen laten in plaats van dat we krampachtig proberen de illegale achterdeurtjes gesloten te houden\"\n  ]\n}\n```", "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "method": "structured"}
