{"speaker": "Csaba S\u00e1ndor Tabajdi (PSE).", "english": "Csaba S\u00e1ndor Tabajdi (PSE). \u2013 (HU) Mr President, I would like to thank my colleague, Istv\u00e1n Szent-Iv\u00e1nyi, for the inclusion of this topic on the agenda once more; this is not only important to the Member States, but to all of Europe. I would like to thank Commissioner Vladimir Spidla, who has prepared an excellent summarising report, presenting an accurate and authentic picture of the labour market processes in the past period.\nThe aim of Hungary and of the other new Member States is to see that all legal and administrative obstacles currently hindering the free movement of workers in the European Union are lifted. We would like to be equal citizens of the European Union. Opening up the labour market and ensuring the free movement of workers is not a gift or a favour, but the reasonable decision of the nine old Member States, which would have beneficial effects on all the citizens of the European Union.\nIt is the competitiveness of the European Union that is at stake. I hope that nine old Member States will realise this, and that in April 2006, at the end of the two-year transitional period, the remaining nine Member States will also make a favourable decision, joining Finland, Spain and Portugal, who are opening up their market now.\nWe must thank the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland and Sweden, who were the first to open their market. This step has brought a significant advantage to these countries. In the Republic of Ireland, the rate of unemployment has fallen in the past two years, partly due to the positive effects created by workers from new Member States. In the United Kingdom, the influx of workers contributed to economic growth and an improvement in competitiveness. Consequently, the accusations and fears related to mass immigration and social dumping are simply unfounded.\nMany thanks to Finland, Spain and Portugal, who have announced that they, too, are opening their labour market.\nIt is highly hypocritical that the nine old Member States who are not lifting their restrictions are allowing the entry of workforce from non-European Union countries, but refuse to allow entry to workers from the new Member States. At this late hour I need to argue with Commissioner Frattini. What he has said is only true in the countries that have opened their labour market. In those countries it is, indeed, possible to give priority to workers from new Member States over workers from third countries. In countries that have not opened their labour market, this issue does not even arise. Therefore, opening the labour markets is a matter of principle, of competitiveness and of eliminating discrimination, as well as a matter of equality between the fifteen old and the ten new Member States.", "lang": "HU", "original": "Csaba S\u00e1ndor Tabajdi (PSE). \u2013 Tisztelt Eln\u00f6k \u00dar!
