The temporary transitional arrangements that a number of countries \u2013 including my own, Denmark \u2013 have chosen to introduce in relation to Eastern European workers must be cancelled as quickly as is reasonably possible.\nThe transitional arrangements must not unnecessarily hamper freedom of movement, and we must demonstrate solidarity and openness towards all Europeans. The rules must therefore be made flexible so that all unnecessary barriers are removed. However, the transitional rules must only be abolished once we have made sure that people travelling here from Eastern Europe are not being exploited. The transitional rules in Denmark serve as protection against exploitation and ensure that workers receive the wages provided for by collective agreements. Eastern European labour is too often exploited by employers who pay wages significantly below the norm and allow their employees to work under miserable conditions.\nWe have a responsibility to defend workers\u2019 freedom of movement, which is a fundamental right in the EU. However, it is also our responsibility to defend employees\u2019 conditions and to guarantee that everyone receives proper wages and enjoys proper working conditions. The transitional conditions were, and are, an attempt to attend simultaneously to both considerations.\nWe have no minimum wage in Denmark. The transitional rules have therefore made it possible to monitor the influx of workers from Eastern Europe so that efforts could be concentrated on those employers who have tried to circumvent the rules governing wages and working conditions.\nThe time is ripe for slowly phasing out the restrictions.", "lang": "DA", "original": "Ole Christensen (PSE). - Arbejdstagernes fri bev\u00e6gelighed er en af grundpillerne i det europ\u00e6iske samarbejde.
