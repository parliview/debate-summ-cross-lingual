{"speaker": "\u0160ar\u016bnas Birutis (ALDE). \u2013", "english": "\u0160ar\u016bnas Birutis (ALDE). \u2013 (LT) I welcome your comments on the citizens of third countries and this problem in general. I congratulate the rapporteur for preparing a very balanced report. The free movement of labour is not just one of the fundamental rights of the European Union, but is an expression of the solidarity between the old and new countries. Therefore, I am pleased to see that all of my colleagues show unanimous support for the abolition of the restrictions. As we react to the challenges of today's global economy, I believe that the abolition of obstacles to the movement of citizens and labour in the European Union's market is one of the main goals of the Lisbon Strategy and one of the factors stimulating economic growth.\nWith their accumulated human capital, the active workers from the new European Union Member States have the ability to stimulate long-term economic growth. Moreover, the market may become more effective, as foreign workers usually react more actively to the regional differences of economic opportunities. Having admitted workers from the new states, Ireland, the United Kingdom and Sweden only benefited. The aforementioned Member States are noted for rapid economic growth, reduced unemployment and increased employment compared to other states. In addition, it can be concluded that citizens of the new Member States have complemented, but not replaced citizens of the old Member States in the labour markets of the latter. Statistical data from European Union Member States indicates that immigration from third countries exceeds the flow of immigration in the heart of the European Union. We should congratulate and rejoice in the decision of those countries which have decided to open their labour markets to the new European Union countries from May this year. I would say: shame on the governments of Austria, which is holding the EU Presidency, and Germany, for their phobias, for their inability to discuss this matter with their own citizens. But of course, the opening of labour markets is the sovereign right of every state.", "lang": "LT", "original": "\u0160ar\u016bnas Birutis (ALDE). \u2013 Sveikinu j\u016bs\u0173 komentar\u0105 d\u0117l tre\u010di\u0173j\u0173 \u0161ali\u0173 pilie\u010di\u0173 ir \u0161ios problemos apskritai.
