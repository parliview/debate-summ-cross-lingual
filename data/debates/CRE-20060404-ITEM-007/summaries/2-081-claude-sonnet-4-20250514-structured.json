{"speaker": "Csaba S\u00e1ndor Tabajdi (PSE). \u2013", "english": "Csaba S\u00e1ndor Tabajdi (PSE). \u2013 (HU) I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Csaba \u0150ry, for his excellent work, and would like to thank Commissioner \u0160pidla for the summarising report which often provokes a dispute, due to differing interests. Colleagues from certain states are criticising the report, but the majority are finding this objective report very helpful indeed.\nWhen new Member States are fighting for equal rights, this is more than just a simple fight for equal treatment: it protects the interests of the entire European Union. It is a paradox that it is the new Member States who are pressing for the liberalisation of the labour market, which, just like the liberalisation of services, should be implemented by the European Union anyway, in the interest of its own competitiveness. We would like to be citizens with equal rights of the European Union. The opening up of the labour market and the free movement of workers is not a gift or a favour; it is the rational decision of the eight old Member States, which would result in favourable effects for all citizens of the European Union.\nOur thanks go to the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Sweden, Finland, Spain, Portugal and Holland, and we hope that the remaining eight Member States will also consider their position. I agree with Commissioner \u0160pidla: it is inadmissible that third-country nationals with five years of legal residence should be in a more favourable position than workers from the ten new Member States in countries that have not opened their labour markets to them.", "lang": "HU", "original": "Csaba S\u00e1ndor Tabajdi (PSE). \u2013 Gratul\u00e1lok \u0150ry Csaba jelent\u00e9stev\u0151nek a kiv\u00e1l\u00f3 munk\u00e1j\u00e1hoz, \u00e9s szeretn\u00e9k k\u00f6sz\u00f6netet mondani \u0160pidla biztos \u00farnak az\u00e9rt az \u00f6sszefoglal\u00f3 jelent\u00e9s\u00e9rt, amely gyakorta vit\u00e1t v\u00e1lt ki, \u00e9ppen a k\u00fcl\u00f6nb\u00f6z\u0151 \u00e9rdekek alapj\u00e1n.
