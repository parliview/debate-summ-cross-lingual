{"speaker": "Jan Jerzy Ku\u0142akowski,", "english": "Jan Jerzy Ku\u0142akowski, on behalf of the ALDE Group . \u2013 (PL) Mr\u00a0President, I believe that four fundamental criteria should be borne in mind when considering Mr\u00a0\u0150ry\u2019s report on the transitional arrangements restricting the free movement of workers on EU labour markets.\nFirstly, the free movement of persons is one of the four fundamental freedoms of the single market and every European Union citizen\u2019s right. Recognition of that right requires transitional periods to be lifted at the earliest opportunity. This does not imply promoting mass movements across the European Union. A distinction should be made between movements triggered by the need to seek employment and the free movement of persons which is a citizen\u2019s right.\nSecondly, the report rightly points out the benefits gained by countries that did not impose transitional periods and opened up their labour markets immediately. This is in line with the European Commission\u2019s view. It would, however, also be appropriate to consider how the free movement of people can either threaten or benefit the countries of origin of the citizens involved.\nThirdly, it is important that Member State citizens should not be discriminated against in favour of third-country nationals on the European Union\u2019s labour markets. Of course, this does not imply that we are indifferent to the interests of third-country nationals or that we do not wish to express solidarity with them too.\nFinally, the free movement of persons should be deemed a key feature of the European social model. Bearing in mind that Mr\u00a0\u0150ry\u2019s report and the position of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs comply with the aforementioned criteria, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe will vote in favour of the report. We would also like to thank Mr\u00a0\u0150ry for his work.", "lang": "PL", "original": "Jan Jerzy Ku\u0142akowski, w imieniu grupy ALDE . \u2013 Panie Przewodnicz\u0105cy!
