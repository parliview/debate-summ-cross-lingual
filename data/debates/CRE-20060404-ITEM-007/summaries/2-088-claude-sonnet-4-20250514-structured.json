{"speaker": "Stephen Hughes (PSE). \u2013", "english": "Stephen Hughes (PSE). \u2013 Mr President, I congratulate Mr \u0150ry on producing an excellent report. I should like to make three brief points, the first of which concerns paragraph 1. As it came out of committee, it now calls on Member States to abolish the transitional measures in force. For many that has become the main focus of the report. I know that the rapporteur has felt pressured to table a compromise saying that Member States should consider abolishing those measures and specifically mentioning the three Member States that did not introduce them in the first place. Many in my group support the text as it now stands, feeling that we should be against any continuation of transitional measures. However, in saying that, they are reading it alongside paragraph 14, which says that Member States that continue to use such measures should take all steps to ensure that they do not continue beyond 2009.\nMy second point concerns equal treatment. The rapporteur and others here today have made the point forcefully that it is not just a question of making sure that A8 workers have the right to freedom of movement of labour, we have to ensure inspection and enforcement regimes grant them full equal treatment and prevent exploitation in the 15. There have been serious breaches in both the UK and the Republic of Ireland.\nMy final point relates to Directive 2003/109/EC, referred to by the Commissioner. It grants full access to the Member States\u2019 labour markets for long-term resident third-country nationals. Parliament\u2019s Legal Service has said this poses no danger of creating a situation where third-country nationals have greater access than A8 citizens. The Legal Service points out that Article 11 of the Directive says that Member States \u2018may\u2019 restrict equal treatment for third-country nationals in certain cases. Saying that Member States \u2018may\u2019 is not the same as saying they \u2018must\u2019 or that they \u2018will\u2019. The only way to guarantee equal treatment is to end transitional measures.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Stephen Hughes (PSE). \u2013 Mr President, I congratulate Mr \u0150ry on producing an excellent report.
