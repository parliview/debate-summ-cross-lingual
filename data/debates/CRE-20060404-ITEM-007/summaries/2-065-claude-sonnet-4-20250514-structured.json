{"speaker": "Richard Falbr,", "english": "Richard Falbr, on behalf of the PSE Group . \u2013 (CS) Mr President, as has been said, 2006 has been declared the European Year of Workers\u2019 Mobility. On the initiative of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, a draft Parliamentary resolution was drawn up, which the Committee approved on 21 March by an overwhelming majority. For the preparation of the report thanks are due especially to Mr \u0150ry. The central feature of the resolution is the call to scrap the current transitional measures. Immediately after approval the amendment proposals began to come in, aimed at removing this prospective message from Parliament. It is remarkable how every one of the proposals begins with the words \u2018I support the free movement of workers, but \u2026\u2019. I therefore take the view that Parliament should approve the same version that has been approved by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.\nI would like to remind you that both employers\u2019 groups and the European Trade Union Confederation are requesting that the transitional measures be scrapped immediately. I am aware that some governments have not done so, and those that have done deserve our thanks. In response to the complaints we have heard today in speeches on the poor state of the European Union, I would like to say that neither the American nor the Chinese way should be models for us and that following the major crisis in Asia some years ago many states over there are thinking of developing the sort of structures that some persons here today are seeking to demolish. It would therefore be a very good thing for us to realise that the path to prosperity leads neither through Chinese-style wage levels nor through the sort of industrial relations that prevail in the United States.", "lang": "CS", "original": "Richard Falbr, za skupinu PSE . \u2013 Pane p\u0159edsedaj\u00edc\u00ed, jak bylo \u0159e\u010deno, rok 2006 byl vyhl\u00e1\u0161en Evropsk\u00fdm rokem mobility pracovn\u00edch sil.
