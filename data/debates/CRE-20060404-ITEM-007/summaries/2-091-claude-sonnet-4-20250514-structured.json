However, we also know that this freedom is only valid and fully established only for citizens of the fifteen old Member States, while citizens of the eight new Member States, which became members on 1 May 2004, are subject to the provisions of the transition period and this transition period may last as long as seven years in accordance with the 2+3+2 year formula. As if this were not enough, according to certain EU directives, in some cases, long-term residents from third countries enjoy rights, which give them a more privileged status than citizens of the eight new Member States, to live and enter the labour market in fifteen EU Member States. And this means that by demonstrating solidarity with workers from third countries, we are discriminating against workers from the new EU Member States.\nAs the first transition period ends on 30 April, we have a perfect opportunity to evaluate its consequences and effects on the economies of both the fifteen old Member States and the eight new Member States and to make appropriate decisions. True, we lack statistical data on immigration in the heart of the Community. It is difficult to come to objective conclusions, but today, it is already obvious that immigration from third countries greatly exceeds the flow of immigration at the heart of the EU, that is in the fifteen old Member States and the whole of the enlarged EU. It is also obvious that the countries which opened their labour markets to citizens of the new countries have really only benefited, while the transition periods encourage illegal work, unfair working conditions, discrimination against and exploitation of migrant workers. I am convinced that the European Parliament must encourage Member States to abolish the provisions of the transition period currently in force, as there are more than enough reasons to do this.", "lang": "LT", "original": "Laima Liucija Andrikien\u0117 (PPE-DE). \u2013 Mes visi puikiai \u017einome, kad laisvas darbuotoj\u0173 jud\u0117jimas yra viena i\u0161 keturi\u0173 pagrindini\u0173 laisvi\u0173, kuriomis remiasi visa Europos Bendrij\u0173 id\u0117ja.
