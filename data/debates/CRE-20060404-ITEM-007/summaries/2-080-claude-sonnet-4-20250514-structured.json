{"speaker": "Edit Bauer (PPE-DE).", "english": "Edit Bauer (PPE-DE). \u2013 (SK) The free movement of persons and access to labour markets has undoubtedly become a sensitive political issue. The rapporteur, Mr\u00a0\u0150ry, has handled this topic skilfully, without causing division among the Member States. In his report, he focuses on the real effects of citizens from the new Member States entering the labour markets of the fifteen old Member States. He supports the premise that it is not the Member States and their interactions that pose the real problem to European competitiveness, but rather external competitors such as India and China.\nThe report considers the following facts: firstly, workers from the new Member States nowhere exceed 2% of the host country population; secondly, internal migration within the old Member States is four times greater than internal migration from the new Member States and, thirdly, migration from third countries significantly exceeds total internal migration within the EU. There is no doubt that, in addition to the German, Austrian and French attitudes to the transitional period, divergent opinions also exist among the new Member States, as the transitional period has gradually become a\u00a0sensitive political issue there as well.\nWe adopted the transitional measures during the accession talks, as part of the deal. As time goes by, however, this has become a\u00a0sensitive issue in the politics of the old Member States, which are increasingly perceived as discriminatory. Discussions over the Services Directive have already revealed absurd situations in connection with transitional periods and now, with regard to Directive 109, it also appears that a\u00a0legal conflict has arisen with the preferential rules clause. The fears generated by job insecurity and prejudice undoubtedly represent political capital that can be readily used. Instead of propagating this myth, however, which in fact leads to a political impasse, it should be the responsibility of politicians to tell the truth.", "lang": "SK", "original": "Edit Bauer (PPE-DE). \u2013 Vo\u013en\u00fd pohyb os\u00f4b a pr\u00edstup na pracovn\u00e9 trhy sa nepochybne stal senzit\u00edvnou politickou ot\u00e1zkou.
