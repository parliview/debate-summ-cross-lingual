{"speaker": "Roberts Z\u012ble,", "english": "Roberts Z\u012ble, on behalf of the UEN Group . \u2013 (LV) Mr\u00a0President, very recently we experienced a bitter disappointment with the free market in services, but now we see that only a few of the governments of the older Member States are prepared to open their markets to workers from the new Member States. The majority of governments, in continuing to restrict the number of workers from the new Member States, are in fact struggling with more serious problems concerning immigration from non-EU countries.\nThe partial opening of the labour market, for example, to construction workers, doormen and waiters, as France has proposed, does not testify to a readiness for the European fundamental freedoms. It is, instead, testimony to the low prestige of these professions, since unemployment among French youth is very high. This selective opening of the professional market, however, to a labour force with low qualifications means that this will be an incentive for many qualified workers to leave the new Member States, to change profession and immediately earn a higher salary. In the long term, however, this will weaken Europe\u2019s competitiveness.\nFinally, I call on those young French people who are protesting, disappointed in their government because of its discriminatory legislation against them, to come to the new Member States and to launch careers there. We have very low unemployment among young people, and we do not discriminate against them.", "lang": "LV", "original": "Roberts Z\u012ble, UEN grupas v\u0101rd\u0101 . \u2013 Prezidenta kungs!
