Many of us here do not find them convincing. We believe that what we are seeing is \u2013 as has already been mentioned \u2013 evidence of irregular employment and false claims about self-employment. I am willing to bet that in all our countries we have a number of Member States\u2019 citizens in unclear situations.\nWhen the UK introduced its worker registration scheme for nationals of the A8 countries, it found that 40% of the Polish people who registered were already in the UK. I believe that is evidence that people want to work legally. We need to encourage them to do that. We need better information in advance, more effort on inspection and supporting whistle-blowers, and greater clarity about people\u2019s rights, so we do not see the exploitation that Mr\u00a0Cottigny has referred to, which threatens to undercut working conditions and exploits individuals.
