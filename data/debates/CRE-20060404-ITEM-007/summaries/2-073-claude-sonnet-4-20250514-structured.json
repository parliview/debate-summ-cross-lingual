{"speaker": "Jean Louis Cottigny (PSE). \u2013", "english": "Jean Louis Cottigny (PSE). \u2013 (FR) Mr\u00a0President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report by Mr\u00a0\u0150ry, whom I would like at this point to congratulate on his work, could turn out to be a real boon for European workers. The restrictions on the free movement of workers have some harmful effects, including the expansion of illegal work. Just in the last few months, Polish workers have been discovered in France, living in hovels, malnourished, unpaid and with no care \u2013 they had been brought to the country by a German sub-contracting company. Ironically, these workers were involved in building a law court. Where is the justice in that? Such cases are quite unacceptable.\nThe free movement of workers must form one of the factors for promoting social progress, one of the tools for creating a barrier to social dumping. The end of the transitional arrangements will force employers to provide their employees with decent living conditions in accordance with social legislation in the host country. Social protection, decent housing, a decent salary, fair working hours \u2013 those are the basic rights that this freedom of movement should provide, and we will ensure that it does so. We cannot accept a situation where some employers exploit the different nationalities of their employees to reduce their operating costs, in the same way as others play the stock market. Let us remember that the founding European project aims to unite populations, not to divide them. If we continue to restrict the free movement of workers, we will only feed the fears of citizens in certain Member States, who are terrified at the idea of being treated as second-class European citizens. And you are right, Commissioner, we now need to talk in terms of European citizens. These restrictions must be fully lifted. It can be done, but the checks need to be strengthened so that the first beneficiaries of this measure do not become its first victims.", "lang": "FR", "original": "Jean Louis Cottigny (PSE). - Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, Monsieur le Commissaire, chers coll\u00e8gues, le rapport de notre coll\u00e8gue M. \u0150ry, que je f\u00e9licite ici pour son travail, peut se r\u00e9v\u00e9ler un atout pour le travailleur europ\u00e9en. Les mesures de restriction \u00e0 la libre circulation des travailleurs entra\u00eenent des effets n\u00e9fastes, parmi lesquels l\u2019expansion du travail clandestin. Pas plus tard que ces derniers mois, on a d\u00e9couvert en France des ouvriers polonais h\u00e9berg\u00e9s dans des taudis, mal nourris, sans soins, sans salaire, et qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 amen\u00e9s par une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 allemande de sous-traitance. Comble de l\u2019ironie, ces ouvriers travaillaient \u00e0 la construction d\u2019un palais de justice. O\u00f9 en est la justice? De tels faits sont inadmissibles.\nLa libre circulation des travailleurs doit constituer l\u2019un des leviers vers le progr\u00e8s social, l\u2019un des outils visant \u00e0 faire barrage au dumping social. La fin des r\u00e9gimes transitoires obligera les employeurs \u00e0 offrir aux salari\u00e9s des conditions de vie d\u00e9centes dans le respect du droit social du pays d\u2019accueil. Une protection sociale, un logement d\u00e9cent, un salaire d\u00e9cent, des horaires de travail respect\u00e9s, voil\u00e0 quelles sont les bases que doit apporter cette libre circulation, et nous y veillerons. On ne peut accepter que certains puissent jouer sur les diff\u00e9rentes nationalit\u00e9s des salari\u00e9s pour faire baisser le co\u00fbt du travail, comme d\u2019autres jouent \u00e0 la bourse. Rappelons-nous que le projet fondateur europ\u00e9en vise \u00e0 unir les peuples et non \u00e0 les diviser. Continuer de restreindre la libre circulation des travailleurs ne peut que nourrir les craintes de citoyens de certains pays membres, terroris\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019id\u00e9e d\u2019\u00eatre trait\u00e9s en Europ\u00e9ens de seconde zone. Et vous avez raison, Monsieur le Commissaire, il nous faut d\u00e9sormais parler de citoyens europ\u00e9ens. Ces restrictions doivent \u00eatre lev\u00e9es partout. Et cela est possible, mais les contr\u00f4les devront \u00eatre renforc\u00e9s pour que les premiers b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires de cette mesure n\u2019en deviennent pas les premi\u00e8res victimes.", "agenda_item": "Transitional arrangements restricting the free movement of workers on EU labour markets (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060404-ITEM-007", "intervention_id": "2-073", "summary_english": "{\n\"headline\": \"EU Worker Movement Restrictions Must End to Combat Exploitation and Social Dumping\",\n\"issueSum\": \"The speaker addresses harmful effects of restrictions on free movement of workers, including expansion of illegal work and exploitation cases such as Polish workers living in poor conditions while working for German subcontractors in France.
