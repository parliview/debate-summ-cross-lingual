On that day, I stood, together with Dr\u00a0Otto\u00a0von\u00a0Habsburg, on the border between Slovenia and Austria and took part in a solemn ceremony. What was being celebrated was the fact that, as Slovenia became a member of the EU, a town that had undergone a post-war division into two parts \u2013 one of which came to belong to Austria and the other to Slovenia \u2013 was now being reunited.\nThe symbolism was clear and, standing there, I felt strongly that people did not feel that they were entering something new but felt that they were being reunited with something of which they had always been a part. That, moreover, is the way things are. The EU\u2019s ten new Member States are ten old countries of Europe. It is just that Communism had kidnapped them for 50 years, and now they are finally reunited with us.\nIn the run-up to this reunification, Sweden\u2019s Social Democrats had painted horrific pictures of how our country would be invaded by foreign workers who would dump our wages and exploit our social benefits. I and my party fought in the Swedish Parliament to prevent our country from introducing transitional rules. We wanted the new countries, which had for so long suffered under Communism, now to enjoy the freedoms brought about by EU membership.\nWe refused to accept the Social Democrats\u2019 propaganda and demonstrated the nature of real solidarity. We won the battle, and Sweden never introduced any transitional rules. Evaluations carried out now show unambiguously that Sweden has not in the least been exposed to the social dumping invoked by the Social Democrats as a scare tactic. Instead, freedom of movement has only had positive effects on the Swedish economy. The other countries that did not introduce transitional rules have also had the same experience.\nI have to say, moreover, that it was with great disappointment that I learned of several countries\u2019 decision to extend their transitional rules. To do so when the scenarios invoked did not materialise is unreasonable. The only correct thing to do is to refrain from introducing transitional rules, and I hope that, in future, Europe will be influenced more by reason than by fear.\n(Applause)", "lang": "SV", "original": "Anna Ibrisagic (PPE-DE). \u2013 Herr talman! Den 1 maj 2004 \u00e4r en dag som jag alltid kommer att minnas. Den dagen stod jag, tillsammans med doktor Otto von Habsburg, p\u00e5 gr\u00e4nsen mellan Slovenien och \u00d6sterrike och deltog i en h\u00f6gtidlig ceremoni. Man firade att en stad som efter en efterkrigsdelning delades i tv\u00e5 delar, varav en kom att tillh\u00f6ra \u00d6sterrike och en Slovenien, nu \u00e5terf\u00f6renades i och med att Slovenien blev medlem i EU.\nSymboliken var tydlig. Och st\u00e5ende d\u00e4r k\u00e4nde jag starkt att m\u00e4nniskorna inte upplevde att de kom in i n\u00e5got nytt, utan att de \u00e5terf\u00f6renades till n\u00e5got de alltid har varit en del av. Och s\u00e5 \u00e4r det. EU:s tio nya medlemmar \u00e4r Europas tio gamla l\u00e4nder. Det \u00e4r bara det att kommunismen hade kidnappat dem i 50 \u00e5r och nu \u00e4r de \u00e4ntligen \u00e5terf\u00f6renade med oss.\nI Sverige hade socialdemokraterna inf\u00f6r denna \u00e5terf\u00f6rening m\u00e5lat upp skr\u00e4ckscenarier om hur v\u00e5rt land skulle bli invaderat av utl\u00e4ndska arbetstagare som skulle dumpa v\u00e5ra l\u00f6ner och utnyttja v\u00e5ra socialf\u00f6rm\u00e5ner. Jag och mitt parti k\u00e4mpade i Sveriges parlament f\u00f6r att f\u00f6rhindra att v\u00e5rt land skulle inf\u00f6ra \u00f6verg\u00e5ngsregler. Vi ville att de nya l\u00e4nderna, som s\u00e5 l\u00e4nge lidit under kommunismen, nu skulle f\u00e5 ta del av de friheter som EU-medlemskapet inneb\u00e4r.\nVi v\u00e4grade att acceptera socialdemokraternas propaganda och vi visade vad riktig solidaritet \u00e4r. Vi vann striden; Sverige inf\u00f6rde aldrig n\u00e5gra \u00f6verg\u00e5ngsregler. Utv\u00e4rderingarna som gjorts nu visar entydigt att Sverige inte alls har blivit utsatt f\u00f6r den sociala dumping som socialdemokraterna skr\u00e4mdes med, utan att den fria r\u00f6rligheten bara har haft positiva effekter f\u00f6r Sveriges ekonomi. Samma erfarenheter har \u00e4ven de andra l\u00e4nder som l\u00e4t bli att inf\u00f6ra \u00f6verg\u00e5ngsregler.\nOch jag m\u00e5ste s\u00e4ga att det \u00e4r med stor besvikelse som jag har tagit del av flera l\u00e4nders beslut att f\u00f6rl\u00e4nga sina \u00f6verg\u00e5ngsregler. Att g\u00f6ra det n\u00e4r de exempel som man \u00e5beropade uteblev \u00e4r inte f\u00f6rnuftigt. Det enda r\u00e4tta \u00e4r att avst\u00e5 fr\u00e5n \u00f6verg\u00e5ngsregler, och jag hoppas att Europa i framtiden kommer att p\u00e5verkas mer av f\u00f6rnuftet \u00e4n av r\u00e4dslan.\n(Appl\u00e5der)", "agenda_item": "Transitional arrangements restricting the free movement of workers on EU labour markets (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060404-ITEM-007", "intervention_id": "2-090", "summary_english": "```json\n{\n  \"headline\": \"Swedish MEP Opposes Transitional Labour Restrictions, Argues They Are Unnecessary and Counterproductive\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"The speaker addresses transitional arrangements restricting free movement of workers from new EU member states, specifically discussing Sweden's experience and other countries' decisions to extend these restrictions.
