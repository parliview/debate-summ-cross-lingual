The fact that some 30\u00a0speakers from many different parties want to contribute to this debate is confirmation of that.\nMany people have already referred to the basic four freedoms of the EU. Amongst those freedoms, the freedom of movement of people is perhaps the most important. Half a century ago Jean Monnet said of one of the key missions of the EU: \u2018Nous ne coalisons pas les \u00c9tats, nous unissons les hommes\u2019 . That was absolutely right then, it is absolutely right now. That is what we should be doing: uniting the people.\nMention has been made of the fears of some Member States. I do not think we should criticise Member States for having those fears: it is understandable. However, alongside those fears are facts and the facts should put the fears into context. The fact is that such immigrants who have come from central and eastern Europe into the UK, Sweden and Ireland have not been a drain on the economy, but a benefit to it. The problem has not been the legal immigration into our countries, but the illegal immigration to other countries that has propelled the growth of the black economy. The people who are afraid of the problem should be mindful of the fact that this is a much bigger problem than opening up borders at this stage.\nI am glad that there are already three further countries \u2013 Spain, Portugal and Finland \u2013 which have said that they will be removing the barriers. I should like to ask the Commissioner to use his great personal authority as well as that of the Commission to encourage Finland to maintain this issue as a very high point on its agenda in its forthcoming Presidency and to report back at the end of its Presidency on the progress it has made so that it can inspire others to follow its example.\nMeanwhile, I hope that we will all inspire others with a strong vote later this week. I hope we can say to new Member States \u2018there are no second-class citizens in Europe\u2019 and to old Member States \u2018it is time to open your borders and open your minds\u2019.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Philip Bushill-Matthews (PPE-DE). \u2013 Mr President, of the many subjects we will be voting on this week I believe that this report and this subject are the most important.
