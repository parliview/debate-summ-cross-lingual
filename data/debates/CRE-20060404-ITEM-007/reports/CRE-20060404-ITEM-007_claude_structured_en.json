(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, thank you, but I am accustomed to report presentations where the rapporteur speaks first and only then does the Commissioner provide a response. If you have decided to change this practice, however, then I am of course ready to begin.\nI would like to begin, ladies and gentlemen, by thanking Mr \u0150ry for an excellent report on a topic that constitutes one of the pillars of European integration. The aim of the transitional measures set out in the Accession Treaty is to enable Member States to work gradually towards achieving, as quickly as possible, the one irrevocable aim of providing all migrant workers from Member States that joined the European Union in 2004 with open access to employment in all Member States. This is one of the basic freedoms enshrined in the Treaty of Rome. As stated in the Accession Treaty, the Commission has assessed the operation of these transitional measures in respect of the initial two-year stage, in order to assist Member States in deciding either to retain the transitional measures or to abandon them. On the basis of the statistical data for 2004 and in some cases also for 2005, and also following consultations with the individual participants, the Commission has produced some specific conclusions relating to the first stage of the transitional period.\nThe number of workers registered since accession is generally very low, seldom reaching 1% of the active population of the host country. In addition, it seems that the influx of workers from the new Member States has had a basically positive effect. This is because enlargement has contributed to bringing black economy workers from EU-8 states out of the area of illegality. Accession has also led to a reduction in labour shortages and to improved economic results in Europe. The countries that did not introduce restrictions after May 2004 have recorded stronger economic growth, lower levels of unemployment and higher levels of employment. The workers who have been granted legal access to a labour market have experienced little difficulty in joining the market. It is, of course, only the Member States that can decide whether or not to apply the transitional measures, but the Commission may challenge the Member States to evaluate objectively the advantages and disadvantages of the measures. In reality, it is the second stage that is the actual transitional stage, which will bring us, wholly or at least in part, to the objective of freedom of movement for workers. In this spirit, the Member States implementing restrictions on the basis of the Accession Treaty must not treat nationals from EU-8 states who are already legally residing on their territory in a more restrictive way than nationals from third countries who are long-term residents, as reported in the previous plenary session. A letter explaining this has been sent to interior ministers in order to clarify the legal situation. Some moments ago the rapporteur mentioned this problem of citizens of third countries, so I hope you will allow me to emphasise once again that in the context of the directives and treaties on accession, it is not permissible to treat citizens of third countries who are long-term residents of an EU Member State in a more favourable way than citizens of EU Member States, that is, if there are restrictions applying to EU citizens, these shall logically apply also to citizens of third countries who are long-term residents of the EU Member State.\nFor the same reasons the Commission is also monitoring adherence to the provisions that forbid Member States from restricting access to their labour markets for workers from EU-8 states to a greater extent than was the case prior to the signing of the Accession Treaty, that is, prior to 16 April 2003. The Commission is at the same time backing calls for the Member States to apply the Community\u2019s legal regulations scrupulously, especially in the area of posted workers. I acknowledge that we must greatly strengthen statistical monitoring of movements of workers within an EU framework, since there are many hypotheses meriting discussion that are impossible to verify using the existing statistical and analytical resources. The Commission supports proposals from Parliament for reinforcing social dialogue on both a European and a national level, with the aim of upholding the rights of workers from the new Member States. The Commission takes an equally favourable view of raising public awareness of freedom of movement for workers and the associated legislation. The declaration of 2006 as European Year of Workers\u2019 Mobility should contribute to this aim.\nDespite the fears expressed over gradual enlargement, freedom of movement for workers has not undermined intrastate labour markets. The free movement of persons is a basic principle applying to all citizens, and any limitation on it whatsoever can only be temporary and must be expressed strictly within the spirit of the treaties.\nLadies and gentlemen, in my speech I have once or twice used the term \u2018new Member States\u2019 . It must be said that the new states of Central Europe have a history almost as long as the states of other parts of Europe, and with the enlargement of the European Union they are now Member States.

The position of the European institutions carries a political message, and it is primarily meant to clarify, for the over 450 million citizens of the European Union, the pan-European interest in the extremely important issue of the movement of workers. In other words: what is the interest of the European Union as an important player in world politics and world economy? This logic of keeping European interests in mind was decisive in the course of the preparation of the report. The only possible starting point for the evaluation of the current situation was the analysis of the global challenges faced by the European Union at the beginning of the 21st century.\nIn this respect it is sufficient to refer to the fact that our economic competitors in South-East Asia are speeding up both in the area of industrial production and in that of research, development and innovation. If we want to increase our competitiveness to keep up with both America and Asia, we must find a solution to the structural tensions in European economies.\nThe solution is unequivocal: we must increase mobility within the European Union, and we must encourage, with all available means, the creation of a single European labour market, which should be as flexible as possible. There are, of course, alternative solutions to increasing mobility (we can also talk about speeding up immigration and other similar measures), but the common denominator of such alternatives is that their social cost is immeasurably higher, while their efficiency is much lower. The road to economic development \u2013 in line with the Lisbon Strategy \u2013 leads primarily through the increase of mobility and the utilisation of the occupational reserves represented by the inactive population. This is the only way of preserving the social achievements that are so dear to European citizens, and of which we talk so often.\nAn important step within the process of increasing mobility is to lift the transitional restrictions affecting new Member States, as soon as possible. Several Member States already agreed to do this in May 2006, and we can only hope that in the course of the following years \u2013 perhaps even before May 2009 \u2013 other Member States will follow them, because it is important to emphasise that the legal possibility for the other Member States to make a similar decision is always available.\nThe fears concerning mass migration have proved to be groundless. Experiences have unequivocally shown that the presence of workers from new Member States in the old Member States who decided to open their markets fully in 2004 has not caused labour market or economic tensions. On the contrary! The assessment of both the European Commission and one of the affected governments \u2013 the British Government \u2013 has proved that the migration of a restricted extent from new Member States has brought economic advantages to the recipient countries. Therefore, the conclusion is clear: the most advantageous course of action for the European Union and its Member States is for the affected governments to lift the system of transitional measures restricting free employment within the Union, as soon as possible.\nWe also submitted proposals for compromises with the report. These were prepared taking into account the special sensitivities of a few Member States concerning this important issue, because, as our experiences have shown, in some Member States the speedy implementation of the free movement of work force is not only hindered by economic difficulties, but often by political, sociopsychological or communication difficulties, too. The compromise proposals are also examining the issue in view of the pan-European interest, trying to take into account the aspirations and sensitivities of both old and new Member States. Therefore, we hope that the report, in this form, will receive the widest support during the vote of the Parliament.\nThank you for your attention, and I would like to thank all my colleagues, the political groups and the European Commission for their cooperation. It is not a coincidence that the content of the introduction given by Mr \u0160pidla has significantly relieved me of having to present the report in detail.

The free movement of workers forms an integral part of this. It now seems to me that fear has dominated the enlargement process in the old Member States and that fear of being elbowed out from the labour market, which is, or was, already under pressure, has led to restrictions in the free movement. I have always taken the view that decisions should not be taken on the basis of fear and that we would have served our own interests much better had we opened up this labour market from the word go. This is also evident from the results of the studies carried out in the United Kingdom and Sweden, although it should be noted that, in the United Kingdom, social security is not implemented in the way we would like it to be.\nWhat is this fear about? People fear being pushed out of the labour market, and in order to prevent this from happening, borders are closed, yet nothing could be further from the truth. Many arrive in our Member States and graft many hours for little pay. They are badly housed, set up their own one-man bands and compete with our small and medium-size enterprises.\nWhat should the answer be? Rather than resort to fear, the answer should be to open up the borders and make sure that proper checks are in place to monitor, not whether minimum wages are paid, but rather whether wages and working conditions as they have been laid down in the collective bargaining agreements are adhered to, and the conditions of safety at work as well.

De heer \u0150ry heeft zich heel consci\u00ebntieus van zijn taken gekweten. Hij heeft een goed verslag gemaakt.\nWij hebben in Europa welvaart gekregen dankzij de vier vrijheden die we in de Europese Unie hebben verankerd. Het vrije verkeer van werknemers vormt daarvan een integraal onderdeel. Ik stel nu vast dat bij de uitbreiding in de oude lidstaten de angst geregeerd heeft en dat de angst voor verdringingseffecten op de arbeidsmarkt - die toch al onder druk staat of stond - tot beperkingen van het vrije verkeer heeft geleid. Ik ben altijd van mening geweest dat angst een slechte raadgever is en dat we onszelf veel beter gediend zouden hebben, wanneer we die arbeidsmarkt van meet af aan helemaal hadden opengesteld. Dat kun je ook zien aan de resultaten van onderzoeken die in het Verenigd Koninkrijk en Zweden zijn verricht. Hierbij zij voor het Verenigd Koninkrijk nog gemeld dat de sociale zekerheid daar niet zo ge\u00efmplementeerd wordt als wij dat graag zouden hebben.\nWaarmee heeft die angst te maken? Die angst betreft de verdringing op de arbeidsmarkt die men denkt te kunnen voorkomen door het niet-openstellen van de grenzen. Niets is minder waar. Velen komen in onze lidstaten binnen en zij draaien vele uren voor weinig geld. Ze zijn slecht gehuisvest, vestigen zich als zelfstandigen zonder personeel en beconcurreren dan ons midden- en kleinbedrijf.\nWat moet het antwoord hierop zijn? Geen angst dus. Het antwoord moet zijn het openstellen van de grenzen en ervoor zorgen dat op een perfecte manier gecontroleerd wordt. Gecontroleerd op naleving, niet van het minimumloon, maar naleving van de lonen en arbeidsvoorwaarden zoals die in de CAO's zijn neergelegd.

For the preparation of the report thanks are due especially to Mr \u0150ry. The central feature of the resolution is the call to scrap the current transitional measures. Immediately after approval the amendment proposals began to come in, aimed at removing this prospective message from Parliament. It is remarkable how every one of the proposals begins with the words \u2018I support the free movement of workers, but \u2026\u2019. I therefore take the view that Parliament should approve the same version that has been approved by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.\nI would like to remind you that both employers\u2019 groups and the European Trade Union Confederation are requesting that the transitional measures be scrapped immediately. I am aware that some governments have not done so, and those that have done deserve our thanks. In response to the complaints we have heard today in speeches on the poor state of the European Union, I would like to say that neither the American nor the Chinese way should be models for us and that following the major crisis in Asia some years ago many states over there are thinking of developing the sort of structures that some persons here today are seeking to demolish.

Recognition of that right requires transitional periods to be lifted at the earliest opportunity. This does not imply promoting mass movements across the European Union. A distinction should be made between movements triggered by the need to seek employment and the free movement of persons which is a citizen\u2019s right.\nSecondly, the report rightly points out the benefits gained by countries that did not impose transitional periods and opened up their labour markets immediately. This is in line with the European Commission\u2019s view. It would, however, also be appropriate to consider how the free movement of people can either threaten or benefit the countries of origin of the citizens involved.\nThirdly, it is important that Member State citizens should not be discriminated against in favour of third-country nationals on the European Union\u2019s labour markets. Of course, this does not imply that we are indifferent to the interests of third-country nationals or that we do not wish to express solidarity with them too.\nFinally, the free movement of persons should be deemed a key feature of the European social model. Bearing in mind that Mr\u00a0\u0150ry\u2019s report and the position of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs comply with the aforementioned criteria, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe will vote in favour of the report.

It also constitutes discrimination, since the free movement of persons is a fundamental right guaranteed under Community law.\nAs is well known, this is a freedom that has existed for workers since the foundation of the European Community in 1957. That millions of people within the European Union should, in 2006, have ceased to enjoy that right is intolerable. In the course of the enlargement process, socially committed people of the Left \u2013 such as the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, for example \u2013 in the European Parliament insisted over and over again on the conditions being created that would enable, on the accession of new Member States, workers to be allowed freedom of movement without detrimental effects on society.\nPeople in both the old and new Member States are meant to benefit from enlargement, but instead we keep coming back to the issue of global competition. Whilst it was demonstrated, in the Scandinavian countries, that free movement does much to protect existing social standards, the federal government in Germany has extended the transitional periods without giving any indication whatever of what it intends to do with it by way of actually giving workers freedom of movement.\nFundamentally, my group agrees with Mr \u0150ry that we do not actually need any transitional periods at all, but this report is scarcely likely to promote awareness of the need for greater social responsibility on the European labour market. Our group\u2019s amendments to this end have so far been largely ineffective.\nI want to argue in favour of the freedom of movement being given to all workers living in the EU with immediate effect and of the introduction of social standards and minimum wages that keep people out of poverty.

The majority of governments, in continuing to restrict the number of workers from the new Member States, are in fact struggling with more serious problems concerning immigration from non-EU countries.\nThe partial opening of the labour market, for example, to construction workers, doormen and waiters, as France has proposed, does not testify to a readiness for the European fundamental freedoms. It is, instead, testimony to the low prestige of these professions, since unemployment among French youth is very high. This selective opening of the professional market, however, to a labour force with low qualifications means that this will be an incentive for many qualified workers to leave the new Member States, to change profession and immediately earn a higher salary. In the long term, however, this will weaken Europe\u2019s competitiveness.\nFinally, I call on those young French people who are protesting, disappointed in their government because of its discriminatory legislation against them, to come to the new Member States and to launch careers there.

It was asserted in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs that the failure of massive migratory flows to manifest themselves meant that the transitional arrangements guaranteed by treaty had to be abolished forthwith.\nTo that I say that the situation as experienced in such Member States as Germany, Austria or France is quite different. Wherever markedly higher rates of pay per hour apply, and wherever social security is guaranteed, there you will find migrants, and they need to be controlled, with illicit working and fictive self-employment being prevented. The effect of continued flows of migrants to countries with high unemployment is neither to create new jobs nor to make businesses more competitive.\nEven though this report is only an appeal rather than being legally binding, it could be misused to put certain countries in the dock, to whip up sentiment against them and to mount campaigns calling on consumers to boycott goods from them. That has indeed, already happened. Those who try to drive a wedge between the old Member States and the new ones imperil the concept of the EU being more than just a free trade area.\nI have helped to put forward some compromise amendments and am grateful to Mr \u0150ry, our rapporteur. Let there, then, be consideration of the curtailment of the transitional regulations, but let it be done on the basis of detailed analyses of the national labour markets. Regulations should also be drafted to ensure that workers from the new Member States are not put at a disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis those from third countries.\nWhat we need is for decisions to be properly thought out.

The end of the transitional arrangements will force employers to provide their employees with decent living conditions in accordance with social legislation in the host country. Social protection, decent housing, a decent salary, fair working hours \u2013 those are the basic rights that this freedom of movement should provide, and we will ensure that it does so.

I congratulate the rapporteur for preparing a very balanced report. The free movement of labour is not just one of the fundamental rights of the European Union, but is an expression of the solidarity between the old and new countries. Therefore, I am pleased to see that all of my colleagues show unanimous support for the abolition of the restrictions. As we react to the challenges of today's global economy, I believe that the abolition of obstacles to the movement of citizens and labour in the European Union's market is one of the main goals of the Lisbon Strategy and one of the factors stimulating economic growth.\nWith their accumulated human capital, the active workers from the new European Union Member States have the ability to stimulate long-term economic growth. Moreover, the market may become more effective, as foreign workers usually react more actively to the regional differences of economic opportunities. Having admitted workers from the new states, Ireland, the United Kingdom and Sweden only benefited. The aforementioned Member States are noted for rapid economic growth, reduced unemployment and increased employment compared to other states. In addition, it can be concluded that citizens of the new Member States have complemented, but not replaced citizens of the old Member States in the labour markets of the latter. Statistical data from European Union Member States indicates that immigration from third countries exceeds the flow of immigration in the heart of the European Union. We should congratulate and rejoice in the decision of those countries which have decided to open their labour markets to the new European Union countries from May this year. I would say: shame on the governments of Austria, which is holding the EU Presidency, and Germany, for their phobias, for their inability to discuss this matter with their own citizens.

In its initial version this document already rightly indicated that the impossibility of being legally employed in the majority of the so-called old Member States fosters irregular employment and the exploitation of workers.\nMr\u00a0\u0150ry also appropriately highlights the fact that in certain European Union Member States more restrictions are currently imposed on the movement of workers from the new Member States than was the case when the Treaty on Accession was signed. He also points out that there are issues concerning preferential treatment for so-called long-term resident third-country nationals to the detriment of Union citizens from the 10\u00a0new Member States.\nIn addition, the report\u2019s author clearly states that there have been no negative social or economic consequences for the countries that have already opened up their labour markets. On the contrary, the reduction of the irregular employment of foreigners has resulted in additional income for national budgets.\nMr\u00a0\u0150ry\u2019s initial draft was also presented to Parliament\u2019s Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for discussion and a subsequent vote, and the draft was improved considerably by this process. This is particularly true of paragraph\u00a01. In the version tabled by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, Parliament comes out clearly in support of the citizens and their right to the fundamental freedoms enshrined in the Treaties.\nI strongly believe that this is the stance the European Parliament must adopt. The House should make a clear and unequivocal statement defending fundamental rights and freedoms. It should stand up for the Community\u2019s interests and for the interests of all European Union citizens, over and above specific national concerns.

Those who bar certain people from the market must know that they can expect, as a quite natural response to their action, the coming into being of illegal markets. People who live near to a border between states will not be prevented from offering their labour on either side of it, and so, over recent years, whole new categories of workers are putting themselves on the streets, with artisans and building workers offering their services, and this is proving to be a successful game for them; they are much in demand. People are working under the pretence of being self-employed or, quite simply, illegally, without social security and for less than the minimum wages laid down by law.\nHow mendacious, then, of people such as the representatives of the German building trade, to demand \u2013 or so we read \u2013 that the transitional periods be extended! Why is it that some employers\u2019 representatives want these discriminatory restrictions imposed on the citizens of other Member States? Is it not, perhaps, that they are thereby enabled to make money from cheap seasonal labour, from the putative self-employed, and from those working in the black market? Why, too, I wonder, do the national employers\u2019 representatives not campaign with more energy against this sort of exploitation? Why do they make social security dependent on nationality? Might it not be that they do so out of the simple desire for mass appeal, since it is only the citizens of their own country who cast votes, so that what matters to them is not the principle itself but their own success on election day?\nThree countries so far have opened up their labour markets to the EU\u2019s new Member States, and their experiences of it have been positive.

In his report, he focuses on the real effects of citizens from the new Member States entering the labour markets of the fifteen old Member States. He supports the premise that it is not the Member States and their interactions that pose the real problem to European competitiveness, but rather external competitors such as India and China.\nThe report considers the following facts: firstly, workers from the new Member States nowhere exceed 2% of the host country population; secondly, internal migration within the old Member States is four times greater than internal migration from the new Member States and, thirdly, migration from third countries significantly exceeds total internal migration within the EU. There is no doubt that, in addition to the German, Austrian and French attitudes to the transitional period, divergent opinions also exist among the new Member States, as the transitional period has gradually become a\u00a0sensitive political issue there as well.\nWe adopted the transitional measures during the accession talks, as part of the deal. As time goes by, however, this has become a\u00a0sensitive issue in the politics of the old Member States, which are increasingly perceived as discriminatory. Discussions over the Services Directive have already revealed absurd situations in connection with transitional periods and now, with regard to Directive 109, it also appears that a\u00a0legal conflict has arisen with the preferential rules clause.

Of course, the efficient operation of the internal market is based upon the free movement of capital, goods, services and workers. The free movement of capital and goods has been implemented relatively successfully.

We are constantly hearing about the importance of competition and adopting measures against protectionism \u2013 but how well is this working in practice? As far as capital and goods are concerned, some countries are particularly consistent in their advocacy of competition and are even opening their markets to cheap goods from Asia. But those who constantly lecture us on the importance of competition and the drawbacks of protectionism as regards goods and capital are at the same time closing their service and labour markets. Is that not protectionism?\n2006 has been designated the European Year for Workers\u2019 Mobility and, yet, it is in this very year that some Member States are planning to extend their transitional periods. So, I ask you, how are we supposed to explain that to the citizens of the European Union? With a great deal of difficulty. On the other hand, it is plain to see that all those who have opened up their markets are making progress and their economic development is noteworthy.\nAny country which decides to further close its labour market must do so, in my view, on a rational basis and acting as an individual, rather than as part of a bloc of countries.

The free movement of workers still needs to be implemented and, to that end, it is vital to lift the restrictions imposed when the new Member States acceded as soon as possible.\nThis distrust is misplaced, because we can see that, in the 15 countries where the restrictions have been lifted, there have been no massive influxes. Surprisingly, only 2% of European citizens work outside their country, whereas a third of Americans live in a state other than the one in which they were born. The invasion is nothing but a fantasy, and the mobility of workers is a challenge. Mr\u00a0\u0150ry's report sets the objective of lifting the restrictions by 2009, and I support this objective. The French Prime Minister has also indicated that France would anticipate this movement by lifting these restrictions in a gradual and controlled manner.\nThe resolution adopted by the European Trade Union Confederation in December 2005 opens up paths that reconcile the opening up of borders with appropriate protection. The amendments adopted by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs go down this route, in order to ensure that employment law is applied in the Member States, specifically to ensure that Community standards are implemented, in particular those in the posting of workers directive, and in order to look into the creation of a European centre to coordinate the inspection services of the Member States. By producing standardised statistics on Community migration, we will be able to set up the toolkit for a social Europe within the Union, which will confirm that the free movement of workers must not be synonymous with dumping or the lowest common social denominator, but must be a factor in the economic dynamism that will enable us to iron out pockets of under-employment.", "lang": "FR", "original": "Roselyne Bachelot-Narquin (PPE-DE). - Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, mes chers coll\u00e8gues, dans les moments de doute, l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne doit revenir \u00e0 ses principes de base.

On that day, I stood, together with Dr\u00a0Otto\u00a0von\u00a0Habsburg, on the border between Slovenia and Austria and took part in a solemn ceremony. What was being celebrated was the fact that, as Slovenia became a member of the EU, a town that had undergone a post-war division into two parts \u2013 one of which came to belong to Austria and the other to Slovenia \u2013 was now being reunited.\nThe symbolism was clear and, standing there, I felt strongly that people did not feel that they were entering something new but felt that they were being reunited with something of which they had always been a part. That, moreover, is the way things are. The EU\u2019s ten new Member States are ten old countries of Europe. It is just that Communism had kidnapped them for 50 years, and now they are finally reunited with us.\nIn the run-up to this reunification, Sweden\u2019s Social Democrats had painted horrific pictures of how our country would be invaded by foreign workers who would dump our wages and exploit our social benefits. I and my party fought in the Swedish Parliament to prevent our country from introducing transitional rules. We wanted the new countries, which had for so long suffered under Communism, now to enjoy the freedoms brought about by EU membership.\nWe refused to accept the Social Democrats\u2019 propaganda and demonstrated the nature of real solidarity. We won the battle, and Sweden never introduced any transitional rules. Evaluations carried out now show unambiguously that Sweden has not in the least been exposed to the social dumping invoked by the Social Democrats as a scare tactic. Instead, freedom of movement has only had positive effects on the Swedish economy. The other countries that did not introduce transitional rules have also had the same experience.\nI have to say, moreover, that it was with great disappointment that I learned of several countries\u2019 decision to extend their transitional rules. To do so when the scenarios invoked did not materialise is unreasonable. The only correct thing to do is to refrain from introducing transitional rules, and I hope that, in future, Europe will be influenced more by reason than by fear.\n(Applause)", "lang": "SV", "original": "Anna Ibrisagic (PPE-DE). \u2013 Herr talman!

However, we also know that this freedom is only valid and fully established only for citizens of the fifteen old Member States, while citizens of the eight new Member States, which became members on 1 May 2004, are subject to the provisions of the transition period and this transition period may last as long as seven years in accordance with the 2+3+2 year formula. As if this were not enough, according to certain EU directives, in some cases, long-term residents from third countries enjoy rights, which give them a more privileged status than citizens of the eight new Member States, to live and enter the labour market in fifteen EU Member States. And this means that by demonstrating solidarity with workers from third countries, we are discriminating against workers from the new EU Member States.\nAs the first transition period ends on 30 April, we have a perfect opportunity to evaluate its consequences and effects on the economies of both the fifteen old Member States and the eight new Member States and to make appropriate decisions. True, we lack statistical data on immigration in the heart of the Community. It is difficult to come to objective conclusions, but today, it is already obvious that immigration from third countries greatly exceeds the flow of immigration at the heart of the EU, that is in the fifteen old Member States and the whole of the enlarged EU. It is also obvious that the countries which opened their labour markets to citizens of the new countries have really only benefited, while the transition periods encourage illegal work, unfair working conditions, discrimination against and exploitation of migrant workers.

It is appropriate to pose a key question, namely should labour markets be opened when there are job vacancies and a shortage of indigenous workers, in other words a shortage of people willing to work? Allow me to reiterate. I referred to a lack of people willing to work, not to the unemployed. Alternatively, should labour markets be opened up so as to generate economic growth, which will lead to the creation of new jobs? My convictions and experience to date indicate that opening up the labour market of a given country will generate economic growth and new jobs.\nWe should bear in mind that increased employment and job creation will only be possible if we introduce genuine economic reforms, not just cosmetic changes. Entrepreneurs need to be convinced of the need for such reforms, but above all we must win over the trade union sector. Although these changes tend to be painful in the short term, they have a positive effect in the medium and long term.\nI shall now move on to a very opportune question, as we are involved in negotiations at WTO level. To what extent and at what pace should world trade be liberalised so as to achieve economic growth within the EU and create new jobs? We would then avoid becoming simply an area where imported goods are consumed, with limited capacity for production.\nFinally, it is important to prepare for flexibility and mobility of the labour force. I believe that resources from the national and Union budgets must be devoted to reskilling and training for new occupations.

Debate Information\n\nThis parliamentary debate addressed transitional arrangements restricting the free movement of workers on EU labour markets, focusing on restrictions affecting workers from the eight countries that joined the EU in 2004 (EU-8 states). The debate featured 30 substantive contributions from MEPs and Commission representatives, examining whether these temporary restrictions should be maintained or abolished. The discussion took place during a critical period when the first two-year transitional period was ending and member states faced decisions about extending restrictions.\n\n## 2. Executive Summary\n\n**Commission Position**\nCommissioner Vladim\u00edr \u0160pidla presented strong evidence supporting the removal of transitional restrictions, arguing that \"countries that did not introduce restrictions after May 2004 have recorded stronger economic growth, lower levels of unemployment and higher levels of employment.\" He emphasized that worker registration numbers remained very low (seldom reaching 1% of host country population) and that \"the free movement of persons is a basic principle applying to all citizens, and any limitation on it whatsoever can only be temporary.\"\n\n**Overwhelming Support for Lifting Restrictions**\nThe vast majority of speakers supported ending transitional arrangements, viewing them as discriminatory and counterproductive. Rapporteur Csaba \u0150ry (PPE-DE) concluded that \"the most advantageous course of action for the European Union and its Member States is for the affected governments to lift the system of transitional measures restricting free employment within the Union, as soon as possible.\" He argued that \"fears concerning mass migration have proved to be groundless.\"\n\n**Evidence-Based Arguments**\nMultiple speakers cited empirical evidence from countries that opened their markets. Jean Lambert (Verts/ALE) noted UK data showing that \"40% of registered Polish workers were already in the country,\" demonstrating people's desire to work legally. \u0160ar\u016bnas Birutis (ALDE) praised countries that opened their markets, stating \"Ireland, the United Kingdom and Sweden only benefited. The aforementioned Member States are noted for rapid economic growth, reduced unemployment and increased employment.\"\n\n**Exploitation and Discrimination Concerns**\nSeveral MEPs highlighted how restrictions created worse conditions for workers. Elisabeth Schroedter argued that \"transitional periods do not keep the migrant workers out. They come all the same and work either on the black market or making themselves out to be self-employed.\" Jean Louis Cottigny (PSE) emphasized that restrictions must be lifted while \"strengthening checks to ensure workers don't become victims of exploitation.\"\n\n**Fundamental Rights Arguments**\nMany speakers framed the issue in terms of basic EU principles. Jan Jerzy Ku\u0142akowski (ALDE) stated that \"the free movement of persons is one of the four fundamental freedoms of the single market and every European Union citizen's right.\" Anna Ibrisagic (PPE-DE) emphasized that \"the EU's ten new Member States are ten old countries of Europe. It is just that Communism had kidnapped them for 50 years, and now they are finally reunited with us.\"\n\n**Minority Opposition**\nA small minority defended maintaining restrictions. Thomas Mann (PPE-DE) argued that \"continued flows of migrants to countries with high unemployment is neither to create new jobs nor to make businesses more competitive.\" Karin J\u00f6ns (PSE) defended Germany's cautious approach, citing its \"12% unemployment rate rather than a mere 5%\" compared to countries like the UK, Sweden, and Ireland.\n\n**Compromise Positions**\nSome speakers sought middle ground. Ole Christensen (PSE) supported \"slowly phasing out the restrictions\" while maintaining monitoring systems, arguing that \"transitional arrangements must not unnecessarily hamper freedom of movement.\" Roselyne Bachelot-Narquin (PPE-DE) supported setting \"2009 as the target date for lifting all restrictions\" with proper social protections.\n\n**Key Proposals**\nThe debate generated several concrete proposals: immediate abolition of all restrictions (majority position), gradual phase-out by 2009 with enhanced worker protections, improved enforcement of the Posting of Workers Directive, standardized EU-wide statistics on worker mobility, and enhanced social dialogue at European and national levels.\n\nThe overwhelming parliamentary consensus favored ending discriminatory transitional arrangements that were seen as violating fundamental EU principles while failing to achieve their protective aims, instead creating conditions for worker exploitation and unfair competition.", "src_model": "claude", "model_type": "claude", "model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "structured": true, "incremental": false, "hierarchical": false, "grouped": false, "shuffle": false, "prompt": false, "lang": "english"}
