They come all the same and work either on the black market or making themselves out to be self-employed. The transitional rules are forcing people to work outside the law and thereby to become even cheaper labour and the object of brutal exploitation without the protection of labour law, without social security and without the certainty of actually being paid.\nOutside the law\u2019s protection, people have no rights. There is even greater pressure on wages in vulnerable areas and in the labour markets affected, for wages agreements have no effect on the black market, which operates according to its own rules and cannot be monitored. Those governments that still hold to transitional periods are encouraging people to work outside of the law and on its fringes, thereby doing much more damage to social cohesion.\nIf workers are to be enabled to avail themselves of their rights, then their employment needs to be put on a legal footing. Greater transparency brings with it better monitoring of labour markets. We must organise the European market in its de facto existing form on the basis of \u2018equal pay for the same work under the same conditions in the same place\u2019, thereby giving national and regional wage negotiations added weight and the same social rights to all. What that means, for the German Government for example, is that it must, without further ado, extend the Posting of Workers Directive to all vulnerable areas, for we know that, in Germany and Austria, the transitional periods for the services sector are dependent on those applicable to freedom of movement. The only really effective protection against things going wrong on the labour market is pro-active measures to bring it into order.\n(Applause)", "lang": "EN", "original": "Elisabeth Schroedter, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . \u2013 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the Group of the Greens is in favour of freedom of movement, and endorses Mr \u0150ry\u2019s even-handed report, for transitional periods, popular though they are with our own people, promise no success.\nAccording to the German newspapers, the government had decided against allowing cheap workers into the country on the grounds that it wanted to protect its own labour market from an influx of cheap migrant labour from the neighbouring countries, but that is a load of nonsense; the transitional periods do not keep the migrant workers out.
