{"speaker": "Derek Roland Clark,", "english": "Derek Roland Clark, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . \u2013 Mr President, I am astonished that there should be a report on this at all. I thought the EU was all about the free movement of goods, services and labour. What do we find? When the ten new Member States joined in 2004, they did not get parity. Only three Member States of the previous EU of 15 admitted their workers without restriction: Ireland, Sweden and the United Kingdom. This becomes very odd when you consider that these are three of the most reluctant EU Member States. Ireland rejected the Nice Treaty the first time and only accepted it later due to impressive gerrymandering in a second referendum. Sweden only joined the EU after a bare 1% majority in its referendum. As for the United Kingdom, you know all about us. None of you exactly welcomed Prime Minister Blair last December, at the end of what you all considered to have been a rotten United Kingdom Presidency. You were right. You even threw out his seven-year budget \u2013 his precious rescue attempt \u2013 with an overwhelming vote on the B\u00f6ge report. So I am now in the very happy position of saying to you: do as the United Kingdom, Ireland and Sweden have done. Never mind transitional arrangements; obey your own rules; open your borders; take your share of, say, Polish workers \u2013 in the United Kingdom we have 250\u00a0000 of them, and they are not all plumbers.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Derek Roland Clark, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . \u2013 Mr President, I am astonished that there should be a report on this at all.
