(CS) I have listened with interest to the debate on Mr \u0150ry\u2019s report and I must say it has been exceptionally far-reaching, throwing light from many angles and many viewpoints onto the issue of freedom of movement for workers. Allow me to add to the debate one further strand that has not received mention. A transitional period has formed part of every enlargement of the EU, and every enlargement has been dominated by major fears, and these fears have, in every instance, failed to materialise.\nLadies and gentlemen, the current Accession Treaty therefore provides for a gradual system made up of several stages, designed so that the final stage, in 2011, will be as short as possible. I am therefore delighted to be able to say now that, from 1 May this year, Europe will be making significant progress towards complete freedom of movement for workers.\nLadies and gentlemen, I would like once again to thank you for a debate that has been very serious, very far-reaching and often very sharp \u2013 just as befits this serious topic.\n(Applause)", "lang": "EN", "original": "Vladim\u00edr \u0160pidla, Member of the Commission .
