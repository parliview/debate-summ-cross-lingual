{"speaker": "James Hugh Allister (NI). \u2013", "english": "James Hugh Allister (NI). \u2013 Mr President, I welcome these reports because protecting regional specialities is right and necessary. Regions have a right to exploit and protect such specialities for their own economic benefit.\nI note that it is estimated that, in those Member States where this is done, around EUR\u00a05\u00a0billion a year is raised, in terms of added value, by promoting such geographical indications. Of course, there is also a knock-on effect in terms of impact and job creation and in population retention in rural areas.\nMy sole regret is that, to date, my region \u2013 Northern Ireland \u2013 has not yet availed itself of this facility, though I would have to say, biased as I am, that we are rich in such commodities.\nUlster beef, which all Europeans will soon be able to savour again when the beef ban is lifted, has a taste and quality which makes it renowned and which caused the Greenfield label to be synonymous with the highest quality. Our wheaten and soda breads are must-taste delicacies and Armagh Bramley apples have a very distinct reputation.\nI would therefore call on the British Government in this debate to avail itself forthwith of the opportunities available under these regulations.\nIn terms of these regulations, a complaint which I have encountered is that the process of application is unduly burdensome and bureaucratic. I would therefore make a plea that the maximum effort should be made to simplify the process so that regional products may be protected and promoted more swiftly, and I welcome what the Commissioner had to say in that regard.\nIn the context of the WTO, it is vital that Europe defends the rights accrued under those regulations and does not give in to the pressures coming from third countries. I agree strongly with our rapporteur that the EU must use all its clout and diplomatic skill to defend geographical indications. Whilst we should take encouragement from the WTO Dispute Settlement Body's rejection of recent attacks by the United States and Australia, we cannot afford any sense of complacency.", "lang": "EN", "original": "James Hugh Allister (NI). \u2013 Mr President, I welcome these reports because protecting regional specialities is right and necessary.
