The family recipe, the local flavour, the hand-made product, the quality and unique character need our protection to keep our regions as rich as they are now.\nBut what use will all this valuable work be if, concurrently, we allow GM to infiltrate our crops, and thus our food and produce? Here we are trying to protect the individuality of products and the uniqueness of local ingredients. How can we claim that our ingredients are local if they are all modified in a laboratory? Those seeds are certainly not your family's variation; they are an identikit Monsanto seed of a particular batch number, exactly the same seed as millions of others around the globe.\nHow can we then claim that our products are unique, that they are our rich regional flavour, or that they are from our region at all? Would honesty not require us to label our produce as 'Monsanto Corporation, produced in St Louis, Missouri'? We must allow regions to choose whether they wish to be GM and we must protect those which do not.\nWe must not only appreciate and preserve local specialities but also the farmers' markets at which they are still sometimes locally sold. We must ensure that, in regulating food marketing, we do not kill off the remaining traditional local farmers' markets.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Kathy Sinnott (IND/DEM). \u2013 Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur for helping to protect regional individuality and rural self-sufficiency.\nEurope has such rich and varied produce and food, and we certainly need to protect that from trade liberalisation absolutists.
