The user is asking about the \"President\" as the speaker, but I need to check if the President is mentioned in the summary.\n\nLooking through the sections of the summary, under the \"Commission Position and Context\" section, the Commission's representative is Commissioner Neelie Kroes. Then, in the \"Parliamentary Response and Support\" section, the rapporteur is Friedrich-Wilhelm Graefe zu Baringdorf. Other sections mention various speakers from different groups like PPE-DE, PSE, ALDE, UEN, etc. There's also mention of Daniel Stro\u017e, Witold Tomczak, Andrzej Tomczak Zapa\u0142owski, and others. \n\nWait, the user is asking about the \"President.\" In the context of a parliamentary debate, the \"President\" might refer to the President of the European Parliament or the President of the Commission. However, in the summary provided, the Commission's representative is Commissioner Neelie Kroes, and there's no mention of the President of the European Parliament. The \"President\" might be a specific person, but the summary doesn't list any contributions from a \"President.\" \n\nLooking through the entire summary again, I don't see any section where the President is speaking. The key speakers mentioned are the Commission's Commissioner, rapporteurs, and various members from different political groups. The Commission's response is from Kroes, and there's no mention of a President making a contribution. \n\nSince the user's instruction says that if there are no points attributed to the speaker, I should respond with an empty string.

Mr President, I want to start by thanking Mr\u00a0Graefe\u00a0zu\u00a0Baringdorf and the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for all the work they have carried out on both reports, the first on protection of geographical indications and designations of origin and the second on traditional specialities guaranteed.\nThe Commission appreciates the efficient organisation of your work, which has enabled adoption of the reports within a short period of time. In my opening statement I address both reports, thereby focusing on the general background that has led to these Commission proposals.\nFirstly, as regards the report on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin, almost 14 years ago the European Community established a voluntary system of geographical indications for agricultural products and foodstuffs other than wines and spirits. Since 1993, over 700 names have been registered. Almost 300 requests are currently waiting for registration; this gives an idea of the success of this system.\nThis success may explain the interest shown by our trade partners in this regulation. The conclusions of the recent WTO panels on cases brought by the US and Australia impose on us the obligation to open the Community scheme to direct applications and objections from individuals in third countries.\nThis is the fundamental reason for the proposal you have on the table: to ensure conformity with the conclusions of the panels. On the basis of experience gained in managing the registration process, we realised that the current system would not survive an additional burden of direct applications from operators in third countries. Thus we had to streamline the system and make it more efficient.\nIf we simply conform to WTO rules without increasing the efficiency of the functioning of the system, the whole approval process could come to a standstill. I should add that, in order to avoid any risk of a new complaint at WTO level, the procedure for third-country and EU denominations should be as similar as possible.\nWe have all been surprised by the extent of the changes required under the WTO ruling. While the Community won the panel on the substantive trademark issue, we lost on the procedural questions. We also included one clear policy change, namely promoting the use of Community logos for enhancing the credibility of the system. Apart from that, however, there are no policy initiatives, as the primary purpose of the proposal is to conform to the WTO panel findings within the deadline.\nThe many demands and suggestions for policy development set out in the amendments adopted in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development are issues that deserve more time to be adequately addressed.\nLet me turn now to the other proposal, which concerns traditional specialities guaranteed. In spite of the modest number of products registered, some producers have shown their interest in this regulation. There are only 50 names registered as traditional specialities guaranteed, but there are 19 applications pending at Community level and a number of others under examination in the Member States. This regulation has not been amended since its adoption in 1992. The procedures have been designed neither for 25 nor for 27 Member States, or for handling a significant number of applications.\nThere is a similar need to streamline and standardise the content of applications so that more efficient procedures are adopted and so that producers who make the effort to engage in quality schemes are not disappointed by approvals being delayed for several years.\nI also consider it important to correct a number of inconsistencies and to reflect substantial advances in legal drafting standards since 1992. At the same time, we propose simplifications and clarifications and other improvements identical to those proposed for geographical indications and designations of origin.\nFinally, we are keen to make it clear in this regulation that WTO rules are respected and to forestall any criticism.\nIn conclusion, these proposals achieve WTO conformity and introduce limited but necessary housekeeping that is designed to streamline and clarify procedures. We can thereby underpin the mechanisms and better serve producers and consumers who rely on denominations.

Let me start by reading through the summary carefully.\n\nThe debate is about two Council regulation proposals regarding agricultural products and foodstuffs, specifically traditional specialities and geographical indications protection. The date is March 15, 2006, and there are 22 speakers. The user is asking about Neelie Kroes, who is the Commission's representative here.\n\nLooking at the \"Commission Position and Context\" section, it says that Commissioner Neelie Kroes opened the debate. She explained the primary driver for the proposals: compliance with WTO panel conclusions after challenges by the US and Australia. She mentions that over 700 geographical indications have been registered since 1993 with commercial value over \u20ac10 billion. Her quote is: \"If we simply conform to WTO rules without increasing the efficiency of the functioning of the system, the whole approval process could come to a standstill\" [Kroes, 2006-03-15].\n\nThe Commission's approach is limited in scope, focusing on WTO compliance rather than broader policy reforms, with deeper changes deferred for future consideration in a comprehensive agricultural quality policy review.\n\nNow, the user wants only the points attributed to Neelie Kroes. The summary mentions her opening the debate, explaining the WTO compliance as the main driver, the stats about 700 GIs and \u20ac10B value, and her warning about the approval process stalling if efficiency isn't improved. Also, the Commission's approach is limited scope, focusing on WTO compliance, not broader reforms.\n\nI need to make sure I don't include anything from other speakers. The user specified that contributions from others shouldn't be included. So, only what's directly from Kroes.\n\nSo the main points would be:\n\n1. The proposals are driven by the need to comply with WTO panel conclusions after challenges from the US and Australia.\n2. Highlighting the existing 700+ GIs with significant commercial value (\u20ac10B).\n3. Emphasizing the need for efficiency in the system to prevent the approval process from stalling.\n4. The Commission's approach is limited to WTO compliance, not broader policy changes, which are to be addressed later in a comprehensive review.\n\nI should check if there's anything else from her in other sections. The Commission Response and Accepted Amendments section mentions her concluding by accepting amendments and clarifying technical issues, but the user is asking for her arguments during the debate, not the Commission's response. The summary says she \"concluded by accepting specific amendments\" but the user's query is about her contributions during the debate, not the outcome. So the main points are from her opening statement and the Commission's position.\n\nSo the answer should list those points. Make sure not to include other speakers' points. For example, the rapporteur's points are from Graefe zu Baringdorf, not Kroes. The user wants only what's from Neelie Kroes.\n</think>\n\nThe Commission's proposals are driven by the need to comply with WTO panel rulings following challenges from the United States and Australia. The Commission highlights that over 700 geographical indications have been registered since 1993, with commercial value exceeding \u20ac10 billion. Commissioner Kroes warns that without improving the system's efficiency, the approval process could stall.

Her colleague, Commissioner Fischer\u00a0Boel, cannot be present, but that should not prevent us from making this a good discussion.\nThe Commissioner said that this is not the beginning of a legislative process, but that we are just responding to a request from the WTO. The beginnings of a legislative framework for quality assurance came in\u00a01992, as much as 14\u00a0years ago, but, of course, that was not the start of high-quality production in the areas that were protected at that time. It was rather the case that, as with organic farming, the matter of the products at issue here had been introduced onto the market long ago, over a period of decades, by producers, and proceeded to gain consumer acceptance. There then followed harmonisation and streamlining measures, clarifications and safeguards.\nWith regard to quality policy, there are only two areas within agriculture that are designated \u2018quality\u2019. These are the area under discussion today, and organic farming. Everything else is covered by the concept of food safety. Here, however, we are talking about and focusing on quality, in particular.\nAs the Commissioner has already mentioned, this is no trifling matter, it is a billion-euro business. Granting regions and businesses protection of geographical indications, designations of origin or specialities creates genuine added value. It is understandable that others will covet this added value.\nThe dispute is with the United States, in particular \u2013 and when I say United States, I mean the large multinationals. These are looking very carefully at whether the products now being protected here as designations of origin can perhaps be incorporated into their empires as trademarks. In exactly the same way as Coca-Cola, they want to include Feta cheese, Parmesan, Spreew\u00e4lder Gurken (Spreewald Gherkins), Karlsbader Oblaten (Karlsbad Wafers), Th\u00fcringer Rostbratwurst, and also Tiroler Speck \u2013 from both Austria and South Tyrol (S\u00fcdtiroler Speck) \u2013 with their trademarks; not because they consider them particularly good, but because there is money to be made from them. That is why they, too, have joined the discussion in the WTO, and now we are presenting our response.\nThe good thing about the discussion is that the WTO has said from the outset, as a matter of principle, that our rules are in accordance with its own rules. What is not in accordance with its rules, and where improvements need to be made, is the issue of third country access to these protected quality indications. We are making good this shortcoming, and I also think that this makes sense.\nI should also like to point out, however, that another kind of desire also comes to the fore here. For example, producers of Parma ham or Tiroler Speck may think to themselves: if we were to buy the pigs on the wider market, it would be cheaper than having to produce them in the region or stipulating that the regions from which we obtain them be specifically geared towards such production \u2013 because this would naturally mean an increase in production costs.\nIf we do not do that, however, we run the risk, in the international discussions within the WTO \u2013 and the multinationals will keep on and on at us about it \u2013 of lapsing into arbitrariness, of undermining our own quality indications and thus ultimately losing the protection. This being the case, it would be a highly dubious business to believe it is possible to buy raw materials at cheaper prices, and that is why we have stipulated and are stipulating that there be a special relationship between the regions in this regard.\nBy way of conclusion, I should like to say a few words of a procedural nature. As the Commissioner is also aware, the Council has already made a decision. We are once again holding a discussion here despite the fact that everything has already been decided, and that is unacceptable. The matter has to be debated first. I hope that we can also make that clear in the Constitution once it has been ratified.\nWe considered referring this matter back to committee out of pure annoyance, because, once again, we have been overlooked and our expert work is being ignored. However, we believe that this would project an outward lack of unity on our part in the WTO proceedings, and enable others to say: aha, they are not even agreed among themselves. Since we are in favour of strengthening and securing the EU position, we shall let it pass, but we should like to make clear where the Council\u2019s weaknesses lie in some regards, and would ask Commissioner Kroes to communicate that in her role as Commissioner, so that she reconsiders her decisions.\n(Applause)", "lang": "DE", "original": "Friedrich-Wilhelm Graefe zu Baringdorf (Verts/ALE), Berichterstatter . \u2013 Herr Pr\u00e4sident!

Hier kann in den Regionen und in den Betrieben durch einen Schutz, der ihnen f\u00fcr diese geografischen oder Ursprungsbezeichnungen oder Spezialit\u00e4ten gew\u00e4hrt wird, ein echter Mehrwert geschaffen werden. Dass diese h\u00f6here Wertsch\u00f6pfung, die sich daraus ergibt, aber auch Begehrlichkeiten weckt, ist verst\u00e4ndlich.\nWir haben zum einen die Auseinandersetzung insbesondere mit den USA \u2013 und wenn ich USA sage, meine ich die gro\u00dfen Multis\u00a0\u2013, die sehr aufmerksam darauf schauen, ob sie das, was hier jetzt als Ursprungsbezeichnungen gesch\u00fctzt wird, nicht als Marken in ihr Imperium \u00fcbernehmen k\u00f6nnen. Genau wie Coca Cola m\u00f6chten sie Feta-K\u00e4se, Parmesan, Spreewaldgurken, Karlsbader Oblaten, Th\u00fcringer Rostbratwurst, aber auch den Tiroler Speck \u2013 sowohl den \u00f6sterreichischen als auch den S\u00fcdtiroler Speck \u2013 in ihre Marken aufnehmen, nicht, weil sie das besonders sch\u00f6n finden, sondern weil daran zu verdienen ist. Deswegen sind sie auch in die Auseinandersetzung in der WTO gegangen, und jetzt reagieren wir darauf.\nDas Gute an der Auseinandersetzung ist, dass die WTO zun\u00e4chst einmal vom Grundsatz her gesagt hat, dass ihre und unsere Regeln konform sind. Was nicht konform ist oder wo nachgebessert werden muss, ist die Frage des Zugangs der Drittl\u00e4nder zu diesen gesch\u00fctzten Qualit\u00e4tsbezeichnungen. Das holen wir hier nach, und ich finde das auch vern\u00fcnftig.\nLassen Sie mich aber auch noch darauf hinweisen, dass es eine andere Begehrlichkeit in dieser Frage gibt. Wenn man zum Beispiel Parmaschinken oder Tiroler Speck herstellt, dann k\u00f6nnte man ja meinen: Wenn man jetzt die Schweine auf dem allgemeinen Markt kauft, dann sind sie billiger, als wenn wir sie in der Region erzeugen m\u00fcssen oder eine spezielle Ausrichtung in den Regionen, aus denen wir sie beziehen, vorschreiben, weil das nat\u00fcrlich eine Verteuerung der Produktion bringt.\nWenn wir das aber nicht tun, laufen wir Gefahr, dass wir in der internationalen Auseinandersetzung, in den WTO-Diskussionen \u2013 die Multis werden damit noch lange nicht Ruhe geben \u2013 in eine Beliebigkeit kommen, dass wir unsere eigenen Qualit\u00e4tsbezeichnungen aush\u00f6hlen und damit irgendwann den Schutz verlieren. Dann war es ein verdammt zweifelhaftes Gesch\u00e4ft, wenn man meint, man k\u00f6nnte die Rohstoffe billiger kaufen. Deswegen haben wir festgelegt und wollen es festlegen, dass hier eine besondere Beziehung zwischen den Regionen bestehen muss.\nIch m\u00f6chte zum Schluss noch etwas zum Verfahren sagen. Sie wissen auch, Frau Kommissarin, dass der Rat bereits beschlossen hat. Wir diskutieren hier wieder einmal, obwohl schon alles entschieden ist, und das ist nicht zul\u00e4ssig. Sie haben die Diskussion abzuwarten. Ich hoffe, dass wir das in der Verfassung auch deutlich machen k\u00f6nnen, wenn sie denn einmal durch ist.\nWir haben uns \u00fcberlegt, ob wir hier nicht aus reinem \u00c4rger eine R\u00fcckverweisung in den Ausschuss vornehmen sollten, weil wir wieder einmal hintangestellt worden sind und Sie auf unsere inhaltlich qualifizierte Arbeit \u00fcberhaupt keine R\u00fccksicht nehmen. Wir sind aber der Ansicht, dass wir dann in dem WTO-Verfahren nach au\u00dfen hin Uneinigkeit demonstrieren w\u00fcrden und andere sagen k\u00f6nnten: Aha, die sind sich nicht einmal selbst einig. Wir sind daf\u00fcr, dass wir die EU-Position st\u00e4rken und absichern. Deswegen lassen wir es durchgehen, m\u00f6chten aber in einigen Punkten doch einmal deutlich machen, wo der Rat Schw\u00e4chen zeigt, und bitten Sie als Kommissarin dann, das auch zu vermitteln, damit Sie bei Ihren Entscheidungen noch einmal \u00fcberlegen.\n(Beifall)", "agenda_item": "Agricultural products and foodstuffs as traditional specialities guaranteed \u2013 Protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060315-ITEM-014", "intervention_id": "3-347", "summary_english": "{\n\"headline\": \"EU Responds to WTO Challenge on Protected Food Designations While Strengthening Regional Quality Requirements\",\n\"issueSum\": \"The speaker addresses the EU's response to a WTO challenge regarding protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products.

Her colleague, Commissioner Fischer\u00a0Boel, cannot be present, but that should not prevent us from making this a good discussion.\nThe Commissioner said that this is not the beginning of a legislative process, but that we are just responding to a request from the WTO. The beginnings of a legislative framework for quality assurance came in\u00a01992, as much as 14\u00a0years ago, but, of course, that was not the start of high-quality production in the areas that were protected at that time. It was rather the case that, as with organic farming, the matter of the products at issue here had been introduced onto the market long ago, over a period of decades, by producers, and proceeded to gain consumer acceptance. There then followed harmonisation and streamlining measures, clarifications and safeguards.\nWith regard to quality policy, there are only two areas within agriculture that are designated \u2018quality\u2019. These are the area under discussion today, and organic farming. Everything else is covered by the concept of food safety. Here, however, we are talking about and focusing on quality, in particular.\nAs the Commissioner has already mentioned, this is no trifling matter, it is a billion-euro business. Granting regions and businesses protection of geographical indications, designations of origin or specialities creates genuine added value. It is understandable that others will covet this added value.\nThe dispute is with the United States, in particular \u2013 and when I say United States, I mean the large multinationals. These are looking very carefully at whether the products now being protected here as designations of origin can perhaps be incorporated into their empires as trademarks. In exactly the same way as Coca-Cola, they want to include Feta cheese, Parmesan, Spreew\u00e4lder Gurken (Spreewald Gherkins), Karlsbader Oblaten (Karlsbad Wafers), Th\u00fcringer Rostbratwurst, and also Tiroler Speck \u2013 from both Austria and South Tyrol (S\u00fcdtiroler Speck) \u2013 with their trademarks; not because they consider them particularly good, but because there is money to be made from them. That is why they, too, have joined the discussion in the WTO, and now we are presenting our response.\nThe good thing about the discussion is that the WTO has said from the outset, as a matter of principle, that our rules are in accordance with its own rules. What is not in accordance with its rules, and where improvements need to be made, is the issue of third country access to these protected quality indications. We are making good this shortcoming, and I also think that this makes sense.\nI should also like to point out, however, that another kind of desire also comes to the fore here. For example, producers of Parma ham or Tiroler Speck may think to themselves: if we were to buy the pigs on the wider market, it would be cheaper than having to produce them in the region or stipulating that the regions from which we obtain them be specifically geared towards such production \u2013 because this would naturally mean an increase in production costs.\nIf we do not do that, however, we run the risk, in the international discussions within the WTO \u2013 and the multinationals will keep on and on at us about it \u2013 of lapsing into arbitrariness, of undermining our own quality indications and thus ultimately losing the protection. This being the case, it would be a highly dubious business to believe it is possible to buy raw materials at cheaper prices, and that is why we have stipulated and are stipulating that there be a special relationship between the regions in this regard.\nBy way of conclusion, I should like to say a few words of a procedural nature. As the Commissioner is also aware, the Council has already made a decision. We are once again holding a discussion here despite the fact that everything has already been decided, and that is unacceptable. The matter has to be debated first. I hope that we can also make that clear in the Constitution once it has been ratified.\nWe considered referring this matter back to committee out of pure annoyance, because, once again, we have been overlooked and our expert work is being ignored. However, we believe that this would project an outward lack of unity on our part in the WTO proceedings, and enable others to say: aha, they are not even agreed among themselves. Since we are in favour of strengthening and securing the EU position, we shall let it pass, but we should like to make clear where the Council\u2019s weaknesses lie in some regards, and would ask Commissioner Kroes to communicate that in her role as Commissioner, so that she reconsiders her decisions.\n(Applause)", "reconstructed_position": "<think>\nOkay, let's see.

The summary mentions him in the \"Parliamentary Response and Support\" section. It says he strongly supported the legislation and emphasized its broader significance beyond WTO compliance. He called geographical indications one of the two true quality designations in European agriculture, along with organic farming. He also mentioned that these protections are \"intellectual property [that] is the last raw material remaining to Europeans.\" \n\nThen, he raised concerns about US multinationals trying to appropriate European designations as trademarks. The quote is: \"These are looking very carefully at whether the products now being protected here as designations of origin can perhaps be incorporated into their empires as trademarks.\"\n\nAdditionally, there's a mention of a joint amendment by Graefe zu Baringdorf and Lulling about five-year trademark protection. But the user specified to only include points attributed to the speaker in question, which is Graefe zu Baringdorf. So the amendment part might be relevant if he proposed it. The summary says \"A joint amendment by Graefe zu Baringdorf and Lulling...\" so that's his contribution.\n\nSo the main points would be:\n1. Support for the legislation beyond WTO compliance, highlighting the significance of geographical indications as quality designations.\n2. Emphasis on geographical indications as intellectual property crucial for Europe.\n3. Concerns about US companies trying to take over protected designations as trademarks.\n4. Involvement in the joint amendment for five-year trademark protection.\n\nI need to make sure not to include other speakers' points. For example, the part about the PPE-DE group or others isn't relevant here. Also, check if there are other mentions. The conclusion part mentions him again in the context of amendments.

We are working on that, and I believe that the work that has been done in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development supports this position.\nThe first challenge facing us is to strengthen our system of consumers and producers even further. We need a faster system, with clearly defined time periods and procedures, in which competences are properly allocated. I believe that the way the sector itself perceives it is as important as the way the consumers perceive it, and it must be shown the economic advantages of a high-quality market: the security of a system of denomination which properly controls the products that do not comply with the conditions set, and a quick and not too burdensome procedure.\nI believe that the issue that we are dealing with is very important, particularly for countries such as my own, which are pioneers of ecological agriculture.

Let me start by reading through the debate summary again to make sure I don't miss anything.\n\nThe summary mentions that there were 22 speakers, and the debate was about two Council regulation proposals regarding agricultural products and foodstuffs, specifically traditional specialities and geographical indications protection. The Commission's position was about WTO compliance, and there were various parliamentary responses, cross-party support, concerns, criticisms, key amendments, and broader implications.\n\nNow, looking at the sections of the summary, the user specified that I should only include the points attributed to the speaker in question, which is Jan Tadeusz Masiel (NI). The challenge here is that the summary provided doesn't mention Jan Tadeusz Masiel at all.

Then in \"Concerns and Criticisms,\" the speakers are Daniel Stro\u017e, Witold Tomczak, Andrzej Tomczak Zapa\u0142owski. In \"Key Policy Proposals and Amendments,\" the speakers mentioned are Graefe zu Baringdorf, Lulling, Giusto Catania. In \"Broader Agricultural Policy Implications,\" the speakers are Mairead McGuinness, Robert Navarro, Agnes Schierhuber. The Commission's response is by Kroes.\n\nNowhere in the summary is there a mention of Jan Tadeusz Masiel (NI). The user's instruction says that if there are no points attributed to the speaker, I should respond with an empty string. Since the name isn't mentioned in the summary provided, the correct response would be an empty string. However, I need to make sure that I didn't overlook any part of the summary. Let me do a quick search for \"Masiel\" or \"Jan Tadeusz Masiel\" in the text. \n\nLooking through the summary again, there's no mention of that name. The only names mentioned are the ones listed in each section.

Let me look through the summary provided.\n\nFirst, the user mentioned that the debate was about agricultural products and foodstuffs, specifically traditional specialities and geographical indications protection. The summary covers various speakers and their contributions. The task is to extract only the points made by James Hugh Allister, and if there are none, return an empty string.\n\nLooking through the sections of the executive summary, there's a part about \"Cross-Party Parliamentary Support\" and then \"Concerns and Criticisms,\" \"Key Policy Proposals and Amendments,\" \"Broader Agricultural Policy Implications,\" and \"Commission Response and Accepted Amendments.\" \n\nIn the \"Cross-Party Parliamentary Support\" section, the PPE-DE Group, PSE Group, ALDE Group, and UEN Group are mentioned. The UEN Group's representative is Janusz Wojciechowski, who said something about traditional regional products being the real future of Europe. But the user is asking about James Hugh Allister from the NI group. \n\nWait, the summary mentions \"UEN Group: Janusz Wojciechowski...\" but the speaker in question is James Hugh Allister, who is part of the NI (NI stands for Neutral or maybe another group? Wait, in the EU Parliament, NI is the group for Members who are not part of any other group, sometimes called \"Non-Inscrits\" but in the context of the UK, maybe it's the NI group. However, in the summary provided, under the \"Cross-Party Parliamentary Support\" section, the UEN Group is mentioned, but there's no mention of James Hugh Allister. \n\nLooking through all the sections again: the \"Concerns and Criticisms\" section mentions Daniel Stro\u017e (GUE/NGL), Witold Tomczak (IND/DEM), and Andrzej Tomczak Zapa\u0142owski. Then in \"Key Policy Proposals and Amendments,\" there's mention of Graefe zu Baringdorf, Lulling, and others. In \"Broader Agricultural Policy Implications,\" Mairead McGuinness, Robert Navarro, Agnes Schierhuber. \n\nWait, the user's query is about James Hugh Allister (NI). But in the provided summary, I don't see any mention of James Hugh Allister. The summary lists 22 speakers, but the names mentioned in the summary are: Kroes, Graefe zu Baringdorf, Castiglione, Lulling, Salinas Garc\u00eda, Mulder, Wojciechowski, Stro\u017e, Tomczak, Zapa\u0142owski, McGuinness, Navarro, Schierhuber, and others. But not James Hugh Allister. \n\nIs it possible that the summary doesn't include his contributions? The user's instruction says that if there are no points attributed to the speaker, respond with an empty string. So since the summary doesn't mention James Hugh Allister, the answer would be an empty string. \n\nBut maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The summary's \"Executive Summary\" sections don't list Allister. The \"Debate Information\" says there were 22 speakers, but the summary only quotes specific names. It's possible that Allister's contributions aren't included in the summary provided.

I wish to underline that clearer identification of Community symbols by means of colouring, identification of the origin and place of processing of products from third countries, and the fact that the Commission\u2019s decision was upheld, render the process more credible and will lead to cheaper prices and less bureaucracy.", "reconstructed_position": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what Luis Manuel Capoulas Santos from the PSE group said in the debate. Let me look through the summary provided.\n\nFirst, the user mentioned that the debate was about agricultural products and foodstuffs, specifically traditional specialities and geographical indications protection. The summary has sections like Commission Position, Parliamentary Response, Cross-Party Support, Concerns, etc.\n\nLooking at the \"Cross-Party Parliamentary Support\" section, under the PSE Group, it says Mar\u00eda Isabel Salinas Garc\u00eda emphasized that \"quality is European agriculture's great asset\" and advocated for simplified, faster procedures with international recognition through the WTO. Wait, but the speaker in question is Luis Manuel Capoulas Santos, not Salinas Garc\u00eda. So maybe his contributions are in another part?\n\nWait, the user's query is about Luis Manuel Capoulas Santos (PSE). Let me check the entire summary again for his name. Scanning through the sections:\n\nIn the \"Executive Summary\" under \"Parliamentary Response and Support,\" there's a mention of Rapporteur Friedrich-Wilhelm Graefe zu Baringdorf, and then in the \"Cross-Party Parliamentary Support\" section, the PSE Group is mentioned with Mar\u00eda Isabel Salinas Garc\u00eda. Then in the \"Concerns and Criticisms\" section, there's Daniel Stro\u017e (GUE/NGL), Witold Tomczak (IND/DEM), Andrzej Tomczak Zapa\u0142owski. \n\nIn the \"Key Policy Proposals and Amendments\" section, there's mention of Graefe zu Baringdorf and Lulling's amendment. Then in \"Broader Agricultural Policy Implications,\" Mairead McGuinness, Robert Navarro, Agnes Schierhuber. \n\nWait, the user is asking about Luis Manuel Capoulas Santos (PSE). But in the provided summary, I don't see his name mentioned. The only PSE mention is Mar\u00eda Isabel Salinas Garc\u00eda. Maybe there's a typo or maybe he wasn't part of the debate? Or perhaps his contributions are not detailed here. \n\nThe user's instruction says if there are no points attributed to the speaker, respond with an empty string. So since the summary doesn't mention Luis Manuel Capoulas Santos, the answer would be empty. But I need to make sure I didn't miss any part. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through all sections again:\n\n- Debate Information: 22 speakers, but names not listed here except for some like Kroes, Graefe zu Baringdorf, Lulling, Salinas Garc\u00eda, etc.\n\n- In the \"Cross-Party Parliamentary Support\" section, under PSE: Mar\u00eda Isabel Salinas Garc\u00eda. No mention of Capoulas Santos.\n\n- In \"Concerns and Criticisms\": no Capoulas Santos.\n\n- In \"Key Policy Proposals and Amendments\": no.\n\n- \"Broader Agricultural Policy Implications\": no.\n\n- Commission Response: no.\n\nSo it seems that Luis Manuel Capoulas Santos isn't mentioned in the provided debate summary.

Mr\u00a0Mulder, I was also pleased with your contribution. We agree with each other in substance, but I am also pleased that you have praised my commitment. Of course, we are both now getting on a bit and have been in this business a long time; yet we are still concerned with things, we have not tired of fighting for what we think is right. When you complain that there are only two types of quality indication, I share your criticism. This must be extended; we must not only afford safety in the sense that people will not die from eating something, but also respect pleasure in eating, as well as quality, origin and the endeavours of generations.\nThis combination of free-market economy and quality assurance is exactly what we need. Market orientation is a good thing, of course, but it needs to be combined with an appreciation of what is being achieved here. In reply to the question a little while ago as to whether this is a purely administrative matter, I can only say: no, it is not an administrative matter, it is a system developed over generations that is now being given legislative and administrative safeguards. That is rather different from having something imposed on us.\nIf there were no benefit to be gained from this, we would not be having this discussion within the WTO. It is natural that the multinationals are keeping a watchful eye on the added value being created here \u2013 and that is considerable. Among us, Ireland \u2013 of which I have now twice heard mention \u2013 has unfortunately yet to set a good example, and I would urge it to encourage those of its regions manufacturing products in this way to submit a request. There must be no omissions in this regard. This is one aspect of the information that we, Parliament included, are able to provide.\nI should also like to mention the cooperation with Mrs\u00a0Lulling. She may not be the eldest, but she is the longest-serving among us. Anyone who has worked with her knows that this is not always an easy task. This is not only to do with political orientation, but also with Mrs\u00a0Lulling as a person. Nevertheless, we have managed to table joint amendments in some fields. I should like to mention some of the particularly important of those here.\nFor some obscure reason, the Council has introduced a provision that any natural or legal person having a legitimate interest can have a registration of a designation of origin or of a special quality indication cancelled. Indeed, since we are talking about added value here, the desire to transform this into trademarks will naturally arise. To show that we are not carrying out a commercial activity here, we have tabled a joint amendment. I would ask the Commission to really ensure that the Council incorporates this.\nIf a protected designation is cancelled, it cannot be transformed into a trademark for a period of five years. This gives us some leeway, and makes it that little bit more expensive for those who wish to transform designations into trademarks and are offering the people or the regions something in return. We must proceed very carefully in such situations. I hope that the Commissioner will take this further. I should like to express my sincere thanks for such a constructive discussion here today.", "lang": "DE", "original": "Friedrich-Wilhelm Graefe zu Baringdorf (Verts/ALE). \u2013 Herr Pr\u00e4sident! Ich bedanke mich bei den Kolleginnen und Kollegen und gebe von diesem vielen Lob gerne etwas an meine Mitarbeiter weiter. Herr Mulder, ich habe mich auch \u00fcber Ihren Beitrag gefreut. Einmal gehen wir inhaltlich konform, aber es freut mich auch, dass Sie mein Engagement loben. Wir sind ja inzwischen beide ziemlich alte Knochen und lange hier im Gesch\u00e4ft und trotzdem geht es uns noch an. Wir sind nicht m\u00fcde geworden, f\u00fcr das zu streiten, was wir f\u00fcr richtig halten. Wenn Sie beanstanden, dass es nur zwei Qualit\u00e4tsbezeichnungen gibt, so bem\u00e4ngle ich das genau wie Sie. Das m\u00fcssen wir ausweiten. Wir m\u00fcssen nicht nur Sicherheit in dem Sinne geben, das jemand nicht umf\u00e4llt, wenn er etwas isst, sondern auch den Genuss, die Qualit\u00e4t, den Ursprung und die Anstrengungen der Generationen w\u00fcrdigen.\nDiese Verbindung von freier Marktwirtschaft und Qualit\u00e4tssicherung ist genau das, was wir brauchen. Marktorientierung ja, aber bitte auch mit Anerkennung dessen, was hier geleistet wird. Wenn vorhin gefragt wurde, ob das nicht nur eine administrative Angelegenheit sei, muss ich darauf antworten: Nein, es ist keine administrative Angelegenheit, sondern es ist \u00fcber Generationen geschaffen und wird jetzt legislativ und administrativ abgesichert. Das ist etwas anderes, als wenn uns etwas aufoktroyiert w\u00fcrde.\nWenn hier kein Nutzen vorhanden w\u00e4re, h\u00e4tten wir in der WTO auch keine Auseinandersetzung. Nat\u00fcrlich schauen die Multis mit Argusaugen auf das, was hier an Mehrwert geschaffen wird, und das ist erheblich. Beispiel Irland, von dem ich jetzt zweimal geh\u00f6rt habe \u2013 leider bei uns noch nicht: Ja, unterst\u00fctzen Sie doch diejenigen Regionen in Ihrem Land, die Produkte in dieser Weise herstellen, dass sie dies einreichen. Hier darf kein Vers\u00e4umnis stattfinden. Das ist ein Teil der Aufkl\u00e4rung, die wir auch vom Europ\u00e4ischen Parlament aus leisten k\u00f6nnen.\nIch komme auch noch auf die Zusammenarbeit mit Frau Lulling zu sprechen. Zwar nicht an Alter, aber an Dienstzeit \u00fcbertrifft sie uns alle. Wer mit ihr gearbeitet hat, wei\u00df, dass das nicht immer ganz einfach ist.

Mr\u00a0Mulder, I was also pleased with your contribution. We agree with each other in substance, but I am also pleased that you have praised my commitment. Of course, we are both now getting on a bit and have been in this business a long time; yet we are still concerned with things, we have not tired of fighting for what we think is right. When you complain that there are only two types of quality indication, I share your criticism. This must be extended; we must not only afford safety in the sense that people will not die from eating something, but also respect pleasure in eating, as well as quality, origin and the endeavours of generations.\nThis combination of free-market economy and quality assurance is exactly what we need. Market orientation is a good thing, of course, but it needs to be combined with an appreciation of what is being achieved here. In reply to the question a little while ago as to whether this is a purely administrative matter, I can only say: no, it is not an administrative matter, it is a system developed over generations that is now being given legislative and administrative safeguards. That is rather different from having something imposed on us.\nIf there were no benefit to be gained from this, we would not be having this discussion within the WTO. It is natural that the multinationals are keeping a watchful eye on the added value being created here \u2013 and that is considerable. Among us, Ireland \u2013 of which I have now twice heard mention \u2013 has unfortunately yet to set a good example, and I would urge it to encourage those of its regions manufacturing products in this way to submit a request. There must be no omissions in this regard. This is one aspect of the information that we, Parliament included, are able to provide.\nI should also like to mention the cooperation with Mrs\u00a0Lulling. She may not be the eldest, but she is the longest-serving among us. Anyone who has worked with her knows that this is not always an easy task. This is not only to do with political orientation, but also with Mrs\u00a0Lulling as a person. Nevertheless, we have managed to table joint amendments in some fields. I should like to mention some of the particularly important of those here.\nFor some obscure reason, the Council has introduced a provision that any natural or legal person having a legitimate interest can have a registration of a designation of origin or of a special quality indication cancelled. Indeed, since we are talking about added value here, the desire to transform this into trademarks will naturally arise. To show that we are not carrying out a commercial activity here, we have tabled a joint amendment. I would ask the Commission to really ensure that the Council incorporates this.\nIf a protected designation is cancelled, it cannot be transformed into a trademark for a period of five years. This gives us some leeway, and makes it that little bit more expensive for those who wish to transform designations into trademarks and are offering the people or the regions something in return. We must proceed very carefully in such situations. I hope that the Commissioner will take this further. I should like to express my sincere thanks for such a constructive discussion here today.", "reconstructed_position": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out the main points or arguments made by Friedrich-Wilhelm Graefe zu Baringdorf in the debate. Let me start by reading through the provided debate summary carefully.\n\nThe user mentioned that the response should only include the points attributed to the specified speaker, so I need to focus on the sections where Graefe zu Baringdorf is mentioned. \n\nLooking at the summary, under the \"Parliamentary Response and Support\" section, it says that Rapporteur Friedrich-Wilhelm Graefe zu Baringdorf (Verts/ALE) strongly supported the legislation while emphasizing its broader significance beyond WTO compliance. He called geographical indications as one of the two true quality designations in European agriculture, along with organic farming. He argued these protections represent \"intellectual property [that] is the last raw material remaining to Europeans.\" \n\nThen, he raised concerns about US multinationals trying to appropriate protected European designations as trademarks. The quote is: \"These are looking very carefully at whether the products now being protected here as designations of origin can perhaps be incorporated into their empires as trademarks.\"\n\nAlso, under \"Key Policy Proposals and Amendments,\" there's a mention of a joint amendment by Graefe zu Baringdorf and Lulling proposing that cancelled protected designations cannot be registered as trademarks for five years. \n\nSo, the main points from Graefe zu Baringdorf are:\n1. Support for the legislation but emphasizing its broader significance beyond WTO compliance.\n2. Positioning geographical indications as a key quality designation alongside organic farming.\n3. Highlighting the importance of intellectual property as a remaining resource for Europeans.\n4. Concerns about US companies trying to take over European designations as trademarks.\n5. Advocating for a five-year protection period against trademark registration of cancelled designations.\n\nI need to make sure not to include other speakers' points. For example, the part about the five-year amendment is attributed to him and Lulling, so that's included. Other parts like the cross-party support or other criticisms are from different speakers and should be excluded. \n\nDouble-checking the summary to ensure there's no other mention of him. The conclusion and other sections don't attribute anything else to him. So the response should list these points concisely.\n</think>\n\nFriedrich-Wilhelm Graefe zu Baringdorf (Verts/ALE) argued that geographical indications are one of only two true quality designations in European agriculture (alongside organic farming), framing them as \"intellectual property [that] is the last raw material remaining to Europeans.\" He expressed concern about US multinationals seeking to appropriate protected European designations as trademarks, warning that these entities \"are looking very carefully at whether the products now being protected here as designations of origin can perhaps be incorporated into their empires as trademarks.\" Additionally, he co-proposed an amendment ensuring that cancelled protected designations cannot be registered as trademarks for five years to prevent commercial exploitation.", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Neelie Kroes,", "english": "Neelie Kroes, Member of the Commission .

That was a point mentioned by Mr\u00a0Allister and, in my opinion, it addresses his concerns.\nIn response to Mr Mulder, I reiterate the intention of the Commission to further review the various policy issues not related to the WTO findings and the wider issue of the agricultural quality policy in the EC over the next year.

I also want to make it clear that any advantage given to EC producers \u2013 and I believe the use of a Community symbol is such an advantage \u2013 will be equally open to third country producers. That answer is for Mr Castiglione and Mrs Herranz Garc\u00eda. However, the Commission agrees that this needs to be further explored. This will be done within the framework of the wider policy review, which the Commission intends to conduct as soon as this proposal has been implemented.\nSeveral amendments deal with the obligations of the Member States and the Commission, which Mr Podka\u0144ski mentioned. The Commission has no intention of altering the current distribution of competence between the Member States and the Commission.\nAmendments 23 and 24 ask for a time period for the Commission to scrutinise and publish applications. I agree that the Commission should carry out its duties within a reasonable period of time. Mrs Lulling and Mrs\u00a0Salinas Garc\u00eda touched upon that. I agree that we should take into account the definition of a reasonable period of time, which is not easy, given the complexity of applications. It is certainly not realistic to have all the applications scrutinised and published in six months; twelve months would be more acceptable.\nYour amendments on controls reflect the aim of the Commission proposal, which is to ensure that there is a clear understanding that all over the EC there are authorities in charge of enforcing the Community rules on geographical indications and traditional specialities. There is also no doubt that these controls will be carried out within the framework of Regulation (EC) No\u00a0882/2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law.\nThere are points that concern only the geographical indications report that I want to mention. These are the use of ingredients in processed products and the origin of raw materials. I confirm that your proposals concerning the use of protected names in relation to ingredients for processed products meet some of the Commission\u2019s concerns. However, the general rules on labelling already cover cases of misleading information. Further restrictions on the use of registered names for processed products would mean a major policy change that deserves to be adequately and thoroughly assessed.\nI took note of various amendments concerning the labelling of origin or other conditions applicable to raw materials. The Commission shares Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf\u2019s objective that people should not be misled in this respect. However, we have to be very prudent. Any policy change in this field may affect rights already granted to users of certain designations.\nFinally, I shall make a few points on the TSG report. The current regulation on traditional specialities guaranteed has no definition for the term \u2018traditional\u2019. We propose to introduce the obligation to prove usage for a time period of at least 25 years.

The user provided a detailed summary, and I need to focus only on what the speaker, Neelie Kroes, said.\n\nLooking at the \"Commission Position and Context\" section, it says that Commissioner Neelie Kroes opened the debate. She explained the primary driver for the proposals: compliance with WTO panel conclusions after challenges by the US and Australia. She mentioned that over 700 GIs have been registered since 1993 with commercial value over \u20ac10 billion. She also noted that if they just conform to WTO rules without increasing efficiency, the approval process might stall. The Commission's approach was limited to WTO compliance, not broader policy reforms, which would be addressed later.\n\nSo, the key points from Kroes would be:\n1. The main reason for the proposals is to comply with WTO rulings.\n2. Mention of the existing 700 GIs and their economic value.\n3. Warning that without efficiency improvements, the system could stall.\n4. The Commission's limited scope, focusing on WTO compliance and deferring deeper changes for future reviews.\n\nI need to make sure I don't include anything from other speakers.
