In my opening statement I address both reports, thereby focusing on the general background that has led to these Commission proposals.\nFirstly, as regards the report on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin, almost 14 years ago the European Community established a voluntary system of geographical indications for agricultural products and foodstuffs other than wines and spirits. Since 1993, over 700 names have been registered. Almost 300 requests are currently waiting for registration; this gives an idea of the success of this system.\nThis success may explain the interest shown by our trade partners in this regulation. The conclusions of the recent WTO panels on cases brought by the US and Australia impose on us the obligation to open the Community scheme to direct applications and objections from individuals in third countries.\nThis is the fundamental reason for the proposal you have on the table: to ensure conformity with the conclusions of the panels. On the basis of experience gained in managing the registration process, we realised that the current system would not survive an additional burden of direct applications from operators in third countries. Thus we had to streamline the system and make it more efficient.\nIf we simply conform to WTO rules without increasing the efficiency of the functioning of the system, the whole approval process could come to a standstill. I should add that, in order to avoid any risk of a new complaint at WTO level, the procedure for third-country and EU denominations should be as similar as possible.\nWe have all been surprised by the extent of the changes required under the WTO ruling. While the Community won the panel on the substantive trademark issue, we lost on the procedural questions. We also included one clear policy change, namely promoting the use of Community logos for enhancing the credibility of the system.

In spite of the modest number of products registered, some producers have shown their interest in this regulation. There are only 50 names registered as traditional specialities guaranteed, but there are 19 applications pending at Community level and a number of others under examination in the Member States. This regulation has not been amended since its adoption in 1992. The procedures have been designed neither for 25 nor for 27 Member States, or for handling a significant number of applications.\nThere is a similar need to streamline and standardise the content of applications so that more efficient procedures are adopted and so that producers who make the effort to engage in quality schemes are not disappointed by approvals being delayed for several years.\nI also consider it important to correct a number of inconsistencies and to reflect substantial advances in legal drafting standards since 1992. At the same time, we propose simplifications and clarifications and other improvements identical to those proposed for geographical indications and designations of origin.\nFinally, we are keen to make it clear in this regulation that WTO rules are respected and to forestall any criticism.\nIn conclusion, these proposals achieve WTO conformity and introduce limited but necessary housekeeping that is designed to streamline and clarify procedures.

Let me start by reading through the provided information carefully.\n\nThe debate is about agricultural products and foodstuffs as traditional specialities, focusing on geographical indications and designations of origin. The speaker in question is Neelie Kroes, the Commission representative. \n\nLooking at the \"Commission Position\" section, it says that Commissioner Neelie Kroes outlined the proposals' aim to achieve WTO compliance after panel conclusions from the US and Australia. She mentioned that over 700 GIs have been registered since 1993, worth a \u20ac10+ billion market. Her key points are about streamlining procedures, promoting Community logos, and ensuring equal treatment for third-country applications while meeting the April 20, 2006 WTO deadline.\n\nI need to make sure I only include her arguments and not others. The user specified that contributions from other speakers shouldn't be included. So, the main points here are:\n\n1. The proposals are to comply with WTO rules following US and Australia's panel decisions.\n2. Highlighting the existing GIs (over 700 since 1993) and their market value (\u20ac10+ billion).\n3. The need to streamline procedures to avoid the approval process stalling.\n4. Promoting Community logos.\n5. Equal treatment for third-country applications.\n6. Adhering to the WTO deadline of April 20, 2006.\n\nI should check if there are any other mentions of her arguments. The summary mentions her quote: \"If we simply conform to WTO rules without increasing the efficiency of the functioning of the system, the whole approval process could come to a standstill.\" That's part of her argument about streamlining procedures.\n\nNo other speakers' points are attributed to her. So the answer should list these points concisely.\n</think>\n\nThe Commission's position, as outlined by Neelie Kroes, focused on three key arguments:  \n1. **WTO Compliance**: The proposals aimed to align with WTO rules following disputes with the United States and Australia, emphasizing the need to avoid procedural stagnation by improving system efficiency.  \n2. **Market Value of GIs**: Over 700 geographical indications (GIs) had been registered since 1993, representing a \u20ac10+ billion market, underscoring their economic significance.  \n3. **Procedural Reforms**: The Commission proposed streamlining application processes, promoting a \"Community logo\" for recognition, and ensuring equal treatment for third-country applications while adhering to the April 20, 2006 WTO deadline.", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Friedrich-Wilhelm Graefe zu Baringdorf (Verts/ALE),", "english": "Friedrich-Wilhelm Graefe zu Baringdorf (Verts/ALE), rapporteur. \u2013 (DE) Mr\u00a0President, I am glad that the Commissioner is here to represent the Commission at today\u2019s debate on this report. Her colleague, Commissioner Fischer\u00a0Boel, cannot be present, but that should not prevent us from making this a good discussion.\nThe Commissioner said that this is not the beginning of a legislative process, but that we are just responding to a request from the WTO. The beginnings of a legislative framework for quality assurance came in\u00a01992, as much as 14\u00a0years ago, but, of course, that was not the start of high-quality production in the areas that were protected at that time. It was rather the case that, as with organic farming, the matter of the products at issue here had been introduced onto the market long ago, over a period of decades, by producers, and proceeded to gain consumer acceptance. There then followed harmonisation and streamlining measures, clarifications and safeguards.\nWith regard to quality policy, there are only two areas within agriculture that are designated \u2018quality\u2019. These are the area under discussion today, and organic farming. Everything else is covered by the concept of food safety. Here, however, we are talking about and focusing on quality, in particular.\nAs the Commissioner has already mentioned, this is no trifling matter, it is a billion-euro business. Granting regions and businesses protection of geographical indications, designations of origin or specialities creates genuine added value. It is understandable that others will covet this added value.\nThe dispute is with the United States, in particular \u2013 and when I say United States, I mean the large multinationals. These are looking very carefully at whether the products now being protected here as designations of origin can perhaps be incorporated into their empires as trademarks. In exactly the same way as Coca-Cola, they want to include Feta cheese, Parmesan, Spreew\u00e4lder Gurken (Spreewald Gherkins), Karlsbader Oblaten (Karlsbad Wafers), Th\u00fcringer Rostbratwurst, and also Tiroler Speck \u2013 from both Austria and South Tyrol (S\u00fcdtiroler Speck) \u2013 with their trademarks; not because they consider them particularly good, but because there is money to be made from them. That is why they, too, have joined the discussion in the WTO, and now we are presenting our response.\nThe good thing about the discussion is that the WTO has said from the outset, as a matter of principle, that our rules are in accordance with its own rules. What is not in accordance with its rules, and where improvements need to be made, is the issue of third country access to these protected quality indications. We are making good this shortcoming, and I also think that this makes sense.\nI should also like to point out, however, that another kind of desire also comes to the fore here. For example, producers of Parma ham or Tiroler Speck may think to themselves: if we were to buy the pigs on the wider market, it would be cheaper than having to produce them in the region or stipulating that the regions from which we obtain them be specifically geared towards such production \u2013 because this would naturally mean an increase in production costs.\nIf we do not do that, however, we run the risk, in the international discussions within the WTO \u2013 and the multinationals will keep on and on at us about it \u2013 of lapsing into arbitrariness, of undermining our own quality indications and thus ultimately losing the protection. This being the case, it would be a highly dubious business to believe it is possible to buy raw materials at cheaper prices, and that is why we have stipulated and are stipulating that there be a special relationship between the regions in this regard.\nBy way of conclusion, I should like to say a few words of a procedural nature. As the Commissioner is also aware, the Council has already made a decision. We are once again holding a discussion here despite the fact that everything has already been decided, and that is unacceptable. The matter has to be debated first. I hope that we can also make that clear in the Constitution once it has been ratified.\nWe considered referring this matter back to committee out of pure annoyance, because, once again, we have been overlooked and our expert work is being ignored. However, we believe that this would project an outward lack of unity on our part in the WTO proceedings, and enable others to say: aha, they are not even agreed among themselves. Since we are in favour of strengthening and securing the EU position, we shall let it pass, but we should like to make clear where the Council\u2019s weaknesses lie in some regards, and would ask Commissioner Kroes to communicate that in her role as Commissioner, so that she reconsiders her decisions.\n(Applause)", "lang": "DE", "original": "Friedrich-Wilhelm Graefe zu Baringdorf (Verts/ALE), Berichterstatter . \u2013 Herr Pr\u00e4sident! Frau Kommissarin, ich freue mich, dass Sie heute bei der Aussprache \u00fcber diesen Bericht die Kommission vertreten. Ihre Kollegin, Frau Fischer Boel, kann nicht anwesend sein. Das soll uns aber nicht daran hindern, zu einer guten Diskussion zu kommen.\nSie haben davon gesprochen, dass dies nicht der Beginn einer legislativen Auseinandersetzung ist, sondern dass wir auf eine Anforderung der WTO reagieren. Bereits vor 14 Jahren, 1992, ist diese legislative Qualit\u00e4tssicherung auf den Weg gebracht worden. Aber nat\u00fcrlich war das, Frau Kommissarin, nicht der Beginn der Qualit\u00e4tserzeugung in den Bereichen, die dann gesch\u00fctzt wurden, sondern die Frage der Produkte, die hier zur Debatte stehen, ist \u00e4hnlich wie beim biologischen Landbau l\u00e4ngst und \u00fcber Jahrzehnte von den Erzeugern auf den Markt gebracht und von den Verbrauchern und Verbraucherinnen aufgenommen worden. Dann ist harmonisiert worden, es ist gestrafft worden, es hat eine Kl\u00e4rung und eine Absicherung gegeben.\nWir haben, wenn es um Qualit\u00e4tspolitik geht, in der Agrarwirtschaft nur zwei Bereiche, die sich als Qualit\u00e4t ausweisen. Das sind ebendieser Bereich, den wir heute besprechen, und der biologische Landbau. Alles andere f\u00e4llt unter den Begriff Lebensmittelsicherheit. Hier aber dr\u00fccken wir ausdr\u00fccklich die Qualit\u00e4t aus und setzen darauf den Fokus.\nSie haben schon erw\u00e4hnt, das ist keine Lappalie, sondern ein Milliardengesch\u00e4ft. Hier kann in den Regionen und in den Betrieben durch einen Schutz, der ihnen f\u00fcr diese geografischen oder Ursprungsbezeichnungen oder Spezialit\u00e4ten gew\u00e4hrt wird, ein echter Mehrwert geschaffen werden. Dass diese h\u00f6here Wertsch\u00f6pfung, die sich daraus ergibt, aber auch Begehrlichkeiten weckt, ist verst\u00e4ndlich.\nWir haben zum einen die Auseinandersetzung insbesondere mit den USA \u2013 und wenn ich USA sage, meine ich die gro\u00dfen Multis\u00a0\u2013, die sehr aufmerksam darauf schauen, ob sie das, was hier jetzt als Ursprungsbezeichnungen gesch\u00fctzt wird, nicht als Marken in ihr Imperium \u00fcbernehmen k\u00f6nnen. Genau wie Coca Cola m\u00f6chten sie Feta-K\u00e4se, Parmesan, Spreewaldgurken, Karlsbader Oblaten, Th\u00fcringer Rostbratwurst, aber auch den Tiroler Speck \u2013 sowohl den \u00f6sterreichischen als auch den S\u00fcdtiroler Speck \u2013 in ihre Marken aufnehmen, nicht, weil sie das besonders sch\u00f6n finden, sondern weil daran zu verdienen ist.

Let me start by reading through the summary again to locate his contributions.\n\nLooking at the \"Rapporteur's Perspective\" section, it mentions that he positioned the debate as defending European quality against multinational corporations. He said, \"Intellectual property is the last raw material remaining to Europeans.\" So that's one point: defending European quality against multinationals and highlighting intellectual property as a key asset.\n\nHe also criticized procedural issues where the Council made a decision before the parliamentary debate, calling it \"unacceptable.\" That's another point about procedural concerns and the timing of decisions.\n\nThe user specified to only include arguments attributed to the speaker, so I need to make sure not to include other speakers' points.

So that's a third point: specific examples of multinationals trying to take over protected names.\n\nSo compiling these, the main points are:\n1. Defending European quality against multinational corporations.\n2. Intellectual property as a critical resource for Europeans.\n3. Criticism of the Council's premature decision-making.\n4. Concerns about multinationals appropriating protected designations for profit.\n\nI need to present these clearly, ensuring each point is directly from his contributions.

Given that two phases of analysis of the question had been foreseen, one on a national and one on a Community level, it was absolutely necessary to make sure they were coordinated.\nI am convinced that the greater responsibilities given by the Member States, the precise terms articulating the procedure and the new system of oppositions, address the need for faster and more efficient recognition, that is to say for a quick check that is also endowed with the crucial characteristic of completeness.\nThe opportunity for third countries to access the European system for the protection of agricultural products makes it necessary to protect the consumer from a false association between Community symbols and the actual origin of a product. The indication of the origin of a product on a label, along with the diversification of the colour of Community logos and the authorisation of the use of expressions for processed products, are all innovations that address the need for greater protection of consumers. Furthermore, I believe that these measures will encourage producers to take greater and fuller advantage of the labelling of excellent products by following the approach to food quality that the European Union promotes.\nLastly, I support Amendments 48 and 50, which are aimed at allowing the involvement of regional authorities in the national checking phase and greater protection of the protected designation of origin (PDO) and the protected geographical indication (PGI) with respect to other forms of protection like trademarks. I hope that my fellow Members will share this point of view by approving these two amendments tomorrow.\nFinally, I wish to thank the Commission, which has put this before Parliament, in which regard I also pick up what my fellow Member said earlier, for these procedures and for their recognition of the production of quality products.

Let me start by reading through the summary again to make sure I don't miss anything.\n\nThe debate is about agricultural products and foodstuffs as traditional specialties, focusing on geographical indications and designations of origin. The user mentioned that the response should only include arguments from the specified speaker, Giuseppe Castiglione, and not others. \n\nLooking at the \"Party Group Positions\" section, there's a part about the PPE-DE Group. It says that Giuseppe Castiglione and other PPE-DE speakers strongly supported the Commission's work while advocating for amendments. The key points here are supporting the Commission's efforts but pushing for specific changes. The summary mentions they wanted regional authority involvement and stronger PDO/PGI protection against trademarks. Also, Astrid Lulling emphasized the urgency of the April 20 WTO deadline. However, the user is asking about Giuseppe Castiglione, not Lulling. \n\nThe summary states that the PPE-DE group pushed for specific deadlines: six months for Commission examination and four months for objections. They also wanted to prevent cancelled designations from becoming trademarks for five years. But I need to check if Castiglione is the one who mentioned these points or if it's the group as a whole. The text says \"PPE-DE speakers\" including Castiglione, so it's possible that these points are part of the group's position, but the user wants only the speaker's own arguments. However, the summary might not attribute each specific point to individual speakers, just the group. \n\nThe challenge here is that the summary might not have detailed individual contributions beyond the rapporteur and some other named speakers. The user's instruction is to only include points attributed to the speaker. If the summary doesn't specify which exact points Castiglione made, but just says the PPE-DE group supported the Commission's work and advocated for amendments, then I need to check if there's any direct quote or specific argument from Castiglione. \n\nLooking through the summary again, under the PPE-DE Group section, it says \"Giuseppe Castiglione and other PPE-DE speakers strongly supported the Commission's work while advocating for amendments ensuring regional authority involvement and stronger PDO/PGI protection against trademarks.\" So the key points here are supporting the Commission's work, advocating for amendments, regional authority involvement, and stronger protection against trademarks. \n\nAre there any other points? The summary also mentions that the group pushed for specific deadlines (six months for Commission examination, four months for objections) and preventing cancelled designations from becoming trademarks for five years. But the text says \"the group pushed for...\" so it's not clear if Castiglione specifically mentioned those deadlines. However, since the user is asking about Giuseppe Castiglione, and the summary groups him with other PPE-DE speakers, perhaps those points are part of his arguments as a member of the group. But the instructions say to only include arguments attributed to the speaker. If the summary doesn't explicitly attribute those specific amendments to Castiglione, maybe I should only include the general support for the Commission's work and the amendments regarding regional authority and protection against trademarks. \n\nSo the main points would be:\n1. Supported the Commission's work.\n2. Advocated for amendments to ensure regional authority involvement.\n3. Pushed for stronger protection of PDO/PGI against trademarks.\n\nI need to make sure there's no other information. The summary doesn't have any other mentions of Castiglione. The user's answer should be a list of these points. If there's no specific information, the answer is empty, but in this case, there are points attributed to him as part of the PPE-DE group's position.\n</think>\n\nGiuseppe Castiglione, as part of the PPE-DE Group, strongly supported the Commission's work on the proposals while advocating for amendments to ensure **regional authority involvement** in the protection of PDO/PGI (Protected Designation of Origin/Protected Geographical Indication) and **stronger safeguards against trademarks** undermining these designations.

I believe that the way the sector itself perceives it is as important as the way the consumers perceive it, and it must be shown the economic advantages of a high-quality market: the security of a system of denomination which properly controls the products that do not comply with the conditions set, and a quick and not too burdensome procedure.\nI believe that the issue that we are dealing with is very important, particularly for countries such as my own, which are pioneers of ecological agriculture. As I have said, I believe that this issue deserves more in-depth consideration, and we must do this once the requirements of the WTO \u2013 and this must happen as soon as possible \u2013 have been complied with, simplifying access to the system for third-country products.\nDuring the subsequent examination and reflection that we will hold in this House, I believe that it is essential to listen to the sector and to be attentive to its needs, thinking at all times of directing our products and our quality towards the global market, these being the values of a truly competitive European agri-food sector.", "lang": "ES", "original": "Mar\u00eda Isabel Salinas Garc\u00eda, en nombre del Grupo del PSE . \u2013 (ES) Se\u00f1or Presidente, como muy bien ha dicho nuestro ponente, creo que la calidad es el gran activo de la agricultura europea.\nAnte un mercado global en el que tenemos que competir, cada vez m\u00e1s, por \u00ednfimos costes de mano de obra, escasas exigencias medioambientales y de higiene, es decir, precios m\u00e1s bajos, creo que la calidad debe marcar la diferencia.

In the light of increasing liberalisation of trade in agricultural products, it is necessary for us to recognise more geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs at international level. His conclusions are completely justified therefore.\nWhat also comes into play for me is what precisely the definition of a geographical indication in Europe itself is.

The rapporteur was Friedrich-Wilhelm Graefe zu Baringdorf, and there are sections on the Commission's position, the rapporteur's perspective, party group positions, critical voices, and key amendments. However, when I look through the sections, I don't see any mention of a speaker named Daniel Stro\u017e. \n\nLet me check each part again. The Commission Position mentions Neelie Kroes.

The user provided a detailed summary, and I need to extract only the arguments made by Witold Tomczak. \n\nLooking at the \"Critical Voices and Concerns\" section, there's a part about Witold Tomczak (IND/DEM). The summary says he questioned the system's effectiveness, noting only 15 traditional specialties registered EU-wide despite complex procedures. His quote is, \"If we turn delicacies into mass products, they will no longer be delicacies.\" \n\nSo his main argument is about the system not being effective because only 15 specialties are registered, which is a low number. He's concerned that the current procedures are too complex, leading to few registrations. His second point is that turning these delicacies into mass-produced items would destroy their status as delicacies. \n\nI need to make sure there are no other mentions of Tomczak elsewhere.

We have to pay more for so-called \u2018organic\u2019 products in order to buy what should be normal food.\nIt is cynical to say that consumers today regard quality as more important than quantity.

Happily, consumers are increasingly appreciative of this and are prepared to pay reasonable prices, thereby helping to keep people in work up- and downstream and, in turn, contributing to rural development.\nIt has been well documented that the United States and Australia had the nerve to attack our successful regulation on the issue at the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Over 700 product designations have been registered since 1993, the commercial value of which is put at over EUR\u00a010\u00a0billion. I feel I should mention at this point the registration of Tiroler Speck , which Mr\u00a0Ebner, who has given me his two minutes of speaking time in this debate, holds especially dear.\nThe WTO\u2019s competent body has fortunately come to the conclusion that our regulation was not in breach of WTO rules. All we have to do is adapt it by 20\u00a0April \u2013 there is no time to waste, in other words \u2013 so as to place third country nationals on an equal footing with EU citizens as regards the application procedure and the right to object.\nI wish to congratulate our rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, and to commend him on the excellent spirit of collaboration, which is not always in evidence between factions across the political divide in Parliament. I welcome the fact that \u2013 with Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf and with other luminaries of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, including the chairman, Mr\u00a0Daul \u2013 we have succeeded in reaching agreement on amendments aimed at clarifying and simplifying matters and at making them more specific, as well as at ensuring respect, via adequate monitoring, for this intellectual property of our farmers, which is one of the last raw materials possessed by Europeans.\nWhat we especially want to do \u2013 by means of specific deadlines:\u00a0six months for the Commission to examine applications, four months to raise objections \u2013 is to avoid there being damaging delays for the operators involved. We want to see Community symbols, our logos, distinguished by specific colours and to ensure that these are not used by third countries. Lastly, we wish to ensure that if the registration of a PDO or PGI is cancelled, it cannot be registered as a trade mark for five years. This is to prevent any economic pressure being put on producers.\nI know that many Members of this Chamber have had many ideas and suggestions for improving the law, but we would call on the Council, as time is ticking away, to implement initially only the changes made necessary by the WTO\u2019s ruling.

The announcement was made today in Ireland. When we talk about the WTO, Ireland is their first casualty in terms of sugar beet production. Three hundred workers will lose their jobs and 3\u00a0500 farmers will be very badly affected. Is this the warning sign of what lies ahead, as the power of the WTO to shape our agriculture in Europe intensifies? If sugar beet is sacrificed today, as it has been in Ireland, what about EU beef farming tomorrow?\nWith regard to this report, I thank the rapporteur for his good work. However, I fear that we sometimes talk about this issue with great intensity \u2013 as we should \u2013 but ignore the bigger picture of commodity production in the European Union, which also needs protection.\nI regret that in Ireland we have only three products that are registered under the PGI\u00a0description, but we have many hundreds of small food companies that could take the protection offered by these regulations. I would urge them to do so. We will need more and more speciality products if we are to meet the challenges in terms of the reform of the CAP and the pressures of the WTO. We need to recognise that the continuation of food production in Europe depends on a commitment to the sector and a recognition that it cannot be expected to survive the onslaught of unlimited market access by low-cost commodities produced outside the Union at different and lower standards.\nBy all means let us protect and encourage those who want to produce speciality foods, but let us also recognise that EU agriculture produces high-specification commodities which are also in need of protection.", "reconstructed_position": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the main points or arguments made by Mairead McGuinness from the PPE-DE group in the given debate summary. Let me start by reading through the provided information carefully.\n\nFirst, the debate is about agricultural products and foodstuffs as traditional specialties, focusing on geographical indications and designations of origin. The speaker in question is Mairead McGuinness, part of the PPE-DE group. The user wants only the points attributed to her, nothing from others.\n\nLooking at the \"Critical Voices and Concerns\" section, there's a part about \"Broader Agricultural Concerns\" where several speakers linked the debate to wider CAP (Common Agricultural Policy) pressures. Then, under that, it mentions Mairead McGuinness specifically. The quote given is: \"When we talk about the WTO, Ireland is their first casualty\" [McGuinness, 2006-03-15]. \n\nSo her main argument here is about the impact of WTO on Ireland's agricultural sector, specifically the sugar industry closure. She's connecting the debate on geographical indications to broader CAP issues and WTO implications. She's warning about the negative effects of WTO agreements, using Ireland's experience as an example. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other mention of her in other sections. Scanning through the summary again, under \"Party Group Positions,\" the PPE-DE group is mentioned with Giuseppe Castiglione and Astrid Lulling, but not McGuinness. The \"Broader Agricultural Concerns\" section is the only place where she's cited. \n\nTherefore, the only point attributed to her is the warning about WTO impacts, using Ireland's sugar industry as a case study. There's no other argument or contribution from her in the summary provided. So the answer should reflect that single point.\n</think>\n\nMairead McGuinness (PPE-DE) highlighted the broader implications of WTO negotiations on European agriculture, citing Ireland's experience with the closure of its sugar industry as a cautionary example.

Let me check the \"Party Group Positions\" section for the PSE Group.\n\nLooking at the PSE Group's part: \"Mar\u00eda Isabel Salinas Garc\u00eda and other PSE members viewed quality as 'European agriculture's great asset' [Salinas Garc\u00eda, 2006-03-15].

There's no direct mention of Marc Tarabella in the provided summary. Let me double-check the entire debate summary again to see if there's any other reference to Marc Tarabella.\n\nLooking through the sections again: the \"Executive Summary\" sections mention various speakers like Kroes, Graefe zu Baringdorf, Castiglione, Lulling, Salinas Garc\u00eda, Mulder, Tomczak, Zapa\u0142owski, McGuinness, etc. But I don't see any mention of Marc Tarabella.

Mr\u00a0Mulder, I was also pleased with your contribution. We agree with each other in substance, but I am also pleased that you have praised my commitment. Of course, we are both now getting on a bit and have been in this business a long time; yet we are still concerned with things, we have not tired of fighting for what we think is right. When you complain that there are only two types of quality indication, I share your criticism. This must be extended; we must not only afford safety in the sense that people will not die from eating something, but also respect pleasure in eating, as well as quality, origin and the endeavours of generations.\nThis combination of free-market economy and quality assurance is exactly what we need. Market orientation is a good thing, of course, but it needs to be combined with an appreciation of what is being achieved here. In reply to the question a little while ago as to whether this is a purely administrative matter, I can only say: no, it is not an administrative matter, it is a system developed over generations that is now being given legislative and administrative safeguards. That is rather different from having something imposed on us.\nIf there were no benefit to be gained from this, we would not be having this discussion within the WTO. It is natural that the multinationals are keeping a watchful eye on the added value being created here \u2013 and that is considerable. Among us, Ireland \u2013 of which I have now twice heard mention \u2013 has unfortunately yet to set a good example, and I would urge it to encourage those of its regions manufacturing products in this way to submit a request. There must be no omissions in this regard. This is one aspect of the information that we, Parliament included, are able to provide.\nI should also like to mention the cooperation with Mrs\u00a0Lulling. She may not be the eldest, but she is the longest-serving among us. Anyone who has worked with her knows that this is not always an easy task. This is not only to do with political orientation, but also with Mrs\u00a0Lulling as a person. Nevertheless, we have managed to table joint amendments in some fields. I should like to mention some of the particularly important of those here.\nFor some obscure reason, the Council has introduced a provision that any natural or legal person having a legitimate interest can have a registration of a designation of origin or of a special quality indication cancelled. Indeed, since we are talking about added value here, the desire to transform this into trademarks will naturally arise. To show that we are not carrying out a commercial activity here, we have tabled a joint amendment. I would ask the Commission to really ensure that the Council incorporates this.\nIf a protected designation is cancelled, it cannot be transformed into a trademark for a period of five years. This gives us some leeway, and makes it that little bit more expensive for those who wish to transform designations into trademarks and are offering the people or the regions something in return. We must proceed very carefully in such situations. I hope that the Commissioner will take this further.

He used the quote: \"Intellectual property is the last raw material remaining to Europeans.\" That seems like a key point. He also mentioned that US multinationals want to appropriate protected names like \"Feta cheese, Parmesan, Spreewaldgurken\" as trademarks for profit. \n\nAnother point from the summary is his criticism of procedural issues where the Council made a decision before the parliamentary debate, calling it \"unacceptable.\" So his arguments are about defending European quality, opposing multinational corporations taking over protected names, and criticizing the procedural timing of the Council's decision.\n\nI need to make sure I don't include anything from other speakers. For example, the PPE-DE group's points about regional authority involvement are from Giuseppe Castiglione and others, not Graefe. Similarly, the PSE group's comments are from Mar\u00eda Isabel Salinas Garc\u00eda. The critical voices like Witold Tomczak or Andrzej Tomasz Zapa\u0142owski are separate. \n\nThe user also mentioned that if there are no points, I should return an empty string. But in this case, there are clear points from the rapporteur. So the answer should list the three main points: defending European quality against multinationals, the quote about intellectual property, the specific examples of names being appropriated, and the criticism of the Council's procedural timing. \n\nWait, the summary says he \"argued that US multinationals wanted to appropriate protected names... for profit.\" So that's one point. Then the quote about intellectual property. Then the procedural issue where the Council decided before the debate. \n\nI need to present these as the main points. Let me check again to ensure I'm not including others. The rest of the summary's sections don't attribute anything else to him. The key is to stick strictly to the Rapporteur's Perspective section. \n\nYes, that's all. So the answer should list those three points.\n</think>\n\nFriedrich-Wilhelm Graefe zu Baringdorf (Verts/ALE) argued that the debate centered on defending European agricultural quality against multinational corporations seeking to exploit protected designations of origin. He asserted that \"intellectual property is the last raw material remaining to Europeans,\" emphasizing the need to prevent US multinationals from appropriating traditional names like \"Feta cheese, Parmesan, Spreewaldgurken\" as trademarks for profit. Additionally, he criticized the Council for making decisions before the parliamentary debate, calling this \"unacceptable\" and highlighting procedural flaws in the process.", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Neelie Kroes,", "english": "Neelie Kroes, Member of the Commission . Mr President, the rapporteur has received flowers from quite a number of honourable Members and, on behalf of the Commission, I should like to add a couple of flowers to the bouquet. Thank you again for the interesting exchange of views. Let me comment on some of the points raised during this debate.\nAs a general comment \u2013 Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf and Mr Castiglione touched upon this point \u2013 I should like to stress again that with these proposals the Commission wants to bring our legislation into conformity with the findings of the WTO panels. This includes numerous aspects of the procedure and elements of simplification, so the system can support the implementation of the WTO findings. That was a point mentioned by Mr\u00a0Allister and, in my opinion, it addresses his concerns.\nIn response to Mr Mulder, I reiterate the intention of the Commission to further review the various policy issues not related to the WTO findings and the wider issue of the agricultural quality policy in the EC over the next year. I have learnt a lot this evening, including the point Mr Mulder made about Edam cheese. I should explain to Mr Mulder that Edam is a type of cheese that can be produced anywhere. It is a Codex standard. However, North Holland Edam is protected, and that is a Dutch quality product. So eat more Edam from North Holland!\nLet me comment in more detail on the exchange of views and address some of the issues you have raised. Concerning the logos, the three logos established by Commission rules are already different from one another. I also want to make it clear that any advantage given to EC producers \u2013 and I believe the use of a Community symbol is such an advantage \u2013 will be equally open to third country producers. That answer is for Mr Castiglione and Mrs Herranz Garc\u00eda. However, the Commission agrees that this needs to be further explored. This will be done within the framework of the wider policy review, which the Commission intends to conduct as soon as this proposal has been implemented.\nSeveral amendments deal with the obligations of the Member States and the Commission, which Mr Podka\u0144ski mentioned. The Commission has no intention of altering the current distribution of competence between the Member States and the Commission.\nAmendments 23 and 24 ask for a time period for the Commission to scrutinise and publish applications. I agree that the Commission should carry out its duties within a reasonable period of time. Mrs Lulling and Mrs\u00a0Salinas Garc\u00eda touched upon that. I agree that we should take into account the definition of a reasonable period of time, which is not easy, given the complexity of applications. It is certainly not realistic to have all the applications scrutinised and published in six months; twelve months would be more acceptable.\nYour amendments on controls reflect the aim of the Commission proposal, which is to ensure that there is a clear understanding that all over the EC there are authorities in charge of enforcing the Community rules on geographical indications and traditional specialities. There is also no doubt that these controls will be carried out within the framework of Regulation (EC) No\u00a0882/2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law.\nThere are points that concern only the geographical indications report that I want to mention. These are the use of ingredients in processed products and the origin of raw materials. I confirm that your proposals concerning the use of protected names in relation to ingredients for processed products meet some of the Commission\u2019s concerns. However, the general rules on labelling already cover cases of misleading information. Further restrictions on the use of registered names for processed products would mean a major policy change that deserves to be adequately and thoroughly assessed.\nI took note of various amendments concerning the labelling of origin or other conditions applicable to raw materials. The Commission shares Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf\u2019s objective that people should not be misled in this respect. However, we have to be very prudent. Any policy change in this field may affect rights already granted to users of certain designations.\nFinally, I shall make a few points on the TSG report. The current regulation on traditional specialities guaranteed has no definition for the term \u2018traditional\u2019. We propose to introduce the obligation to prove usage for a time period of at least 25 years. We believe that this is a good compromise.\nAs a result, the Commission can in principle accept the following amendments in the report on geographical indications: Amendments 1, 10, 11, 15, 25, 29 and 31. Of the last-minute amendments tabled for this part-session, the Commission can in principle accept Amendments 41, 43, 49 and 54.

Let me start by reading through the debate summary carefully.\n\nFirst, the user mentioned that the task is to outline the main points or arguments made by the specified speaker, which in this case is Neelie Kroes. The user also emphasized that I should not include contributions from other speakers and only focus on the ones attributed to Neelie Kroes. If there are no points, I should return an empty string.\n\nLooking at the debate summary, there's a section titled \"Commission Position\" where Commissioner Neelie Kroes is mentioned. The summary says she outlined that the proposals aimed to achieve WTO compliance following panel conclusions by the US and Australia. She mentioned that over 700 geographical indications have been registered since 1993, representing a \u20ac10+ billion market. Then she states, \"If we simply conform to WTO rules without increasing the efficiency of the functioning of the system, the whole approval process could come to a standstill\" [Kroes, 2006-03-15]. The Commission proposed streamlining procedures, promoting Community logos, and ensuring equal treatment for third-country applications while maintaining the April 20, 2006 WTO deadline.\n\nSo, from this, the main points attributed to Neelie Kroes are:\n\n1. The proposals are about achieving WTO compliance due to panel decisions from the US and Australia.\n2. There are over 700 registered geographical indications since 1993, worth over \u20ac10 billion.\n3. She warns that without improving the system's efficiency, the approval process might stall.\n4. The Commission's proposals include streamlining procedures, promoting Community logos, and equal treatment for third-country applications, all while adhering to the WTO deadline.\n\nI need to make sure that these points are solely from Neelie Kroes and not from other speakers. The summary mentions other speakers like Graefe zu Baringdorf, but the user is asking specifically about Neelie Kroes. The other sections like the rapporteur's perspective, party group positions, etc., don't attribute points to her. The only part where she is mentioned is in the Commission Position section. \n\nTherefore, the answer should list these four points. I need to present them clearly, making sure not to include any other speaker's arguments. The user also mentioned that if there are no points, return an empty string, but in this case, there are points. So the final answer should be the four points as outlined.\n</think>\n\nThe Commission Position section attributes the following points to Neelie Kroes:  \n1. The proposals aim to achieve WTO compliance following panel rulings by the United States and Australia.  \n2. Over 700 geographical indications have been registered since 1993, representing a \u20ac10+ billion market.  \n3. Failure to improve the system's efficiency risks stalling the approval process.  \n4.

But the user is asking about the President's contributions. \n\nLooking through the sections, the Executive Summary mentions the Rapporteur, Friedrich-Wilhelm Graefe zu Baringdorf, and various party groups like PPE-DE, PSE, ALDE.

The summary includes statements from the Commission, rapporteur, and various speakers from different groups, but the President isn't listed as one of the 25 speakers. \n\nThe user's instruction says if there are no points attributed to the speaker, respond with an empty string. Since the summary doesn't mention the President speaking, the answer should be empty. I need to check again to make sure I didn't miss any part. The debate information lists 25 speakers, but the President isn't named among them. The President's role is usually to manage the debate, not to speak with arguments. Therefore, there's no information here about the President's arguments.
