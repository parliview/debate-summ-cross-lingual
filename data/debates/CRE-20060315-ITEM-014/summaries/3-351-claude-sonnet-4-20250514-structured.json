{"speaker": "Daniel Stro\u017e,", "english": "Daniel Stro\u017e, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group . \u2013 (CS) Mr President, Commissioner, on the topic of a proposal for a Council regulation on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs, I would like to draw attention to something that is said in the Graefe zu Baringdorf report, namely that intellectual property is the last raw material remaining to Europeans. It is precisely for this reason that we may express wonder and regret over the fact that we have so far had no targeted plan for developing a system specifically for the protection of intellectual property. The new instrument should finally eliminate the persistent disputes at the WTO between the EU and some of its trading partners. Once this matter has been resolved, we can only hope that the Commission will then return to the issue of geographical indications and designations of origin with clear conceptual aims.\nI would like to add that designations of origin and geographical indications constitute an integral component of intellectual property, according to the World Intellectual Property Organisation. Under the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament, the issue of intellectual property belongs unambiguously and exclusively to the remit of the Committee on Legal Affairs. It is therefore odd both from a procedural and a practical viewpoint that the drafting of this report was entrusted to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, without including in it even an opinion from the Committee on Legal Affairs.", "lang": "CS", "original": "Daniel Stro\u017e, za skupinu GUE/NGL . \u2013 V\u00e1\u017een\u00fd pane p\u0159edsedo, v\u00e1\u017een\u00e1 pan\u00ed komisa\u0159ko, pokud jde o n\u00e1vrh na\u0159\u00edzen\u00ed Rady o ochran\u011b zem\u011bpisn\u00fdch ozna\u010den\u00ed a ozna\u010den\u00ed p\u016fvodu zem\u011bd\u011blsk\u00fdch v\u00fdrobk\u016f a potravin, cht\u011bl bych zd\u016fraznit sentenci, kter\u00e1 se objevila ve zpr\u00e1v\u011b zpravodaje pana Graefe zu Baringdorf.
