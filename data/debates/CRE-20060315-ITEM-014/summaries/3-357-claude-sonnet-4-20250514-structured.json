In order to achieve this objective it is necessary to defend traditional specialities and geographical indications, even against attacks launched from inside the World Trade Organisation by the United States and Australia.\nThe rapporteur has done an excellent job to improve the two regulations. We need to protect products in order to have a real impact on improving food safety and prevent the homogenisation of flavour, which is occurring on a global scale. All too often, sadly, we find examples of counterfeiting: the largest market in southern Italy, Vittoria in Sicily, is every day flooded with counterfeit products that are put on the market as protected geographical indication products, for example Pachino cherry tomatoes.\nFor this reason, we believe that labelling is needed to reveal the indication of the place of origin and processing of a product. We must question ourselves, however, over one matter: all too often those in favour of the PDO and PGI scheme are more concerned with commercialisation than with production.", "lang": "IT", "original": "Giusto Catania (GUE/NGL). \u2013 Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, l\u2019Europa deve essere in grado di garantire e proteggere la qualit\u00e0 della sua produzione agricola e alimentare.

Purtroppo troppo spesso assistiamo a fenomeni di contraffazione: il pi\u00f9 grande mercato del Mezzogiorno d\u2019Italia, quello di Vittoria in Sicilia, ogni giorno \u00e8 attraversato da prodotti contraffatti che vengono immessi nel mercato come prodotti IGP, per esempio il pomodorino di Pachino.\nAllora per questo motivo riteniamo che sia necessaria un\u2019etichettatura che deve riportare l\u2019indicazione del luogo d\u2019origine e di trasformazione del prodotto.
