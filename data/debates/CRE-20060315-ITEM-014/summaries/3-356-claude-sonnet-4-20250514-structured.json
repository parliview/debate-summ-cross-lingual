I think that a transparent and simplified registration procedure and a clear division of competences between the Member States and the Commission will provide more effective protection for consumers and producers, citizens of the Union and, most of all, for those who manufacture these products. They will be protected from fake copies, the misuse of original names, the copying of lists of ingredients and other fraudulent practices used by people looking to make a quick profit.\nThe proposed regulations do indeed contribute to guaranteeing a credible system to protect the quality of registered products which are trusted and whose popularity is growing in the Union and across the world.
