The establishment of the protected designation of origin (PDO), the protected geographical indication (PGI) and the traditional speciality guaranteed (TSG) is a step in the right direction for the development of rural areas. It will help both to preserve natural and cultural heritage, and to extend the range of high-quality products to a growing number of demanding and well-informed consumers.\nI can bear witness to this from the experience of my country, in which more than 100 products have become subject to these arrangements, and most of them have registered reasonable commercial success. In some cases, the success of the market represents both the rehabilitation of indigenous breeds that had been heading for extinction and of operating methods which would otherwise have been seriously at risk or would have disappeared.\nThe thrust of the proposals before us will help to enhance the existing regulatory framework and bring it into line with WTO rules, with which we wish to comply. I wish to underline that clearer identification of Community symbols by means of colouring, identification of the origin and place of processing of products from third countries, and the fact that the Commission\u2019s decision was upheld, render the process more credible and will lead to cheaper prices and less bureaucracy.", "lang": "PT", "original": "Luis Manuel Capoulas Santos (PSE). \u2013 Senhor Presidente, Senhora Comiss\u00e1ria, tamb\u00e9m me associo \u00e0s felicita\u00e7\u00f5es ao nosso relator.
