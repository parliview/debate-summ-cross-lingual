It is something at which we can excel, at which we can surpass others and thanks to which we can build a European market that is a common market and yet is rich thanks to the variety of regional specialities. It is a great opportunity for regional producers. Most of all, however, it is good news for consumers as these products are made according to traditional recipes and using methods that go back generations and are healthier and better than mass-produced goods. It is also the best way to face the challenge presented by biotechnology companies. They want to force us to consume their mass-produced food which is the result of genetic engineering.\nWe should be clear on this matter. We want to consume products that are healthy, varied and produced using traditional, regional methods, and we do not want to be forced to consume food products made using methods that cheat nature.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Janusz Wojciechowski, on behalf of the UEN Group . \u2013 ( PL) Mr President, on behalf of the UEN Group I would like to congratulate Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf on his excellent reports.
