{"speaker": "Mairead McGuinness (PPE-DE). \u2013", "english": "Mairead McGuinness (PPE-DE). \u2013 Mr President, before I address the subject of today\u2019s debate, it is important that I record in this House the fact that the Irish sugar industry will cease production totally. The announcement was made today in Ireland. When we talk about the WTO, Ireland is their first casualty in terms of sugar beet production. Three hundred workers will lose their jobs and 3\u00a0500 farmers will be very badly affected. Is this the warning sign of what lies ahead, as the power of the WTO to shape our agriculture in Europe intensifies? If sugar beet is sacrificed today, as it has been in Ireland, what about EU beef farming tomorrow?\nWith regard to this report, I thank the rapporteur for his good work. However, I fear that we sometimes talk about this issue with great intensity \u2013 as we should \u2013 but ignore the bigger picture of commodity production in the European Union, which also needs protection.\nI regret that in Ireland we have only three products that are registered under the PGI\u00a0description, but we have many hundreds of small food companies that could take the protection offered by these regulations. I would urge them to do so. We will need more and more speciality products if we are to meet the challenges in terms of the reform of the CAP and the pressures of the WTO. We need to recognise that the continuation of food production in Europe depends on a commitment to the sector and a recognition that it cannot be expected to survive the onslaught of unlimited market access by low-cost commodities produced outside the Union at different and lower standards.\nBy all means let us protect and encourage those who want to produce speciality foods, but let us also recognise that EU agriculture produces high-specification commodities which are also in need of protection.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Mairead McGuinness (PPE-DE). \u2013 Mr President, before I address the subject of today\u2019s debate, it is important that I record in this House the fact that the Irish sugar industry will cease production totally.
