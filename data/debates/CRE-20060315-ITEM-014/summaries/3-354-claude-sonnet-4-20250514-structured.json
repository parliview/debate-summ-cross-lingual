We have to pay more for so-called \u2018organic\u2019 products in order to buy what should be normal food.\nIt is cynical to say that consumers today regard quality as more important than quantity. They simply want to eat food once again that they have not seen for a long time and to which they have a right. We, meanwhile, are spending most of our budget on the common agricultural policy, mainly in the old Member States.\nLet us hope that, by simplifying the current procedures, these regulations relating to the protection of geographical indications, designations of origin and traditional specialities will favour farmers who produce healthy and tasty produce.\nI would like to thank the Commission and the rapporteur for addressing this important issue. I hope that farmers, especially those from the new Member States who have not yet had the time or money to take up agricultural production on an industrial scale, will be rewarded for their traditional production methods. We do not have such splendid processing methods as those for which French cuisine is renowned, but we do have healthy, tasty farm produce and food.", "lang": "PL", "original": "Jan Tadeusz Masiel (NI). \u2013 Panie Przewodnicz\u0105cy!
