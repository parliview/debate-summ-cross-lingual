{"speaker": "Robert Navarro (PSE).", "english": "Robert Navarro (PSE). \u2013 (FR) Mr President, I should first like to congratulate the rapporteur and my fellow members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on this report, one of the strong points of which is that it emphasises a key concept, which is that Europe\u2019s farming will only survive on the basis of quality. Consequently, at the heart of any political measure taken by the EU, not least in international fora such as the World Trade Organisation, must be the defence of labels and other protected designations, as this is the only way of guaranteeing the sustainable competitiveness of European products in a globalised world.\nI personally come from a region that has more than 30 products registered under the protected designation of origin (PDO), protected geographical indication (PGI) and traditional speciality guaranteed (TSG) schemes. These designations are without question an asset for the producers who benefit from them. It is a similar idea to one we have always used in another sector, which does not fall under the scope of this text but which requires support and protection from Europe. I refer, of course, to the winemaking sector, which accounts for tens of thousands of jobs in my region, southern France, and hundreds of thousands of jobs around Europe, and which is currently enduring a major crisis. If nothing is done, including at European level, there is a danger that Europe will lose its soul.", "lang": "FR", "original": "Robert Navarro (PSE). - Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, je tiens tout d\u2019abord \u00e0 f\u00e9liciter le rapporteur et mes coll\u00e8gues de la commission de l\u2019agriculture et du d\u00e9veloppement rural pour ce rapport, qui a le m\u00e9rite d\u2019insister sur une notion fondamentale: l\u2019agriculture europ\u00e9enne ne survivra que par la qualit\u00e9.

Je parle bien entendu de la viticulture, qui repr\u00e9sente des dizaines de milliers d\u2019emplois dans ma r\u00e9gion, le Sud de la France, des centaines de milliers d\u2019emplois pour l\u2019Europe et qui conna\u00eet actuellement une crise grave.
