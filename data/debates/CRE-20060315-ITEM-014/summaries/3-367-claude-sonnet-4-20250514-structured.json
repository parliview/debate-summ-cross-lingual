His report managed, on the one hand, to steer clear of conservative protectionism, and, on the other, to show recognition and respect for our expertise. This will not please everyone, however, and the best proof of this is the firm line taken in the United States and Australia, which want geographical indications only to be admitted under exceptional circumstances and are seeking to have them restricted to certain wines and spirits.\nThe EU must do all it can to defend these geographical indications and must use all its diplomatic acumen, especially in the forthcoming negotiations on the transposition of the Hong Kong decisions. Geographical indications are an excellent way of delivering a qualitative approach to international trade. Unfortunately, there has not been a single sign of the geographical indications being sustainably enshrined at the WTO. The Commission must be capable of playing an important role in this respect.
