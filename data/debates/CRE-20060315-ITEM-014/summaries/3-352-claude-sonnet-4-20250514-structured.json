There are, however, doubts as to whether the aims set are realistic.\nLet us consider the result to date of existing solutions. Within the framework of guaranteed, traditional specialities only 15 agricultural and food products have so far been registered throughout the Union. Is it really necessary to create complex procedures and expand bureaucracy for the benefit of a dozen or a few dozen products? Will the farmer-producer really gain anything by it? Within the framework of the system for the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin over 700 names have been registered across the EU including 150 cheeses, 160 types of meat or meat products, 150 types of fruit and vegetables and 80 types of olive oil. There are 300 new applications pending examination. By creating this legislation, will we not soon find ourselves in a ridiculous position, bordering on the laughable? In a few years we will have thousands of original product names wanting to conquer supermarkets across the whole of the EU. As customers, we will be worn down by them and the costly bureacratic system will turn out to be inefficient when dealing with applications.\nWould it not be better to give up the idea of regulating local delicacies? If we turn delicacies into mass products, they will no longer be delicacies. Let them remain a natural attraction of particular places or regions, but without the support of the European Union.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Witold Tomczak, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . \u2013 ( PL) Mr President, the aims of both proposals for regulations seem well-founded.
