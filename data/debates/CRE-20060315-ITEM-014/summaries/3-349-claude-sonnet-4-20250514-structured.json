{"speaker": "Mar\u00eda Isabel Salinas Garc\u00eda,", "english": "Mar\u00eda Isabel Salinas Garc\u00eda, on behalf of the PSE Group . \u2013 (ES) Mr President, as the rapporteur has said quite rightly, I believe that quality is European agriculture\u2019s great asset.\nIn view of the global market in which we increasingly have to compete, as a result of extremely low labour costs, scant environmental and hygiene requirements \u2013 in other words, lower prices \u2013 I believe that quality must set us apart. We therefore need guaranteed and certified quality by means of a simpler and easily recognisable system in which the consumers have confidence, both inside and outside of Europe \u2013 and that is what we are working on.\nFurthermore, it is essential that these denominations are recognised outside of the Union, in the WTO, so that we can establish a market in high-quality agricultural products. We are working on that, and I believe that the work that has been done in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development supports this position.\nThe first challenge facing us is to strengthen our system of consumers and producers even further. We need a faster system, with clearly defined time periods and procedures, in which competences are properly allocated. I believe that the way the sector itself perceives it is as important as the way the consumers perceive it, and it must be shown the economic advantages of a high-quality market: the security of a system of denomination which properly controls the products that do not comply with the conditions set, and a quick and not too burdensome procedure.\nI believe that the issue that we are dealing with is very important, particularly for countries such as my own, which are pioneers of ecological agriculture. As I have said, I believe that this issue deserves more in-depth consideration, and we must do this once the requirements of the WTO \u2013 and this must happen as soon as possible \u2013 have been complied with, simplifying access to the system for third-country products.\nDuring the subsequent examination and reflection that we will hold in this House, I believe that it is essential to listen to the sector and to be attentive to its needs, thinking at all times of directing our products and our quality towards the global market, these being the values of a truly competitive European agri-food sector.", "lang": "ES", "original": "Mar\u00eda Isabel Salinas Garc\u00eda, en nombre del Grupo del PSE . \u2013 (ES) Se\u00f1or Presidente, como muy bien ha dicho nuestro ponente, creo que la calidad es el gran activo de la agricultura europea.\nAnte un mercado global en el que tenemos que competir, cada vez m\u00e1s, por \u00ednfimos costes de mano de obra, escasas exigencias medioambientales y de higiene, es decir, precios m\u00e1s bajos, creo que la calidad debe marcar la diferencia. Para ello, es necesaria \u2212y es en lo que estamos trabajando\u2212 una calidad garantizada y certificada por un sistema m\u00e1s sencillo, f\u00e1cilmente reconocible y que goce de la confianza de los consumidores, tanto en Europa como fuera de ella.\nEs imprescindible, adem\u00e1s, el reconocimiento de estas calificaciones en el exterior, en la OMC, para establecer as\u00ed un mercado de productos agr\u00edcolas de alta calidad. En ello estamos, y creo que el trabajo que se ha hecho en la Comisi\u00f3n de Agricultura y Desarrollo Rural avala esta postura.\nEl primer reto que se nos plantea es el de afianzar, a\u00fan m\u00e1s, el sistema de nuestros consumidores y productores. Es necesario un sistema m\u00e1s \u00e1gil, con plazos y tr\u00e1mites claramente determinados, en el que est\u00e9n bien asignadas las competencias. Para m\u00ed tan importante como la percepci\u00f3n del consumidor es tambi\u00e9n la del propio sector, al que se le deben mostrar las ventajas econ\u00f3micas de un mercado de alta calidad: la seguridad de un sistema de calificaci\u00f3n que controle bien los productos que no cumplen las condiciones fijadas y un procedimiento \u00e1gil y no demasiado gravoso.\nCreo que el tema que estamos tratando es muy importante, sobre todo para pa\u00edses, como el m\u00edo, que son pioneros en la agricultura ecol\u00f3gica. Creo que el tema merece, como he dicho, una reflexi\u00f3n m\u00e1s amplia, que debemos afrontar una vez cumplidas, lo antes posible, las exigencias de la OMC, simplificando el acceso al sistema de productos de terceros pa\u00edses.\nEn la profundizaci\u00f3n y reflexi\u00f3n posterior que tendremos en esta C\u00e1mara, creo que es imprescindible escuchar al sector y estar atentos a sus necesidades, pensando siempre en la proyecci\u00f3n hacia el mercado global de nuestros productos y de nuestra calidad, que son los valores de un sector agroalimentario europeo realmente competitivo.", "agenda_item": "Agricultural products and foodstuffs as traditional specialities guaranteed \u2013 Protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060315-ITEM-014", "intervention_id": "3-349", "summary_english": "{\n\"headline\": \"Quality Must Distinguish European Agriculture in Global Market Through Stronger Protection System\",\n\"issueSum\": \"The speaker identifies the challenge of European agriculture competing in a global market against products with lower labor costs and fewer environmental/hygiene requirements.
