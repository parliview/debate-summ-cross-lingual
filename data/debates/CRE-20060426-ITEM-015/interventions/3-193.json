We should not commit the mistake of jumping to premature conclusions. This is the time to investigate, to ask the questions and to get the answers so that we can throw full light on what has happened.\nLet there be no doubt that we shall be asking all the pertinent questions and we shall expect full and adequate replies. If it is found that Parliament was indeed overcharged, then we shall not hesitate to say as Mr\u00a0Pom\u00e9s Ruiz reminded us, that we want our money back. This is taxpayers\u2019 money and we shall certainly ask for it to be paid back.\nI support the rapporteur\u2019s proposal to vote against the discharge and consequently postpone it because we have no other option. This could have been avoided had the Budgetary Control Committee been informed about these allegations before adopting its report on the discharge of Parliament\u2019s budget a month ago. In the event, the Budgetary Control Committee adopted its report in blissful ignorance of what was going on.\nSo our immediate task is to investigate these matters urgently, thoroughly and transparently so as to ensure that the financial interests of the European Union, but also of European taxpayers, are adequately protected. This is what taxpayers expect from us today.\n(Applause)", "lang": "EN", "original": "Simon Busuttil (PPE-DE). \u2013 Mr President, in the light of the serious allegations concerning the rent and purchase by the European Parliament of two buildings in Strasbourg, this House must emphasise that it is taking immediate steps to investigate these allegations in a prompt, rigorous and transparent manner.
