{"speaker": "Edith Mastenbroek (PSE).", "english": "Edith Mastenbroek (PSE). \u2013 Mr President, the risk of debates like this is always that Members start repeating what others have said. So firstly let me start by repeating the criticism that a number of Members of this House have made concerning the timing of this debate. It is a scandal that we are not having this debate at a time that would do justice to the importance of the reports that we are discussing.\nI would like to agree with Mr Staes in saying that Mr\u00a0Ferber\u2019s report was excellent. The PSE Group has absolutely no problems with the report as it is presented right now. It calls for an assistants\u2019 statute and a dialogue with the Bureau about their political role: these are all things that we welcome. However, I think that we will see an overwhelming majority from all the political groups behind his proposal not to grant discharge tomorrow, and I welcome that. It is only right.\nIt is only right that we will not grant discharge to a report that would say that it is ok that we pay X amount of rent that we now all know is probably too high. In fact I do not agree with the Members that said that the press statement that Strasbourg sent out today is only adding to the lack of clarity. It is very clear what they are saying. It says here on the second page of the press statement that they need money for services rendered and that there is a risk of the building at one point being empty and that risk needs to be financed. I am sorry, but where was the invoice for this? We are the Budgetary Control Committee! We are supposed to check these things, so that is what we are going to be doing.\nAnother paragraph states that Julian Priestley\u2019s decision to stop paying the rent is actually a breach of the contract. I would like to see the contract which states that what we have been paying is the right amount of money. If it is not the right amount of money, it is only right that we have this committee of inquiry.\nTherefore I welcome the decision to start this working party. I also agree with Mr\u00a0Stubb that it is not a discussion about Strasbourg as our seat, but we all know that it will at some point become a discussion about our seat. We should all keep cool heads, but my opinion about that latter issue is clear to everybody in this room that wants to know.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Edith Mastenbroek (PSE). \u2013 Mr President, the risk of debates like this is always that Members start repeating what others have said.
