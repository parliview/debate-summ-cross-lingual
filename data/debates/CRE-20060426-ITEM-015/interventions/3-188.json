Yet this is not how EU funds are being applied. I have in my hand a letter from the Finance Minister in my region which admits that EU funds acquired for Northern Ireland are diverted instead directly into the UK central Exchequer and are thereby used to reduce the level of UK-wide taxation and borrowing that is then necessary.\nThat defeats additionality and cheats a region like mine out of funds intended by Europe to provide true additional expenditure there. I would therefore call for the regulation governing the new financial perspective from 2007 to expressly require Member States to demonstrate that true additionality is delivered to the regions in whose name funding is claimed from Europe. Only then will the objective of obtaining genuine economic impact be secured for those regions. This cheating of the regions has gone on for years.
