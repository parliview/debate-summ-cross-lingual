Mulder (ALDE),", "english": "Jan Mulder (ALDE), rapporteur . \u2013 (NL) Mr President, around 3\u00a0p.m. this afternoon, I asked at roughly what time I would be given the floor, and I was told at around 5.45\u00a0p.m. It is now 7.45\u00a0p.m. I do not know who had the wisdom to compile this agenda, but I do not think it does Parliament any favours to hold a discharge debate about the European institutions at this time of day.\nMoving on to the order of the day and cutting to the chase, I would advise the House to grant discharge to the Commission in respect of the financial year 2004. This may come as a surprise to you, because as everyone knows and as probably many people will say, the Court of Auditors has not issued a Statement of Assurance about the Commission\u2019s conduct of policy for 11 years in a row. So what is the use of granting discharge? I have two arguments to put to you in favour. Firstly, this Commission was in office for roughly one month in 2004 and secondly, this Commission started very ambitiously with a view to achieving a positive Statement of Assurance. I will return to this in a moment.\nAlthough it is unfortunate that Mr\u00a0Wynn is absent, I should like to start with last year\u2019s resolution which he compiled and in which he introduced a number of fresh elements, the key one being that we felt that the highest political authority in every Member State should make a declaration at the beginning and end of each financial year to the effect that everything is in order in terms of political control. It is unfortunate that this demand by Parliament has met with much resistance in the Member States.\nThere have been a number of developments since then. An Interinstitutional Agreement has been concluded in which we have reached a compromise with the Council to the effect that it does not matter whether the political level is the highest or not. We will also accept a declaration at any level that is suitable for this purpose in every Member State, provided that this declaration is made. I would like to find out from the Commission what it intends to do with the Interinstitutional Agreement.\nAnother development has been the fact that some countries are now saying that they object to this. I should like to find out what the Commission\u2019s response to this position is, because I get the impression that more and more countries are sharing this view. I have to say in all of this is that it is never the Member States that are solely responsible; it is always the Commission that carries ultimate responsibility.\nWe should welcome the Commission\u2019s action plan with open arms. It is a good thing that common standards are introduced, that integrated control is in place, that there is better cooperation with national courts of auditors, and suchlike. We would also appreciate it, in a different connection, if the Commission were to identify risk areas in the budget, namely what the high-risk and low-risk areas are. It is therefore important that Member States should shoulder their political responsibility. This is something we also demand from the Commission itself. Not only the Director-General should sign for the annual accounts; we think that the Commissioner who is responsible for a specific policy area should also be required to add their signature.\nI will have to speed through my speech because the clock is ticking. The President of the Court of Auditors once again published his annual report in November and made an interesting suggestion. He put forward the idea of a peer review, which means that ex-presidents of national courts of auditors should examine whether or not the methodology and working practices of their counterpart at European level are correct. We see this as important and applaud this suggestion; we are keen to play an active role in this with the European Court of Auditors.\nThere is yet more work to be done by the European Court of Auditors. In the discharge report, a specific request was made for two reports, in the first instance about the management of the funds granted by the European Union to the UN bodies. What is the added value for Europe if we give the money via the United Nations? Secondly, what is financial control like over there?\nWe also want the non-governmental organisation to be the subject of an investigation by the Court of Auditors for a change. What is the \u2018non-governmental\u2019 proportion in those non-governmental organisations? How much money do they have at their own disposal?\nFinally, the next few years will prove crucial to the Commission. There must be a positive Statement of Assurance at some point.\nI am very grateful to the members of the Secretariat of COCOBU for their enormous efficiency and skill, and, needless to say, also to my personal staff.", "lang": "NL", "original": "Jan Mulder (ALDE), rapporteur . - Voorzitter, vanmiddag om een uur of drie vroeg ik hoe laat ik ongeveer zou moeten spreken en toen werd mij gezegd dat het ongeveer kwart voor zes zou zijn. Het is nu kwart voor acht. Ik weet niet wie de wijsheid heeft gehad om deze agenda samen te stellen, maar ik geloof niet dat het goed is voor het Parlement dat een kwijtingsdebat over de Europese instellingen op dit moment van de dag plaatsvindt.\nOm over te gaan tot de orde van de dag en om maar meteen met de deur in huis te vallen: de kwijting van de Commissie over het begrotingsjaar 2004. Ik beveel dit Parlement aan om kwijting te verlenen. Eigenlijk is dat een verrassing, want zoals iedereen weet en waarschijnlijk ook vele mensen zullen zeggen, geeft de Europese Rekenkamer al elf jaar op rij geen betrouwbaarheidsverklaring over het gevoerde beleid van de Commissie. Waarom dan toch kwijting verlenen? Ik heb daar twee argumenten voor. In de eerste plaats is deze Commissie in het jaar 2004 pakweg \u00e9\u00e9n maand in functie geweest en in de tweede plaats is deze Commissie zeer ambitieus begonnen om w\u00e9l tot een positieve betrouwbaarheidsverklaring te komen. Ik kom daar nog op terug.\nJammer dat Terry Wynn hier niet is, maar ik zou willen beginnen met de resolutie van vorig jaar van zijn hand, die toen een aantal nieuwe elementen bracht. Het belangrijkste element daarvan was wel dat wij vonden dat de hoogste politieke autoriteit in iedere lidstaat aan het begin en het eind van ieder begrotingsjaar een verklaring moet afleggen dat wat de politieke controle betreft alles in orde is . Deze eis van het Parlement is op grote weerstand gestoten in de lidstaten en dat is jammer.\nOndertussen is er het een en ander gebeurd. We hebben een Interinstitutioneel Akkoord gesloten en daarin hebben wij een compromis bereikt met de Raad, waarin wij zeggen dat het er niet toe doet of het nu wel of niet op het hoogste politieke niveau is. Wij nemen ook genoegen met een verklaring op een bepaald niveau dat daarvoor geschikt is in iedere lidstaat, als die verklaring maar wordt afgelegd. Mijn vraag aan de Commissie is wat zij met het Interinstitutioneel Akkoord gaat doen.\nTen tweede zijn er in de tussentijd een aantal ontwikkelingen geweest, namelijk dat sommige landen nu zeggen dat ze daar bezwaar tegen hebben. Wat doet de Commissie met die houding? Er sluiten zich daar namelijk steeds meer landen bij aan, heb ik de indruk. Ik moet bij dit alles zeggen, het zijn nooit de lidstaten die alleen verantwoordelijk zijn. Het is altijd de Europese Commissie die de uiteindelijke verantwoordelijkheid heeft.\nHet actieplan van de Commissie moeten wij zeer verwelkomen. Het is goed dat er gemeenschappelijke standaarden komen, dat er een ge\u00efntegreerde controle is, dat er betere samenwerking met de nationale rekenkamers is, enzovoort. En wij zouden het ook op prijs stellen in een ander verband dat de Commissie risicogebieden in de begroting zou aangeven, namelijk wat hoge risicogebieden en gebieden met een laag risico zijn. Het is dus belangrijk dat de lidstaten politieke verantwoordelijkheid afleggen. Dat vragen wij ook van de Commissie zelf. Niet alleen de directeur-generaal moet tekenen over de jaarrekening. Wij vinden dat de commissaris die verantwoordelijk is voor een bepaald beleid, ook mede moet ondertekenen.\nIk moet snel door de punten heengaan want de klok loopt. De president van de Europese Rekenkamer heeft in november weer zijn jaarlijks verslag gepubliceerd en heeft een interessante suggestie gedaan. Hij stelde voor dat een peer review zou plaatsvinden, dat oud-presidenten van nationale rekenkamers eens gaan kijken of de methodologie en de werkwijze van de Europese Rekenkamer al dan niet correct is. Dat vinden wij een belangrijke zaak, wij juichen het toe en we willen daar graag met de Europese Rekenkamer aan meewerken.\nEr is nog meer werk aan de winkel voor de Europese Rekenkamer. In het kwijtingsverslag wordt specifiek gevraagd om twee verslagen. In de eerste plaats over het beheer van het geld dat de Europese Unie geeft aan organen van de Verenigde Naties. Wat is de toegevoegde waarde voor Europa als wij het geld via de Verenigde Naties geven? En in de tweede plaats hoe is de financi\u00eble controle daar?\nWij willen eveneens dat de niet-gouvernementele organisaties ook eens het onderwerp zijn van een onderzoek van de Rekenkamer. Hoeveel 'niet-gouvernementeel' is er aan die niet-gouvernementele organisaties? Hoeveel geld hebben zij zelf?\nTenslotte, de komende jaren worden essentieel voor de Commissie. Er moet een keer een positieve betrouwbaarheidsverklaring komen.\nIk wil de leden van het secretariaat van COCOBU zeer bedanken voor hun grote effici\u00ebntie en bekwaamheid, en uiteraard ook mijn persoonlijke medewerkers.", "agenda_item": "Discharges for the implementation of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2004 (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060426-ITEM-015", "intervention_id": "3-160", "summary_english": "```json\n{\n  \"headline\": \"Rapporteur recommends granting discharge to Commission for 2004 despite 11-year absence of positive audit statement\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"The key issues raised include the Court of Auditors' failure to issue a Statement of Assurance for the Commission for 11 consecutive years, resistance from Member States to Parliament's demand for political declarations on financial control, the need for better financial oversight mechanisms, and concerns about EU funding to UN bodies and NGOs.\",\n  \"positionSum\": \"The speaker supports granting discharge to the Commission for 2004, despite the ongoing audit concerns.

This may come as a surprise to you, because as everyone knows and as probably many people will say, the Court of Auditors has not issued a Statement of Assurance about the Commission\u2019s conduct of policy for 11 years in a row. So what is the use of granting discharge? I have two arguments to put to you in favour. Firstly, this Commission was in office for roughly one month in 2004 and secondly, this Commission started very ambitiously with a view to achieving a positive Statement of Assurance. I will return to this in a moment.\nAlthough it is unfortunate that Mr\u00a0Wynn is absent, I should like to start with last year\u2019s resolution which he compiled and in which he introduced a number of fresh elements, the key one being that we felt that the highest political authority in every Member State should make a declaration at the beginning and end of each financial year to the effect that everything is in order in terms of political control. It is unfortunate that this demand by Parliament has met with much resistance in the Member States.\nThere have been a number of developments since then. An Interinstitutional Agreement has been concluded in which we have reached a compromise with the Council to the effect that it does not matter whether the political level is the highest or not. We will also accept a declaration at any level that is suitable for this purpose in every Member State, provided that this declaration is made. I would like to find out from the Commission what it intends to do with the Interinstitutional Agreement.\nAnother development has been the fact that some countries are now saying that they object to this. I should like to find out what the Commission\u2019s response to this position is, because I get the impression that more and more countries are sharing this view. I have to say in all of this is that it is never the Member States that are solely responsible; it is always the Commission that carries ultimate responsibility.\nWe should welcome the Commission\u2019s action plan with open arms. It is a good thing that common standards are introduced, that integrated control is in place, that there is better cooperation with national courts of auditors, and suchlike. We would also appreciate it, in a different connection, if the Commission were to identify risk areas in the budget, namely what the high-risk and low-risk areas are. It is therefore important that Member States should shoulder their political responsibility. This is something we also demand from the Commission itself. Not only the Director-General should sign for the annual accounts; we think that the Commissioner who is responsible for a specific policy area should also be required to add their signature.\nI will have to speed through my speech because the clock is ticking. The President of the Court of Auditors once again published his annual report in November and made an interesting suggestion. He put forward the idea of a peer review, which means that ex-presidents of national courts of auditors should examine whether or not the methodology and working practices of their counterpart at European level are correct. We see this as important and applaud this suggestion; we are keen to play an active role in this with the European Court of Auditors.\nThere is yet more work to be done by the European Court of Auditors. In the discharge report, a specific request was made for two reports, in the first instance about the management of the funds granted by the European Union to the UN bodies. What is the added value for Europe if we give the money via the United Nations? Secondly, what is financial control like over there?\nWe also want the non-governmental organisation to be the subject of an investigation by the Court of Auditors for a change. What is the \u2018non-governmental\u2019 proportion in those non-governmental organisations? How much money do they have at their own disposal?\nFinally, the next few years will prove crucial to the Commission. There must be a positive Statement of Assurance at some point.\nI am very grateful to the members of the Secretariat of COCOBU for their enormous efficiency and skill, and, needless to say, also to my personal staff."}, {"speaker": "Markus Ferber (PPE-DE),", "english": "Markus Ferber (PPE-DE), rapporteur . \u2013 (DE) Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by saying that I was somewhat surprised that there seems to have been enough time for so many important things like one-minute speeches, while the question of whether European taxpayers' money is being spent properly is being dealt with around the evening suspension.\nSecondly, I would have been happy if I could have reported today, like the rapporteur on the Commission's budget, that Parliament's authorities had done everything properly, and that we just had a few problems because many of the positions created in connection with the enlargement had not been filled, because we had the highest non-implementation rate, in other words transfers, ever seen in the history of Parliament's budget, and a few other issues.\nIn the last few days, however, a story has come to light that clearly needs to be brought up here because of its peculiarities. I do think it is wise that we are not going to discharge Parliament's budget at the present. However, I would also make it quite clear that I find it regrettable that the services of Parliament have not authorised a procedure that would have made it possible to explain why we are not discharging it. I think that what this Parliament's Legal Service delivered this afternoon in the Committee on Budgetary Control, against the interests of the Members \u2013 and, I might add, Mr Vice-President, against the interests of the Bureau \u2013 was unacceptable. It is an unacceptable situation, and that alone requires special consideration.\nThere is something else that is equally unacceptable. We need to look into whether the city of Strasbourg, in providing a property on which a Dutch pension fund has constructed a building, has concluded a rental agreement with us for a sum significantly different from the sum that it pays to the pension fund \u2013 and not to the detriment of Strasbourg, but to its benefit. To be absolutely clear, this is not about the issue of having the seat of Parliament in Strasbourg \u2013 that is laid down in the Treaties \u2013 but about whether it is really the purpose of such a sub-letting situation that, in the rent we are paying to the city of Strasbourg, we are giving a direct subsidy \u2013 for that is exactly what it would be \u2013 to the city's budget. Given that this agreement was not just signed yesterday but, if the information I currently have is correct, has been in place since 1980, we also need to look into the issue of who in this House already knew about the situation in the past and who failed to protect the interests of European tax-payers in this connection by concluding the rental agreement directly with the pension fund. If this had been done, we would have been able to rent the building more cheaply. If, therefore, anyone in this House knew about this and did not act in the interests of European tax-payers, that is worthy of particular scrutiny. That is exactly what we are going to do together.\nTherefore, I can really only request \u2013 it is just a request at the moment, though the Rules of Procedure provide other options for the later procedure \u2013 that the administration provide all the information it has at its disposal. I can also only request the city of Strasbourg to provide all the information it has and to cooperate very closely with Parliament on this matter. If it does not do so, and if the debate on this is used only as a pretext for arguing that the European Parliament is looking for a good opportunity to leave Strasbourg for good, then the city of Strasbourg itself will have contributed to an event that it did not want to occur.\nThat is really where my call is coming from \u2013 I read the city of Strasbourg's press release from this afternoon, and, from what I understood of it with my rudimentary French, this is not the kind of cooperation I have in mind. The city of Strasbourg is already profiting from the European Parliament without needing such payments. That is why I am asking them to cooperate with us to clear up the matter: it is the only way that we will be able to act in the interests of tax-payers, and we will then be able to draw the correct conclusions I therefore regret \u2013 although I should like to thank everyone who worked with me in preparing the report, the services, the Committee Secretariat and my fellow Members \u2013 that I have to recommend that you vote against the report tomorrow and do not give discharge in respect of the budget, so that we can look seriously into all the matters I have mentioned.\n(Applause)", "lang": "DE", "original": "Markus Ferber (PPE-DE), Berichterstatter . \u2013 Herr Pr\u00e4sident, Herr Kommissionsvizepr\u00e4sident, liebe Kolleginnen, liebe Kollegen! Zun\u00e4chst einmal m\u00f6chte ich schon ein bisschen meine Verwunderung dar\u00fcber zum Ausdruck bringen, dass f\u00fcr viele wichtige Dinge wie die Ein-Minuten-Redebeitr\u00e4ge ausreichend Zeit vorhanden war, w\u00e4hrend die Frage, ob das europ\u00e4ische Steuerzahlergeld ordentlich ausgegeben wird, jetzt um die Abendunterbrechung herum behandelt wird.\nZweitens w\u00e4re ich froh gewesen, wenn ich heute \u00e4hnlich wie der Berichterstatter f\u00fcr den Kommissionshaushalt h\u00e4tte berichten k\u00f6nnen, dass die Parlamentsverwaltung alles ordentlich gemacht hat, dass wir lediglich ein paar Probleme hatten, weil sie viele Stellen, die damals im Zusammenhang mit der Erweiterung geschaffen worden waren, nicht besetzt hat, weil wir die gr\u00f6\u00dfte Nichtausf\u00fchrungsquote, sprich Mittel\u00fcbertragung, hatten, die es in der Geschichte des Parlamentshaushalts je gegeben hat, und ein paar andere Dinge mehr.\nAber in den letzten Tagen ist eine Geschichte hochgekommen, die nat\u00fcrlich aufgrund ihrer Besonderheit hier auch entsprechend erw\u00e4hnt werden muss. Ich glaube schon, dass es klug ist, dass wir zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt f\u00fcr den Parlamentshaushalt keine Entlastung erteilen. Ich sage aber auch sehr deutlich, dass ich es bedauere, dass die Dienste dieses Hauses ein Verfahren nicht zugelassen haben, das es erm\u00f6glicht h\u00e4tte, auch klarzulegen, warum wir keine Entlastung erteilen. Ich halte das f\u00fcr inakzeptabel, was heute Mittag im Haushaltskontrollausschuss vom Juristischen Dienst dieses Hauses gegen die Interessen \u2013 \u00fcbrigens, Herr Vizepr\u00e4sident, auch des Pr\u00e4sidiums \u2013 und gegen die Interessen der Abgeordneten abgeliefert wurde. Das ist ein inakzeptabler Vorgang, und der allein bedarf einer besonderen W\u00fcrdigung.\nEin zweiter Punkt ist ebenso wenig akzeptabel. Es wird zu pr\u00fcfen sein, ob die Stadt Stra\u00dfburg aufgrund der Tatsache, dass sie ein Grundst\u00fcck zur Verf\u00fcgung gestellt hat, auf dem ein niederl\u00e4ndischer Pensionsfonds ein Geb\u00e4ude errichtet hat, sich mit uns in einem Mietverh\u00e4ltnis befindet mit einem Betrag, der sich von dem Betrag, den sie dann an den Pensionsfonds weitergibt, deutlich unterscheidet \u2013 und zwar nicht zu Lasten der Stadt Stra\u00dfburg, sondern zu Gunsten der Stadt Stra\u00dfburg. Ich sage hier auch in aller Deutlichkeit: Es geht nicht um die Frage des Sitzes in Stra\u00dfburg \u2013 die ist in den Vertr\u00e4gen geregelt\u00a0\u2013, sondern es geht um die Frage, ob es wirklich Sinn und Zweck einer solchen Kettenvertragssituation ist, dass wir \u00fcber den Mietpreis, den wir an die Stadt Stra\u00dfburg zahlen, eine direkte Beihilfe \u2013 und etwas anderes w\u00e4re es nicht \u2013 an den st\u00e4dtischen Haushalt der Stadt Stra\u00dfburg geben. Nachdem dieses Vertragsverh\u00e4ltnis aber nicht erst seit gestern besteht, sondern dies, wenn die Informationen, die mir bisher zur Verf\u00fcgung stehen, stimmen, schon seit 1980 stattgefunden hat, wird auch die Frage zu kl\u00e4ren sein, wer in diesem Hause auch in der Vergangenheit \u00fcber diese Dinge Bescheid gewusst hat und wer keinen Beitrag dazu geleistet hat, dass die Interessen der europ\u00e4ischen Steuerzahler in diesem Zusammenhang gewahrt wurden, die ja gewahrt worden w\u00e4ren, wenn wir den Mietvertrag direkt mit diesem Pensionsfonds abgeschlossen h\u00e4tten. Dann h\u00e4tten wir das Geb\u00e4ude ja wohl billiger bekommen. Wenn also hier im Hause jemand so etwas gewusst und nicht im Interesse der europ\u00e4ischen Steuerzahler gehandelt hat, dann ist das auch eine besondere \u00dcberpr\u00fcfung wert. Das sind jetzt genau die Dinge, die wir miteinander tun werden.\nIch kann deswegen wirklich nur bitten \u2013 momentan bitten, die Gesch\u00e4ftsordnung bietet f\u00fcr die weitere Prozedur auch andere M\u00f6glichkeiten\u00a0\u2013, dass die Verwaltung alle ihr vorliegenden Informationen zur Verf\u00fcgung stellt. Ich kann auch die Stadt Stra\u00dfburg nur bitten, alle Informationen zur Verf\u00fcgung zu stellen und hier mit dem Parlament sehr eng und kooperativ zusammenzuarbeiten. Wenn sie das n\u00e4mlich nicht tut, und wenn alles nur unter der Frage diskutiert wird, das Europ\u00e4ische Parlament suche eine schnelle Gelegenheit, Stra\u00dfburg f\u00fcr immer zu verlassen, dann wird die Stadt Stra\u00dfburg selbst einen Beitrag dazu leisten, dass das eintritt, was sie selbst gar nicht will.\nDeswegen wirklich meine Aufforderung \u2013 ich habe die Presseerkl\u00e4rung der Stadt Stra\u00dfburg von heute Nachmittag auch gelesen, mit meinem rudiment\u00e4ren Franz\u00f6sisch habe ich sie so weit aber verstanden; dies ist noch nicht die Form der Zusammenarbeit, die ich mir vorstelle. Die Stadt Stra\u00dfburg profitiert vom Europ\u00e4ischen Parlament, ohne dass sie auf solche Zahlungen angewiesen w\u00e4re. Deswegen auch hier meine Bitte, eng mit uns zusammenzuarbeiten, die Dinge aufzukl\u00e4ren. Nur so werden wir auch im Interesse der Steuerzahler handeln k\u00f6nnen. Und wir werden dann auch die richtigen Schlussfolgerungen daraus ziehen. Deswegen bedauere ich \u2013 obwohl ich mich bei allen bedanke, die im Vorfeld mitgearbeitet haben, bei den Diensten, dem Ausschusssekretariat, bei den Kolleginnen und Kollegen\u00a0\u2013, dass ich Ihnen empfehlen muss, morgen gegen den Bericht zu stimmen, die Entlastung nicht zu erteilen, damit wir all die Dinge, die ich angesprochen habe, seri\u00f6s aufkl\u00e4ren k\u00f6nnen.\n(Beifall)", "agenda_item": "Discharges for the implementation of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2004 (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060426-ITEM-015", "intervention_id": "3-161", "summary_english": "{\n\"headline\": \"MEP refuses budget discharge due to potential Parliament subsidy to Strasbourg through inflated rental agreement\",\n\"issueSum\": \"The speaker raises concerns about a rental agreement between the European Parliament and the city of Strasbourg for Parliament buildings, where Strasbourg may be receiving significantly more rent from Parliament than it pays to the Dutch pension fund that owns the building.

This lack of confidence in the EU is, unfortunately, well deserved. The EU does not demonstrate a convincing resolve to clamp down on irregularities, fraud and the abuse of power in its institutions. In practice, there is little readiness to demand accountability. The instinct is to cover things up. Whistle-blowers lose their jobs instead of receiving praise. Cheating and scandals are not investigated, and no legal proceedings are brought in connection with those that are. Discharge is granted in spite of the fact that we do not know if everything has proceeded correctly.\nA majority of this Chamber appears to want to conceal unpleasant truths about the European Union from people so that the EU does not become still more unpopular. That is a deeply undemocratic attitude. Our task is to elicit the truth and to demand accountability on our citizens\u2019 behalf, not to conceal the truth from them.\nAs rapporteur for the Committee on Budgetary Control, it was my job to work on the issue of granting discharge to \u2018Other Institutions\u2019, of which there are seven in total. I have found no reason for bringing the Ombudsman and the Data Protection Supervisor into question. Four of the remaining five institutions are open to criticism, but not of so serious a character that there is reason for questioning whether discharge should be granted. The Council, the European Court of Justice, the Court of Auditors and the European Economic and Social Committee are in this position. Where the Committee of the Regions is concerned, however, I find that further investigations are required before we can take a decision on the issue of granting discharge.\nIn the course of 2004, the European Economic and Social Committee had problems involving irregularities in relation to the reimbursement of members\u2019 travelling expenses. We hope that this problem is now in the past. There have been problems with the Belliard\u00a0I and\u00a0II buildings, and I expect a full account of these in the Court of Auditors\u2019 forthcoming report.\nWhere the Council is concerned, many of the risks are to be found, as usual, in administrative activities relating to the building projects in which the Council is involved. I want to take this opportunity to emphasise the advantages of renting buildings instead of engaging in such huge building projects ourselves. It would also be helpful if the Council were to come up with clearer definitions of, respectively, administrative and operational expenses.\nThe European Court of Justice\u2019s internal audits were far from satisfactory during 2004. Its internal auditor also acted as the head of the ex-ante verification unit, which is quite simply unacceptable. Moreover, the internal auditor has not completed any of his investigations since he was appointed in 2003. Parliament expects to see energetic measures and strong improvements in this area.\nThe European Court of Justice\u2019s massive building projects at present under way cannot be anything other than a cause of disquiet. It is therefore essential that a complete and detailed progress report on this project be made to the Committee on Budgetary Control.\nThe fact that the Court does not at present require judges to declare their financial interests is unacceptable. Irrespective of whether or not there is at present any legal requirement for them to do so, the Court must prepare its own binding rules in this area. Regarding the use of official cars, Parliament again calls on the Court not to allow these to be used for private purposes.\nWhere the Court of Auditors is concerned, the fact that a handful of large Luxembourg-based accounting firms are in a dominant position when it comes to scrutinising the Court\u2019s accounts is worrying, although Parliament appreciates that it is difficult for the Court to avoid this situation. It is therefore extremely important for there to be an open, fair and comprehensible tendering procedure.\nThe Court of Auditors has problems with its organisational structure, which is in need of reform. This is something that needs to be got to grips with in the ongoing evaluation preparatory to overhauling the organisation of the Court, preferably in accordance with the proposal for reform devised by the British House of Lords.\nAgain, Parliament should call on the Court of Auditors not to permit the use of official cars for private purposes.\nI turn now to our black sheep, namely the Committee of the Regions which, of the \u2018Other Institutions\u2019 examined, has attracted the most criticism from the Court of Auditors. During 2004, the internal audit was in practice carried out by a single internal auditor, and a temporary one at that. An internal auditor dependent on a constantly renewable employment contract must find it very difficult to maintain his or her independence from the management of the organisation concerned. It is indefensible that the Committee of the Regions should not, then, have had a proper internal audit carried out during 2004, in spite of Parliament\u2019s robust criticism of that institution in relation to 2003. We have still not received any explanation of the fact that the internal auditor employed up until May 2004 was in no position to produce any auditor\u2019s reports.\nThere continues an OLAF investigation into the Committee of the Regions in connection with its reimbursement of members\u2019 expenses, to which a correction coefficient was applied. Payments for which there was no underlying proof of entitlement had been granted. It seems obvious that this should have been discovered by the Committee of the Regions no later than in the course of 2004 and that these payments should then have been stopped. In spite of this, the Committee\u2019s managers state that there is no question of there having been any cases of fraud. In connection with this matter, no clear information has been given, either, of measures having been taken to claim back incorrect payments. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that these payments were to people in key positions within the administration. In recent years, the Committee of the Regions has been partly characterised by irregularities of various kinds, showing that the promised culture change within the organisation has not taken place. It now looks as if OLAF will produce its final report in the middle of May. It would be irresponsible to grant discharge before we know the results of this investigation.\nThe reorganisation of the Committee of the Regions has in several cases meant that people involved in suspected irregularities have been promoted, which is also irregular.\nThe Court of Auditors is continuing with its investigation in connection with the Belliard\u00a0I and II buildings. The Montoyer project, too, should be examined. No explanation has been given to date as to why the person formerly responsible for infrastructure appears to have withdrawn his statement as authorising officer by subdelegation for the financial year 2004. It needs also to be explained to us why I as rapporteur was not informed of this, and it needs to be made clear to us how the date of theoretical acceptance was established. Should the damages claimed from the construction company have perhaps been higher? What is more, the Committee of the Regions\u2019 internal auditor was refused access to the documents he had requested in this connection. There are strong reasons also for awaiting the outcome of the Court of Auditors\u2019 ongoing investigation into the matter before we grant discharge.\nI also wish to take this opportunity to inform the Chamber of the odd way in which the Committee of the Regions has been treated by the Committee on Budgetary Control. I had received information from a variety of sources indicating that there was much more to be criticised in the Committee of the Regions\u2019 area of financial responsibility than the Committee itself had provided information about. I therefore obtained the Committee on Budgetary Control\u2019s agreement to our questioning OLAF\u2019s investigators and the Committee of the Regions\u2019 internal auditors for 2004 behind closed doors. The meeting was scheduled for the morning of Tuesday, 21\u00a0March 2006. The Committee on Budgetary Control met at 3\u00a0p.m. on the day before this and began by approving the agenda, whereupon a majority suddenly demanded that the questioning scheduled for the following morning should be cancelled.\nA majority of members of the Committee on Budgetary Control refused, then, to study information that I, as rapporteur, considered to be of vital importance in adopting a position on the discharge issue. I did not find out why. I maintain that if the EU\u2019s financial interests are to be protected, the committee needs to take on board all the relevant information on such issues. The majority of the Committee refused to study the information and then voted in favour of our proposing to Parliament that discharge be granted right now, in spite of the fact that I as rapporteur maintain that we should await the outcome of ongoing investigations by OLAF and the Court of Auditors.\nI understand that the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control have now had the opportunity to study documents indicating various irregularities. If Parliament still grants discharge, it will not then be possible subsequently to plead ignorance. Comparison might be made with what is now happening regarding the granting of discharge to the President in the light of the rents in Strasbourg.\nOn this subject, Parliament is coming to the conclusion that new information has come to light that must be studied before a decision on discharge is taken. There is an exact parallel with the situation regarding the Committee of the Regions. The only difference is that the Strasbourg issue has found its way into the media. Do newspaper articles have to appear before there is a response from Members of the European Parliament? Should it not be obvious that Members will decide to vote against granting discharge to the Committee of the Regions until such time as all the uncertainties have been clarified?\nI therefore appeal to all Members carefully to consider what they are voting on tomorrow. Because we have not had all the uncertainties clarified, I would call on you to vote against granting discharge for the Committee of the Regions\u2019 implementation of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2004. If there is a vote on the report, I would call on you to vote in favour of the amendments tabled by Mr\u00a0Staes and myself with a view to obtaining the facts of the case. That is what we must do if we take seriously the demand for accountability, which is at the heart of the democratic process.", "lang": "SV", "original": "Nils Lundgren (IND/DEM), f\u00f6redragande . \u2013 Herr talman!

Regionkommitt\u00e9n har flest anm\u00e4rkningar fr\u00e5n revisionsr\u00e4tten av de granskade \u201d\u00d6vriga institutioner\u201d. Internrevisionen sk\u00f6ttes under 2004 i praktiken av enbart en, dessutom tillf\u00e4lligt anst\u00e4lld, internrevisor. En internrevisor som \u00e4r beroende av st\u00e4ndigt f\u00f6rnyat anst\u00e4llningskontrakt m\u00e5ste ha mycket sv\u00e5rt att uppr\u00e4tth\u00e5lla sitt oberoende fr\u00e5n ledningen. Det \u00e4r of\u00f6rsvarligt att Regionkommitt\u00e9n allts\u00e5 inte hade en fungerande internrevision under 2004, trots den skarpa kritik som parlamentet tidigare framf\u00f6rt betr\u00e4ffande 2003. Vi har fortfarande inte f\u00e5tt n\u00e5gon f\u00f6rklaring till att den internrevisor som verkade fram till i maj 2004 inte var i st\u00e5nd att l\u00e4gga fram n\u00e5gra revisionsrapporter.\nDet p\u00e5g\u00e5r vidare en OLAF-utredning av Regionkommitt\u00e9n avseende \u00f6verf\u00f6ring av personalers\u00e4ttningar med till\u00e4mpning av en korrigeringskoefficient. \u00d6verf\u00f6ringar har beviljats utan att de grundats p\u00e5 bel\u00e4gg f\u00f6r att det f\u00f6rel\u00e5g r\u00e4tt till s\u00e5dana \u00f6verf\u00f6ringar. Det framst\u00e5r som uppenbart att detta borde ha uppt\u00e4ckts av Regionkommitt\u00e9n redan under 2004 och att dessa utbetalningar d\u00e5 borde ha stoppats. Trots detta uppger ledningen att det inte har varit fr\u00e5ga om n\u00e5gra fall av bedr\u00e4gerier. Inte heller i fr\u00e5ga om detta har det getts n\u00e5gra tydliga besked om att \u00e5tg\u00e4rder har vidtagits f\u00f6r att \u00e5terkr\u00e4va oriktiga \u00f6verf\u00f6ringar. L\u00e4get f\u00f6rv\u00e4rras av att dessa utbetalningar avsett personer som innehar nyckelpositioner inom administrationen. Olika slag av oegentligheter har varit n\u00e5got av Regionkommitt\u00e9ns signum under de senaste \u00e5ren, vilket pekar p\u00e5 att den utlovade kulturf\u00f6r\u00e4ndringen inom organisationen inte har \u00e4gt rum. Som det ser ut nu kommer OLAF med sin slutrapport i mitten av maj. Det vore oansvarigt att bevilja ansvarsfrihet innan vi vet resultatet av denna utredning.\nRegionkommitt\u00e9ns omorganisation har i flera fall inneburit att personer inblandade i misst\u00e4nkta oegentligheter befordras, vilket ocks\u00e5 \u00e4r regelvidrigt.\nRevisionsr\u00e4ttens granskning av Belliard I och II-byggnaderna p\u00e5g\u00e5r fortfarande. \u00c4ven Montoyerprojektet borde granskas. Hittills har ingen f\u00f6rklaring getts till varf\u00f6r den f.d. chefen f\u00f6r infrastrukturen verkar ha dragit tillbaka sin f\u00f6rklaring som vidaredelegerad utanordnare f\u00f6r budget\u00e5ret 2004.

Kanske skulle det skadest\u00e5nd som \u00e5lagts byggfirman ha varit h\u00f6gre? Dessutom f\u00f6rv\u00e4grades Regionkommitt\u00e9ns internrevisor tillg\u00e5ng till de handlingar som han hade beg\u00e4rt avseende detta.

Jag har inte f\u00e5tt veta varf\u00f6r. Jag h\u00e4vdar att skyddet av EU:s ekonomiska intressen kr\u00e4ver att utskottet tar till sig all relevant information i s\u00e5dana fr\u00e5gor. Utskottets majoritet v\u00e4grade att ta del av informationen och r\u00f6stade sedan f\u00f6r att vi skulle f\u00f6resl\u00e5 parlamentet att bevilja ansvarsfrihet redan nu, trots att jag som f\u00f6redragande h\u00e4vdar att vi b\u00f6r avvakta resultatet av p\u00e5g\u00e5ende utredningar i OLAF och revisionsr\u00e4tten.\nJag har f\u00f6rst\u00e5tt att ledam\u00f6terna i budgetkontrollutskottet nu har haft m\u00f6jlighet att ta del av dokument som p\u00e5visar olika oegentligheter. Om parlamentet \u00e4nd\u00e5 beviljar ansvarsfrihet, kan man s\u00e5ledes inte efter\u00e5t s\u00e4ga att man inget visste.

This lack of confidence in the EU is, unfortunately, well deserved. The EU does not demonstrate a convincing resolve to clamp down on irregularities, fraud and the abuse of power in its institutions. In practice, there is little readiness to demand accountability. The instinct is to cover things up. Whistle-blowers lose their jobs instead of receiving praise. Cheating and scandals are not investigated, and no legal proceedings are brought in connection with those that are. Discharge is granted in spite of the fact that we do not know if everything has proceeded correctly.\nA majority of this Chamber appears to want to conceal unpleasant truths about the European Union from people so that the EU does not become still more unpopular. That is a deeply undemocratic attitude. Our task is to elicit the truth and to demand accountability on our citizens\u2019 behalf, not to conceal the truth from them.\nAs rapporteur for the Committee on Budgetary Control, it was my job to work on the issue of granting discharge to \u2018Other Institutions\u2019, of which there are seven in total. I have found no reason for bringing the Ombudsman and the Data Protection Supervisor into question. Four of the remaining five institutions are open to criticism, but not of so serious a character that there is reason for questioning whether discharge should be granted. The Council, the European Court of Justice, the Court of Auditors and the European Economic and Social Committee are in this position. Where the Committee of the Regions is concerned, however, I find that further investigations are required before we can take a decision on the issue of granting discharge.\nIn the course of 2004, the European Economic and Social Committee had problems involving irregularities in relation to the reimbursement of members\u2019 travelling expenses. We hope that this problem is now in the past. There have been problems with the Belliard\u00a0I and\u00a0II buildings, and I expect a full account of these in the Court of Auditors\u2019 forthcoming report.\nWhere the Council is concerned, many of the risks are to be found, as usual, in administrative activities relating to the building projects in which the Council is involved. I want to take this opportunity to emphasise the advantages of renting buildings instead of engaging in such huge building projects ourselves. It would also be helpful if the Council were to come up with clearer definitions of, respectively, administrative and operational expenses.\nThe European Court of Justice\u2019s internal audits were far from satisfactory during 2004. Its internal auditor also acted as the head of the ex-ante verification unit, which is quite simply unacceptable. Moreover, the internal auditor has not completed any of his investigations since he was appointed in 2003. Parliament expects to see energetic measures and strong improvements in this area.\nThe European Court of Justice\u2019s massive building projects at present under way cannot be anything other than a cause of disquiet. It is therefore essential that a complete and detailed progress report on this project be made to the Committee on Budgetary Control.\nThe fact that the Court does not at present require judges to declare their financial interests is unacceptable. Irrespective of whether or not there is at present any legal requirement for them to do so, the Court must prepare its own binding rules in this area. Regarding the use of official cars, Parliament again calls on the Court not to allow these to be used for private purposes.\nWhere the Court of Auditors is concerned, the fact that a handful of large Luxembourg-based accounting firms are in a dominant position when it comes to scrutinising the Court\u2019s accounts is worrying, although Parliament appreciates that it is difficult for the Court to avoid this situation. It is therefore extremely important for there to be an open, fair and comprehensible tendering procedure.\nThe Court of Auditors has problems with its organisational structure, which is in need of reform. This is something that needs to be got to grips with in the ongoing evaluation preparatory to overhauling the organisation of the Court, preferably in accordance with the proposal for reform devised by the British House of Lords.\nAgain, Parliament should call on the Court of Auditors not to permit the use of official cars for private purposes.\nI turn now to our black sheep, namely the Committee of the Regions which, of the \u2018Other Institutions\u2019 examined, has attracted the most criticism from the Court of Auditors. During 2004, the internal audit was in practice carried out by a single internal auditor, and a temporary one at that. An internal auditor dependent on a constantly renewable employment contract must find it very difficult to maintain his or her independence from the management of the organisation concerned. It is indefensible that the Committee of the Regions should not, then, have had a proper internal audit carried out during 2004, in spite of Parliament\u2019s robust criticism of that institution in relation to 2003. We have still not received any explanation of the fact that the internal auditor employed up until May 2004 was in no position to produce any auditor\u2019s reports.\nThere continues an OLAF investigation into the Committee of the Regions in connection with its reimbursement of members\u2019 expenses, to which a correction coefficient was applied. Payments for which there was no underlying proof of entitlement had been granted. It seems obvious that this should have been discovered by the Committee of the Regions no later than in the course of 2004 and that these payments should then have been stopped. In spite of this, the Committee\u2019s managers state that there is no question of there having been any cases of fraud. In connection with this matter, no clear information has been given, either, of measures having been taken to claim back incorrect payments. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that these payments were to people in key positions within the administration. In recent years, the Committee of the Regions has been partly characterised by irregularities of various kinds, showing that the promised culture change within the organisation has not taken place. It now looks as if OLAF will produce its final report in the middle of May. It would be irresponsible to grant discharge before we know the results of this investigation.\nThe reorganisation of the Committee of the Regions has in several cases meant that people involved in suspected irregularities have been promoted, which is also irregular.\nThe Court of Auditors is continuing with its investigation in connection with the Belliard\u00a0I and II buildings. The Montoyer project, too, should be examined. No explanation has been given to date as to why the person formerly responsible for infrastructure appears to have withdrawn his statement as authorising officer by subdelegation for the financial year 2004. It needs also to be explained to us why I as rapporteur was not informed of this, and it needs to be made clear to us how the date of theoretical acceptance was established. Should the damages claimed from the construction company have perhaps been higher? What is more, the Committee of the Regions\u2019 internal auditor was refused access to the documents he had requested in this connection. There are strong reasons also for awaiting the outcome of the Court of Auditors\u2019 ongoing investigation into the matter before we grant discharge.\nI also wish to take this opportunity to inform the Chamber of the odd way in which the Committee of the Regions has been treated by the Committee on Budgetary Control. I had received information from a variety of sources indicating that there was much more to be criticised in the Committee of the Regions\u2019 area of financial responsibility than the Committee itself had provided information about. I therefore obtained the Committee on Budgetary Control\u2019s agreement to our questioning OLAF\u2019s investigators and the Committee of the Regions\u2019 internal auditors for 2004 behind closed doors. The meeting was scheduled for the morning of Tuesday, 21\u00a0March 2006. The Committee on Budgetary Control met at 3\u00a0p.m. on the day before this and began by approving the agenda, whereupon a majority suddenly demanded that the questioning scheduled for the following morning should be cancelled.\nA majority of members of the Committee on Budgetary Control refused, then, to study information that I, as rapporteur, considered to be of vital importance in adopting a position on the discharge issue. I did not find out why. I maintain that if the EU\u2019s financial interests are to be protected, the committee needs to take on board all the relevant information on such issues. The majority of the Committee refused to study the information and then voted in favour of our proposing to Parliament that discharge be granted right now, in spite of the fact that I as rapporteur maintain that we should await the outcome of ongoing investigations by OLAF and the Court of Auditors.\nI understand that the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control have now had the opportunity to study documents indicating various irregularities. If Parliament still grants discharge, it will not then be possible subsequently to plead ignorance. Comparison might be made with what is now happening regarding the granting of discharge to the President in the light of the rents in Strasbourg.\nOn this subject, Parliament is coming to the conclusion that new information has come to light that must be studied before a decision on discharge is taken. There is an exact parallel with the situation regarding the Committee of the Regions. The only difference is that the Strasbourg issue has found its way into the media. Do newspaper articles have to appear before there is a response from Members of the European Parliament? Should it not be obvious that Members will decide to vote against granting discharge to the Committee of the Regions until such time as all the uncertainties have been clarified?\nI therefore appeal to all Members carefully to consider what they are voting on tomorrow. Because we have not had all the uncertainties clarified, I would call on you to vote against granting discharge for the Committee of the Regions\u2019 implementation of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2004. If there is a vote on the report, I would call on you to vote in favour of the amendments tabled by Mr\u00a0Staes and myself with a view to obtaining the facts of the case. That is what we must do if we take seriously the demand for accountability, which is at the heart of the democratic process."}, {"speaker": "Rodi \u039aratsa-\u03a4sagaropoulou (PPE-DE),", "english": "Rodi \u039aratsa-\u03a4sagaropoulou (PPE-DE), rapporteur. \u2013 (EL) Mr President, Commissioner, as rapporteur on the discharge for the European Development Funds, I wish to start by saying that these funds are an important and valuable tool for promoting solidarity, prosperity in the world, peace, the principles of justice and respect for human rights.\nThe Committee on Budgetary Control examines the implementation of these budgets of these funds and formulates its opinion on optimum administration with efficiency and transparency.\nAs far as the sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth Funds for the financial year 2004 are concerned, taking account of the report by the Court of Auditors and our exchange of views with the Commission and the Commissioner himself, Mr\u00a0Louis\u00a0Michel, we propose discharge to the Commission. We also propose approval of the closing of the accounts of these funds for 2004.\nThe motion for a resolution proposed by our committee to plenary emphasises the importance of the European Development Funds to the European Union's contribution to achieving the Millennium Development Goals, with the primary objective of eradicating poverty. We express our concern at the fact that only EUR 12\u00a0million (0.4% of the budget) is earmarked for basic education and EUR 74 million (just 2.7%) for basic health, despite the recommendations made by the European Parliament in last year's resolution.\nIt is very important for us to promote the principles of democratisation, good governance and equal opportunities through the European Development Funds in order to achieve a double objective: firstly, the sustainable development of countries which benefit and, secondly, the more effective take-up of resources; this is incumbent upon the European Parliament as the House of elected representatives of European citizens.\nThese objectives concern both the European institutions and decentralised services in ACP countries which benefit from the funds and the national administration authorities and the parliaments of these countries.\nAnother matter we refer to is that, as regards the funds managed by the European Investment Bank, which are not audited by the Court of Auditors or controlled by the European Parliament within the framework of the discharge procedure, we consider that it would enhance transparency and efficiency if information were provided and included in the reports of the European Investment Bank on the European Development Funds.\nWe also consider that the budgetisation of these funds would remove many of the complications and the management cost, and the implementation of successive funds will help to speed up disbursement and eliminate the relevant democratic deficit.\nWe are also concerned about the sum which remains for clearance. It must be reduced by promoting flexible actions and with faster results.\nFinally, we wish to enhance the visibility of the European Union's external action. European citizens are proud of this policy of solidarity and citizens of the developing world covet and need it. It is time for our political objectives and effective methods to be combined with better communication and visibility both as regards our actions as independent actions and within the framework of international organisations, at the UN, the World Bank and other bodies.", "lang": "EL", "original": "\u03a1\u03cc\u03b4\u03b7

We also propose approval of the closing of the accounts of these funds for 2004.\nThe motion for a resolution proposed by our committee to plenary emphasises the importance of the European Development Funds to the European Union's contribution to achieving the Millennium Development Goals, with the primary objective of eradicating poverty. We express our concern at the fact that only EUR 12\u00a0million (0.4% of the budget) is earmarked for basic education and EUR 74 million (just 2.7%) for basic health, despite the recommendations made by the European Parliament in last year's resolution.\nIt is very important for us to promote the principles of democratisation, good governance and equal opportunities through the European Development Funds in order to achieve a double objective: firstly, the sustainable development of countries which benefit and, secondly, the more effective take-up of resources; this is incumbent upon the European Parliament as the House of elected representatives of European citizens.\nThese objectives concern both the European institutions and decentralised services in ACP countries which benefit from the funds and the national administration authorities and the parliaments of these countries.\nAnother matter we refer to is that, as regards the funds managed by the European Investment Bank, which are not audited by the Court of Auditors or controlled by the European Parliament within the framework of the discharge procedure, we consider that it would enhance transparency and efficiency if information were provided and included in the reports of the European Investment Bank on the European Development Funds.\nWe also consider that the budgetisation of these funds would remove many of the complications and the management cost, and the implementation of successive funds will help to speed up disbursement and eliminate the relevant democratic deficit.\nWe are also concerned about the sum which remains for clearance. It must be reduced by promoting flexible actions and with faster results.\nFinally, we wish to enhance the visibility of the European Union's external action. European citizens are proud of this policy of solidarity and citizens of the developing world covet and need it. It is time for our political objectives and effective methods to be combined with better communication and visibility both as regards our actions as independent actions and within the framework of international organisations, at the UN, the World Bank and other bodies."}, {"speaker": "President.", "english": "President. \u2013 The debate is closed.\nThe vote will take place on Thursday at 11 a.m.\n(The sitting was suspended at 8.15 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)", "lang": "EN", "original": "President. \u2013 The debate is closed.\nThe vote will take place on Thursday at 11 a.m.\n(The sitting was suspended at 8.15 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)", "agenda_item": "Discharges for the implementation of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2004 (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060426-ITEM-015", "intervention_id": "3-164", "summary_english": "```json\n{\n  \"headline\": \"\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"\",\n  \"positionSum\": \"\",\n  \"argSum\": \"\",\n  \"propSum\": \"\",\n  \"quotes\": []\n}\n```", "summary_original": "```json\n{\n  \"headline\": \"\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"\",\n  \"positionSum\": \"\",\n  \"argSum\": \"\",\n  \"propSum\": \"\",\n  \"quotes\": []\n}\n```", "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "method": "structured", "formatted_summary": "President. \u2013 The debate is closed.\nThe vote will take place on Thursday at 11 a.m.\n(The sitting was suspended at 8.15 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)"}, {"speaker": "IN THE CHAIR: MR FRIEDRICH", "english": "IN THE CHAIR: MR FRIEDRICH Vice-President", "lang": "EN", "original": "IN THE CHAIR: MR FRIEDRICH Vice-President", "agenda_item": "Discharges for the implementation of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2004 (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060426-ITEM-015", "intervention_id": "3-165", "summary_english": "```json\n{\n  \"headline\": \"\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"\",\n  \"positionSum\": \"\",\n  \"argSum\": \"\",\n  \"propSum\": \"\",\n  \"quotes\": []\n}\n```", "summary_original": "```json\n{\n  \"headline\": \"\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"\",\n  \"positionSum\": \"\",\n  \"argSum\": \"\",\n  \"propSum\": \"\",\n  \"quotes\": []\n}\n```", "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "method": "structured", "formatted_summary": "IN THE CHAIR: MR FRIEDRICH Vice-President"}, {"speaker": "President.", "english": "President.

The next item is the continuation of the joint debate on the discharges for the implementation of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2004."}, {"speaker": "Umberto Guidoni (GUE/NGL),", "english": "Umberto Guidoni (GUE/NGL), rapporteur. \u2013 (IT) Mr\u00a0President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has the important task of granting discharge for the financial year 2004 to 14 European agencies that are fully, partially or indirectly subsidised by the European Union. I shall not dwell here on the specific details or the problems that were found in each individual agency; I shall confine myself to mentioning those items that have emerged as the main points for a joint debate.\nI take this opportunity to highlight what I have just said, which is that discharge is given to just 14 out of the 27 agencies that exist. Indeed, I wonder how many of you are actually up to date with how many such bodies there are and what their real functions are: not many of you, ladies and gentlemen, and I am sure that very few European citizens have any clear ideas on the subject. It might therefore be worth developing information campaigns for them about the agencies and their functions.\nIt is no coincidence that, after the debate on my report in committee, a study was commissioned \u2013 it is still under way \u2013 to analyse and clarify the situations of the European agencies. The study is revealing what has already emerged from the report, namely a lack of harmonisation among the various agencies, and the likelihood of poor transparency associated with difficulties in Parliament\u2019s control over them.\nTo that end, I have called on the Council in my report to start talks as soon as possible to conclude the draft interinstitutional agreement, which the Commission put forward at Parliament\u2019s request. In the discharge report on the agencies for 2003, Parliament actually called for this institutional agreement to be set up in order to place all the agencies within a common regulatory framework.\nWith regard to Parliament\u2019s powers to grant discharge, I have tried to underline the unfairness of the current situation and would recall that, under Article 185 of the Financial Regulation, Parliament gives discharge for the implementation of the budgets of the bodies set up by the Communities that have legal personality and actually receive grants charged to the budget.\nIn reality, it is important to note that not all of these bodies are fully or even partially funded via grants charged to the budget. The conclusion may therefore be drawn that the discharge decision covers both the budget and the non-budget funding of these bodies. The situation is clearly unacceptable, and it implies that some of the bodies set up by the Union are accountable for the way they spend income received from sources other than the budget, whilst others, which do not receive a subsidy from the budget, are not.\nAn amendment to the Financial Regulation that was proposed by me and adopted by the Committee on Budgetary Control has introduced this very principle. If the Regulation thus amended is adopted, Parliament will see its powers of control greatly expanded in the coming years, to the benefit of the principles of transparency and democracy.\nThe analyses carried out by the Court of Auditors were of great help in drawing up the reports. They revealed a few irregularities of very little significance, and I therefore endorse the decision of the Court of Auditors, which proposes granting discharge to the directors of all 14 agencies analysed. I am sorry to say, however, that the analysis that the Court was asked to provide is purely technical in nature, and there has been no control of the ways in which the allocated budget has been spent during the current year.\nI have stressed this point in the working document accompanying the reports, where I propose that in subsequent years the Court of Auditors should supplement the current assessment with an evaluation of service quality, competences and activities: in other words how efficiently the individual agencies spend their budgets.\nMany of the issues that have come up are recurrent, and we can therefore talk of a cross-cutting analysis of issues that have emerged across the various agencies. One such issue concerns the Financial Regulation, which was devised for the agencies, while the subsequent financial regulations specific to each agency were designed to adhere as closely as possible to the general Financial Regulation created by the Commission.\nAlthough this criterion is generally valid, it is sometimes not suited to the smallest agencies, for which appropriate reforms will be needed. That is one of the main objections made by the Court of Auditors. Personnel selection problems are also common to several agencies, since the agencies certainly require greater assistance than larger institutions. I therefore think it is important that the Commission should make the services of EPSO, the Commission\u2019s Directorate-General for Personnel Selection, available to them, as well as supplying other cross-cutting services such as training and the legal service.\nAnother problem concerns internal audits, which for some agencies are an excessive burden. I therefore believe the Commission should table a report on the current situation, describing both each agency\u2019s current capacity for performing an internal audit and the internal audit services that the Commission can make available to the smallest agencies.\nLastly, I shall focus on an issue that has generated heated debate and has marked a divergence in thinking between Parliament and the Commission. The issue concerns the European Agency for Reconstruction, which was set up in 2000 to provide assistance for reconstruction, development and stability in the regions of Kosovo, Serbia, Montenegro and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia through the CARDS programme. Since the programme has come to an end, the Commission has decided to close the Agency by the end of 2008.\nIn view of the excellent work it has done in recent years, and in order to prevent the precious experience built up over many years of activity from being lost, I have in my report proposed extending its mandate so as to be able to use the agency to provide reconstruction assistance wherever required, for example in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, or even the countries recently affected by the tsunami. This would be in addition to the immediate humanitarian assistance provided by ECHO, the Commission\u2019s department set up to help in the event of natural disasters or armed conflict in regions outside the EU. Well, then, I think that is more or less what there was to say about the report, which I hope will be adopted during the next sitting.", "lang": "IT", "original": "Umberto Guidoni (GUE/NGL), relatore . \u2013 Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, signor Commissario, al Parlamento europeo spetta l\u2019importante funzione di concedere il discarico per l\u2019esercizio del bilancio 2004 di 14 agenzie europee che dall\u2019Unione europea ricevono sovvenzioni totali, parziali o indirette. Non mi soffermer\u00f2 in questa sede sulle particolarit\u00e0 e sui problemi riscontrati in ogni singola agenzia, mi limiter\u00f2 a evidenziare gli elementi emersi come principali punti di discussione comune.\nColgo l\u2019occasione per evidenziare quanto ho appena detto, cio\u00e8 che il discarico \u00e8 effettuato soltanto su 14 agenzie rispetto alle 27 esistenti. Mi chiedo infatti, quanti di voi siano effettivamente al corrente del numero e delle reali funzioni di questi organismi; non sono molti, onorevoli colleghi, e sicuramente sono pochissimi i cittadini europei che hanno le idee chiare in proposito e per i quali sarebbe forse il caso di sviluppare programmi di informazione sul tema delle agenzie e delle loro funzioni.\nNon per nulla, dopo la discussione sulla mia relazione in commissione, \u00e8 stato commissionato uno studio, tuttora in corso, per analizzare e chiarire le situazioni delle agenzie europee. Lo studio sta evidenziando quanto gi\u00e0 emerso dalla relazione, ovvero la mancanza di armonizzazione tra le diverse agenzie e il rischio di scarsa trasparenza legata alle difficolt\u00e0 di controllo da parte del Parlamento.\nA tale scopo nella relazione ho invitato il Consiglio ad avviare quanto prima i negoziati per la conclusione della proposta di accordo interistituzionale, presentata dalla Commissione su richiesta del Parlamento, il quale, nella relazione di discarico 2003 sulle agenzie, ha chiesto appunto di avviare questo accordo istituzionale al fine di inserire in un comune quadro regolamentare tutte le agenzie.\nIn merito ai poteri di discarico del Parlamento ho inteso sottolineare l\u2019iniquit\u00e0 dell\u2019attuale situazione, rammentando che ai sensi dell\u2019articolo 185 del regolamento finanziario il Parlamento concede il discarico per l\u2019esecuzione del bilancio degli organi istituiti dalla Comunit\u00e0, dotati di personalit\u00e0 giuridica e che ricevono effettivamente sovvenzioni a carico del bilancio.\nIn realt\u00e0, \u00e8 importante rilevare che non tutti questi organi sono integralmente o anche parzialmente finanziati attraverso sovvenzioni a carico del bilancio, si pu\u00f2 quindi concludere osservando che la decisione sul discarico riguarda sia il finanziamento a carico del bilancio, sia altre forme di finanziamento di tali organi. Chiaramente la situazione \u00e8 inaccettabile ed implica che alcuni organi istituiti dall\u2019Unione debbano rendere conto del modo in cui spendono i finanziamenti provenienti da fonti diverse di bilancio, mentre altri, che non percepiscono la sovvenzione a carico del bilancio, non sono tenuti a farlo.\nUn emendamento, da me proposto al regolamento finanziario ed approvato nella commissione per il controllo dei bilanci, ha introdotto esattamente questo principio: se il regolamento cos\u00ec emendato sar\u00e0 approvato, negli anni a venire il Parlamento vedr\u00e0 grandemente ampliati i propri poteri di controllo, a beneficio dei principi di trasparenza e di democrazia.\nNello svolgimento della relazione, un grande aiuto \u00e8 venuto dalle analisi effettuate dalla Corte dei conti, le quali hanno evidenziato alcune irregolarit\u00e0, di scarsissima rilevanza e per questo mi associo nel giudizio della Corte dei conti, la quale ha proposto di concedere il discarico ai direttori di tutte le 14 agenzie analizzate. Dispiace per\u00f2 rilevare che l\u2019analisi richiesta alla Corte \u00e8 di natura puramente tecnica, mentre nessun controllo viene effettuato sulle modalit\u00e0 in cui il bilancio assegnato \u00e8 stato speso nell\u2019anno in corso.\nNel documento di lavoro che accompagna le relazioni mi sono soffermato su questo punto; proponendo alla Corte dei conti, per gli anni a seguire, di integrare l\u2019attuale valutazione con una verifica della qualit\u00e0 dei servizi, delle competenze, delle attivit\u00e0, ovvero dell\u2019efficienza del modo in cui il bilancio viene speso dalle singole agenzie.\nMolti dei problemi rilevati sono ricorrenti e quindi parliamo di un\u2019analisi orizzontale dei problemi emersi a livello orizzontale rispetto alle varie agenzie: uno di questi problemi riguarda il regolamento finanziario, che \u00e8 stato pensato per le agenzie mentre i successivi regolamenti finanziari specifici per ogni agenzia sono stati concepiti per seguire pi\u00f9 strettamente possibile il regolamento finanziario generale creato per la Commissione.\nQuesto criterio, in generale valido, qualche volta non \u00e8 adeguato alle agenzie pi\u00f9 piccole, per le quali sar\u00e0 invece necessario provvedere alle dovute riforme. Questa \u00e8 una delle obiezioni principali formulate dalla Corte dei conti. Pure i problemi relativi alla selezione del personale sono comuni a diverse agenzie; in quanto le agenzie hanno sicuramente bisogno di maggiore assistenza rispetto alle istituzioni pi\u00f9 grandi; ritengo quindi importante che la Commissione metta a disposizione di queste ultime i servizi offerti dall\u2019 EPSO , la Direzione generale della Commissione preposta alla selezione del personale, oltre a fornire altri servizi orizzontali quali la formazione e il servizio giuridico.\nUn altro problema riguarda l\u2019audit interno, che per alcune agenzie risulta eccessivamente gravoso; ritengo quindi utile che la Commissione presenti una relazione sull\u2019attuale situazione, descrivendo sia le capacit\u00e0 di audit interno esistenti presso ogni agenzia, sia i servizi di audit interno che la Commissione \u00e8 in grado di mettere a disposizione delle agenzie pi\u00f9 piccole.\nInfine, mi soffermo su un problema che ha accesso un forte dibattito e ha scandito lo sviluppo di linee di pensiero divergenti fra Parlamento e Commissione, ovvero la questione relativa all\u2019Agenzia europea per la ricostruzione, creata nel 2000 per fornire assistenza alla ricostruzione, allo sviluppo e alla stabilit\u00e0 delle regioni del Kosovo, Serbia, Montenegro e nella ex Repubblica iugoslava di Macedonia attraverso il programma CARDS . Dato che il programma \u00e8 giunto a conclusione, la Commissione ha preso la decisione di chiudere l\u2019Agenzia entro il 2008.\nIn considerazione dell\u2019ottimo lavoro svolto in questi anni e al fine di evitare la perdita di un\u2019esperienza preziosa sviluppata in molti anni d\u2019attivit\u00e0, nella mia relazione ho proposto di estenderne il mandato, onde poter utilizzare l\u2019Agenzia per fornire assistenza alla ricostruzione ovunque questa sia richiesta, ad esempio in Iraq, in Afghanistan, in Pakistan o anche nei paesi che sono stati recentemente colpiti dallo tsunami, in modo da integrare l\u2019intervento umanitario di prima assistenza fornito da ECHO , il dipartimento della Commissione creato per fornire aiuti ai disastri naturali o in caso di conflitti armati nei territori esterni all\u2019Unione. Ecco, credo che questo pi\u00f9 o meno sia quanto c\u2019era da dire sulla relazione, che spero sar\u00e0 votata alla prossima sessione plenaria.", "agenda_item": "Discharges for the implementation of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2004 (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060426-ITEM-015", "intervention_id": "3-167", "summary_english": "```json\n{\n  \"headline\": \"MEP Calls for Greater Transparency and Control Over 14 EU Agencies in 2004 Budget Discharge Process\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"The speaker addresses the discharge process for 14 out of 27 existing EU agencies for 2004, highlighting lack of harmonization among agencies, poor transparency, difficulties in parliamentary control, unfair discharge powers distribution, and the need for better coordination of services like personnel selection and internal audits.

I shall not dwell here on the specific details or the problems that were found in each individual agency; I shall confine myself to mentioning those items that have emerged as the main points for a joint debate.\nI take this opportunity to highlight what I have just said, which is that discharge is given to just 14 out of the 27 agencies that exist. Indeed, I wonder how many of you are actually up to date with how many such bodies there are and what their real functions are: not many of you, ladies and gentlemen, and I am sure that very few European citizens have any clear ideas on the subject. It might therefore be worth developing information campaigns for them about the agencies and their functions.\nIt is no coincidence that, after the debate on my report in committee, a study was commissioned \u2013 it is still under way \u2013 to analyse and clarify the situations of the European agencies. The study is revealing what has already emerged from the report, namely a lack of harmonisation among the various agencies, and the likelihood of poor transparency associated with difficulties in Parliament\u2019s control over them.\nTo that end, I have called on the Council in my report to start talks as soon as possible to conclude the draft interinstitutional agreement, which the Commission put forward at Parliament\u2019s request. In the discharge report on the agencies for 2003, Parliament actually called for this institutional agreement to be set up in order to place all the agencies within a common regulatory framework.\nWith regard to Parliament\u2019s powers to grant discharge, I have tried to underline the unfairness of the current situation and would recall that, under Article 185 of the Financial Regulation, Parliament gives discharge for the implementation of the budgets of the bodies set up by the Communities that have legal personality and actually receive grants charged to the budget.\nIn reality, it is important to note that not all of these bodies are fully or even partially funded via grants charged to the budget. The conclusion may therefore be drawn that the discharge decision covers both the budget and the non-budget funding of these bodies. The situation is clearly unacceptable, and it implies that some of the bodies set up by the Union are accountable for the way they spend income received from sources other than the budget, whilst others, which do not receive a subsidy from the budget, are not.\nAn amendment to the Financial Regulation that was proposed by me and adopted by the Committee on Budgetary Control has introduced this very principle. If the Regulation thus amended is adopted, Parliament will see its powers of control greatly expanded in the coming years, to the benefit of the principles of transparency and democracy.\nThe analyses carried out by the Court of Auditors were of great help in drawing up the reports. They revealed a few irregularities of very little significance, and I therefore endorse the decision of the Court of Auditors, which proposes granting discharge to the directors of all 14 agencies analysed. I am sorry to say, however, that the analysis that the Court was asked to provide is purely technical in nature, and there has been no control of the ways in which the allocated budget has been spent during the current year.\nI have stressed this point in the working document accompanying the reports, where I propose that in subsequent years the Court of Auditors should supplement the current assessment with an evaluation of service quality, competences and activities: in other words how efficiently the individual agencies spend their budgets.\nMany of the issues that have come up are recurrent, and we can therefore talk of a cross-cutting analysis of issues that have emerged across the various agencies. One such issue concerns the Financial Regulation, which was devised for the agencies, while the subsequent financial regulations specific to each agency were designed to adhere as closely as possible to the general Financial Regulation created by the Commission.\nAlthough this criterion is generally valid, it is sometimes not suited to the smallest agencies, for which appropriate reforms will be needed. That is one of the main objections made by the Court of Auditors. Personnel selection problems are also common to several agencies, since the agencies certainly require greater assistance than larger institutions. I therefore think it is important that the Commission should make the services of EPSO, the Commission\u2019s Directorate-General for Personnel Selection, available to them, as well as supplying other cross-cutting services such as training and the legal service.\nAnother problem concerns internal audits, which for some agencies are an excessive burden. I therefore believe the Commission should table a report on the current situation, describing both each agency\u2019s current capacity for performing an internal audit and the internal audit services that the Commission can make available to the smallest agencies.\nLastly, I shall focus on an issue that has generated heated debate and has marked a divergence in thinking between Parliament and the Commission. The issue concerns the European Agency for Reconstruction, which was set up in 2000 to provide assistance for reconstruction, development and stability in the regions of Kosovo, Serbia, Montenegro and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia through the CARDS programme. Since the programme has come to an end, the Commission has decided to close the Agency by the end of 2008.\nIn view of the excellent work it has done in recent years, and in order to prevent the precious experience built up over many years of activity from being lost, I have in my report proposed extending its mandate so as to be able to use the agency to provide reconstruction assistance wherever required, for example in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, or even the countries recently affected by the tsunami. This would be in addition to the immediate humanitarian assistance provided by ECHO, the Commission\u2019s department set up to help in the event of natural disasters or armed conflict in regions outside the EU.

The expenditures that the Court of Auditors approved of represent nearly one third of the European Union\u2019s budget. I am pleased that this progress is also reflected in Parliament\u2019s reports, and that it has been proposed that Parliament should approve the Commission\u2019s implementation of the budget.\nAllow me to express my sincere gratitude to rapporteurs Mr\u00a0Jan\u00a0Mulder, Mrs\u00a0Rodi\u00a0Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou (who examined the European Development Fund) and Mr\u00a0Szabolcs\u00a0Fazakas, Chairman of Parliament\u2019s Committee on Budgetary Control, who have skilfully guided the entire process. Parliament has drawn up an extensive list of recommendations for improvements. The Commission intends to observe most of these, and to report on this as required.\nWe all know that the glass is not yet full, but Parliament supports the plan approved by the Commission in June 2005 to devise an integrated internal control framework, as well as the action plan approved by the Commission in January 2006.\nNow that we know what is missing, let me concentrate on the missing part. Firstly, I applaud Parliament for the text of the inter-institutional agreement, which arose as a result of negotiations held with the Council and for the first time mentions issues of budget control and endorsement.\nWe all know that the implementation of this political agreement will require continued work, and the Commission certainly intends to do its utmost in the achievement of that objective.\nWe also seek to improve the expression of accountability vis-\u00e0-vis the European Parliament and the European taxpayer. We plan to devote a considerable amount of attention to three measures.\nFirstly, we will strengthen the procedure for the preparation of Annual Activity Reports and improve its consistency across General Directorates. We will also make amendments to the Synthesis Report, although not as elaborately as the European Parliament has recommended.\nSecondly, we will enhance transparency in the use of EU funds. Next week the Commission will adopt a Green Paper on the European Transparency Initiative. As part of the paper, the Commission will propose the introduction of an obligation on Member States to publish the list of beneficiaries of EU funds under shared management. To that end, the Commission will establish a centralised web portal.\nThirdly, we will continue to increase the participation of national auditing institutions. Last week, the Commission sent each of these national audit institutions detailed lists of all of the payments made to their respective Member States in 2005, also inviting them to share the results of their audits with the Commission and the Court of Auditors. This is an initial stage of the implementation of our Action Plan, and I know that several national auditing institutions are prepared to verify the sound use of EU funds in their countries. Thus the first steps have been taken in this direction, and I intend to raise this matter at the meeting of the coordinating committee of the European and national audit courts, to be held in Poland at the end of this year.\nHonourable Members, when I appeared before you last year I said that \u2018mobilising and motivating the Member States will not be easy, and the Commission continues to need your support\u2019. I have enjoyed that support in the past year, and I wish to confirm that we, for our part, will do our utmost.

I am pleased that this progress is also reflected in Parliament\u2019s reports, and that it has been proposed that Parliament should approve the Commission\u2019s implementation of the budget.\nAllow me to express my sincere gratitude to rapporteurs Mr\u00a0Jan\u00a0Mulder, Mrs\u00a0Rodi\u00a0Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou (who examined the European Development Fund) and Mr\u00a0Szabolcs\u00a0Fazakas, Chairman of Parliament\u2019s Committee on Budgetary Control, who have skilfully guided the entire process. Parliament has drawn up an extensive list of recommendations for improvements. The Commission intends to observe most of these, and to report on this as required.\nWe all know that the glass is not yet full, but Parliament supports the plan approved by the Commission in June 2005 to devise an integrated internal control framework, as well as the action plan approved by the Commission in January 2006.\nNow that we know what is missing, let me concentrate on the missing part. Firstly, I applaud Parliament for the text of the inter-institutional agreement, which arose as a result of negotiations held with the Council and for the first time mentions issues of budget control and endorsement.\nWe all know that the implementation of this political agreement will require continued work, and the Commission certainly intends to do its utmost in the achievement of that objective.\nWe also seek to improve the expression of accountability vis-\u00e0-vis the European Parliament and the European taxpayer. We plan to devote a considerable amount of attention to three measures.\nFirstly, we will strengthen the procedure for the preparation of Annual Activity Reports and improve its consistency across General Directorates. We will also make amendments to the Synthesis Report, although not as elaborately as the European Parliament has recommended.\nSecondly, we will enhance transparency in the use of EU funds. Next week the Commission will adopt a Green Paper on the European Transparency Initiative. As part of the paper, the Commission will propose the introduction of an obligation on Member States to publish the list of beneficiaries of EU funds under shared management. To that end, the Commission will establish a centralised web portal.\nThirdly, we will continue to increase the participation of national auditing institutions. Last week, the Commission sent each of these national audit institutions detailed lists of all of the payments made to their respective Member States in 2005, also inviting them to share the results of their audits with the Commission and the Court of Auditors. This is an initial stage of the implementation of our Action Plan, and I know that several national auditing institutions are prepared to verify the sound use of EU funds in their countries. Thus the first steps have been taken in this direction, and I intend to raise this matter at the meeting of the coordinating committee of the European and national audit courts, to be held in Poland at the end of this year.\nHonourable Members, when I appeared before you last year I said that \u2018mobilising and motivating the Member States will not be easy, and the Commission continues to need your support\u2019. I have enjoyed that support in the past year, and I wish to confirm that we, for our part, will do our utmost. As a first step, we plan to follow the recommendations you will adopt today.\nThank you for your attention."}, {"speaker": "Danut\u0117 Budreikeit\u0117 (ALDE),", "english": "Danut\u0117 Budreikeit\u0117 (ALDE), rapporteur of the opinion of the Committee on Development . \u2013 (LT) Having evaluated the use of the general budget for the financial year 2004, the Committee on Development holds the opinion that despite the European Commission's efforts, there remain areas where budget use could be improved.

For example, in its latest report on transparency, it stated that 'complex annual administrative procedures for evaluating and selecting TEN-T projects have been established by the Commission and these have not always led to relevant information being available for the evaluation'. In addition, the Court of Auditors recommends that 'the Commission should also develop an explicit methodology for evaluating proposals submitted under TEN-T and publish it in a manual'. This is overdue.\nThe Court of Auditors also criticised the coordination, stating that 'the coordination of the various sources of Community funding for transport infrastructure projects by the various Directorates-General does not allow the Commission to detect all cases of over- or double funding'. In view of the tight budgetary situation, that is unacceptable.\nIn order to eliminate this problem, the Court of Auditors even makes some specific proposals: 'the Commission should establish appropriate legal bases, procedures and tools in order to improve the coordination of transport infrastructure funding and to identify potential cases of over- or double funding. This should be done, where necessary, in cooperation with the Member States'. To that I would add that responsible persons must be appointed at all levels, and consequences must be drawn.\nThere are also deficits with regard to road safety and passengers\u2019 rights. In the case of road safety, only 60% of payment appropriations were used, and only 11% of the payment appropriations were spent on protecting passengers\u2019 rights. That, too, must change in future.\nI should like to conclude by expressing my deep gratitude to the Court of Auditors. I call on the Commission to rectify these problems and accept the proposals, so that the annual tradition of criticism from the Court of Auditors can be broken next year.

For example, in its latest report on transparency, it stated that 'complex annual administrative procedures for evaluating and selecting TEN-T projects have been established by the Commission and these have not always led to relevant information being available for the evaluation'. In addition, the Court of Auditors recommends that 'the Commission should also develop an explicit methodology for evaluating proposals submitted under TEN-T and publish it in a manual'. This is overdue.\nThe Court of Auditors also criticised the coordination, stating that 'the coordination of the various sources of Community funding for transport infrastructure projects by the various Directorates-General does not allow the Commission to detect all cases of over- or double funding'. In view of the tight budgetary situation, that is unacceptable.\nIn order to eliminate this problem, the Court of Auditors even makes some specific proposals: 'the Commission should establish appropriate legal bases, procedures and tools in order to improve the coordination of transport infrastructure funding and to identify potential cases of over- or double funding. This should be done, where necessary, in cooperation with the Member States'. To that I would add that responsible persons must be appointed at all levels, and consequences must be drawn.\nThere are also deficits with regard to road safety and passengers\u2019 rights. In the case of road safety, only 60% of payment appropriations were used, and only 11% of the payment appropriations were spent on protecting passengers\u2019 rights. That, too, must change in future.\nI should like to conclude by expressing my deep gratitude to the Court of Auditors. I call on the Commission to rectify these problems and accept the proposals, so that the annual tradition of criticism from the Court of Auditors can be broken next year. As EMSA states in the annexes, the maritime and aviation safety agencies should in future make better use of their available resources, although the agencies were still new and had certain teething problems in 2004."}, {"speaker": "G\u00e9rard Deprez (ALDE),", "english": "G\u00e9rard Deprez (ALDE), draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. \u2013 (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, I should first like to express my appreciation for the work done by the different rapporteurs and, in particular, by Mr\u00a0Mulder for the general budget and Mr\u00a0Guidoni for the agencies. These are the two reports that directly address the issues that fall under the competence of our Committee.\nFirstly, as regards the general budget of the EU, I welcome the fact that Mr\u00a0Mulder took on board in his report two crucial remarks in my opinion that were adopted by our Committee. The first of these remarks concerns the implementation rate of the budget in the \u2018freedom, security and justice\u2019 area, with particular regard to payments.\nAlthough there was an improvement on 2003, when the rate was as low as 68%, the implementation rate of payments for 2004 remained inadequate at 83% and is clearly below the average rate of budget implementation. This led to a considerable increase in the amount outstanding (RAL) \u2013 from EUR\u00a0160 million to EUR\u00a0238 million. Obviously, the Directorate-General Justice, Freedom and Security must redouble its efforts to improve budget implementation. This will take on even greater importance in the context of the new financial perspective 2007-2013, assuming it is adopted soon by Parliament, as I hope it will be. Over the next seven years, the budgetary resources earmarked for the \u2018freedom, security and justice\u2019 area will be substantially increased, 163% being the biggest increase of any of the categories or sub-categories of the Union's general budget. The management of the Directorate-General Justice, Freedom and Security must be strengthened if it is to do justice to the political priority thus attached to the task of creating a genuine area of freedom, security and justice.\nThe second remark taken on board by the general rapporteur relates to the concerns expressed by the Court of Auditors about the way in which a number of Member States have made use of the European Fund for Refugees and, in particular, about the shortcomings of the national control systems in place. In this sector, as in many other shared management sectors, the Commission is obviously suffering more from the weakness of the Member States than from its own shortcomings. I welcome the fact that our general rapporteur opted to make this problem a key element of his report. The delegation from Parliament at the trialogue to renew the interinstitutional agreement was right to push for more specific commitments from the Council and the Member States as regards the monitoring of funds subject to shared management. Unfortunately, we are aware that the results have not matched our expectations.\nI should like to say a few words about the agencies, of which there are many in the \u2018freedom, security and justice\u2019 area. If one leaves out Europol \u2013 and I should like to take this opportunity, as I do every opportunity, to remind the Chamber of our call to transform this from a merely intergovernmental body, as it is at present, into a Community agency, at the earliest opportunity \u2013 if one leaves out Europol, there are no less than four agencies operating in the \u2018freedom, security and justice\u2019 area, and that does not include the European Police College (CEPOL). These four agencies are the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia, the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, the European Agency for the Management of the External Borders and Eurojust.\nOur rapporteur for the discharge for the implementation of the budget of the agencies, Mr\u00a0Guidoni, is certainly aware that the agencies \u2013 and he said this a moment ago \u2013 are not always well received by some Members and the general public. He wrote in his report, and I quote: \u2018the Community\u2019s agencies do not always have a good image or receive a good press\u2019. He went on to say, and I support him in this regard, that some of them do not deserve this negative image and that it would be appropriate to make EU citizens aware of the fact by using the appropriate channels as often as is necessary to justify the existence of these agencies and to draw attention to their results.\nAs rapporteur for the Committee on Civil Liberties, let me state very clearly that, in my view, and setting aside some justified criticisms of the Vienna agency, the agencies that fall within our sector are well managed. Their work is of high quality, and I do not see what other structures could do a better job of performing the specific tasks accorded to the existing agencies. This is true, for example, of the Frontex agency for the control of external borders and Eurojust for the improvement of judicial cooperation. I also wish to take this opportunity to announce \u2013 although I am jumping the gun, ahead of another debate \u2013 that I shall be tabling proposals to strengthen the agencies in question within the framework of the 2007 budget.", "lang": "FR", "original": "G\u00e9rard Deprez (ALDE), rapporteur pour avis de la commission des libert\u00e9s civiles, de la justice et des affaires int\u00e9rieures. - Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, chers coll\u00e8gues, en tant que rapporteur pour la commission des libert\u00e9s civiles, de la justice et des affaires int\u00e9rieures, je veux, en tout premier lieu, exprimer mon appr\u00e9ciation du travail qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9 par les diff\u00e9rents rapporteurs, en particulier M.\u00a0Jan Mulder, pour le budget g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, et M.\u00a0Guidoni, pour les agences. Ce sont, en effet, les deux rapports o\u00f9 sont trait\u00e9es directement les mati\u00e8res qui rel\u00e8vent de la comp\u00e9tence de notre commission.\nTout d\u2019abord, en ce qui concerne le budget g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne, j\u2019appr\u00e9cie que M. Mulder ait repris, dans son rapport, deux des remarques essentielles qui \u00e9taient formul\u00e9es dans mon avis et qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9es par notre commission. La premi\u00e8re de ces remarques concerne le taux d\u2019ex\u00e9cution du budget dans le secteur \u00ablibert\u00e9, s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et justice\u00bb en ce qui concerne, en particulier, les paiements.\nBien qu\u2019il soit en am\u00e9lioration par rapport \u00e0 2003, o\u00f9 il n\u2019\u00e9tait que de 68\u00a0%, le taux d\u2019ex\u00e9cution pour les paiements constat\u00e9 en 2004 reste beaucoup trop faible, de l\u2019ordre de 83\u00a0%, et se situe, d\u2019ailleurs, nettement en dessous du taux moyen d\u2019ex\u00e9cution du budget. Il en r\u00e9sulte une augmentation consid\u00e9rable du reste \u00e0 liquider, qui passe \u00e0 160 \u00e0 238 millions d\u2019euros. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9vidence, la direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale JLS doit amplifier ses efforts pour am\u00e9liorer l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du budget. Cela sera d\u2019autant plus n\u00e9cessaire dans le cadre des nouvelles perspectives financi\u00e8res 2007-2013 si, comme je le souhaite, celles-ci sont approuv\u00e9es prochainement par notre Parlement. En effet, au cours des sept prochaines ann\u00e9es, les moyens budg\u00e9taires consacr\u00e9s au secteur \u00ablibert\u00e9, s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et justice\u00bb vont conna\u00eetre une augmentation consid\u00e9rable: 163\u00a0%, soit l\u2019augmentation la plus forte de toutes les cat\u00e9gories ou sous-cat\u00e9gories du budget g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l\u2019Union. Le managment de la direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale JLS doit absolument se renforcer pour \u00eatre \u00e0 la hauteur de la priorit\u00e9 politique qui est ainsi reconnue \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation d\u2019un v\u00e9ritable espace de libert\u00e9, de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et de justice.\nLa deuxi\u00e8me remarque reprise par le rapporteur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral concerne les pr\u00e9occupations formul\u00e9es par la Cour des comptes relativement \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du Fonds europ\u00e9en pour les r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s par certains \u00c9tats membres et, en particulier, aux faiblesses des syst\u00e8mes nationaux de contr\u00f4le mis en place. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9vidence, dans ce secteur, comme dans beaucoup d\u2019autres de la gestion partag\u00e9e, la Commission p\u00e2tit davantage de la faiblesse des \u00c9tats membres que de ses propres lacunes ou insuffisances. Notre rapporteur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral a \u00e9t\u00e9 bien inspir\u00e9 de faire de ce probl\u00e8me un \u00e9l\u00e9ment central de son rapport et la d\u00e9l\u00e9gation de notre Parlement a bien fait, lors du trilogue pour le renouvellement de l\u2019accord institutionnel, d\u2019insister pour obtenir du Conseil et des \u00c9tats membres des engagements plus pr\u00e9cis en mati\u00e8re de contr\u00f4le des fonds soumis au r\u00e9gime de la gestion partag\u00e9e. Malheureusement, nous savons que les r\u00e9sultats n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 la hauteur des attentes que nous avions formul\u00e9es.\nQuelques r\u00e9flexions enfin \u00e0 propos des agences, qui sont particuli\u00e8rement nombreuses dans le secteur \u00ablibert\u00e9, s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et justice\u00bb. Si l\u2019on excepte Europol en effet - j\u2019en profite pour rappeler, comme \u00e0 chaque occasion, notre exigence d\u2019en faire le plus rapidement possible une agence communautaire et non un simple organe intergouvernemental comme c\u2019est le cas actuellement -, si l\u2019on excepte Europol, donc, il n\u2019y a pas moins de quatre autres agences op\u00e9rationnelles dans le secteur \u00ablibert\u00e9, s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et justice\u00bb, et encore, je ne tiens pas compte du Coll\u00e8ge europ\u00e9en de police, le CEPOL. Ces quatre agences sont l\u2019Observatoire europ\u00e9en des ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes racistes et x\u00e9nophobes, l\u2019Observatoire europ\u00e9en des drogues et des toxicomanies, l\u2019Agence europ\u00e9enne pour la gestion de la coop\u00e9ration op\u00e9rationnelle aux fronti\u00e8res et Eurojust.\nNotre rapporteur pour la d\u00e9charge sur l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du budget des agences, M.\u00a0Umberto Guidoni, n\u2019ignore pas que les agences - il l\u2019a d\u2019ailleurs dit tout \u00e0 l\u2019heure - n\u2019ont pas toujours bonne presse aupr\u00e8s de certains coll\u00e8gues ou dans l\u2019opinion publique. Il l\u2019\u00e9crit dans son rapport lorsqu\u2019il constate que, je cite: \u00ables agences communautaires n\u2019ont pas toujours ni bonne image ni bonne presse\u00bb. Mais il ajoute aussit\u00f4t, et je le soutiens \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, que nombre d\u2019entre elles ne m\u00e9ritent pas cette image n\u00e9gative et qu\u2019il convient de le faire savoir aux citoyens de l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne en justifiant, aussi souvent que n\u00e9cessaire et par les moyens appropri\u00e9s, les raisons d\u2019\u00eatre de ces agences et leurs r\u00e9sultats.\nEn tant que rapporteur de la commission des libert\u00e9s publiques, je veux dire ici de mani\u00e8re tr\u00e8s claire qu\u2019\u00e0 mon avis et \u00e0 l\u2019exception, certes, d\u2019un certain nombre de remarques critiques et fond\u00e9es relatives \u00e0 l\u2019agence de Vienne, les agences qui rel\u00e8vent de notre secteur sont bien g\u00e9r\u00e9es, qu\u2019elles fournissent un travail de qualit\u00e9 et que je ne vois pas bien quelles autres structures pourraient \u00eatre mises en place, qui seraient meilleures pour ex\u00e9cuter les missions sp\u00e9cifiques confi\u00e9es aux agences en place.

I would like to remind you that last year, also in April, we voted on the approval of the European Parliament Budget for 2003, where I was the principal rapporteur. And I proposed that the European Parliament should abandon its work in Strasbourg. Today, I am the shadow rapporteur and I would like to remind you, that last year Members of the European Parliament decided to retain three work places and to continue sessions in Strasbourg. Each year, such work or its organisation costs the Community's citizens EUR 200 million. Mr President, do we have the right to be surprised then that Strasbourg city authority is trying to obtain an unrealistically high price for buildings? I do not think so because we encouraged it to take such actions ourselves. The retention of the European Parliament Headquarters in Strasbourg is condemned to continue losing money until we give it up. It is nothing new that there are economic subjects or persons, who commit fraud or even become corrupt. But often they are encouraged to behave in this way by a monopoly situation, illogical laws or political decisions. We ourselves, my fellow Members of Parliament, decided to use the buildings in Strasbourg knowing that they will cost an unjustifiably huge amount of money and will mean losses for the city and its people, as we only use those buildings for a few days a month. This is elementary economic logic. Many times it has been calculated and argued that if another institution were to move into the European Parliament buildings, working all year long, then this would be of more benefit to the city economically and financially. Therefore, we must accept that we all know this, but for some reason we do not want to change the situation. I believe that the people of Strasbourg, like all the other citizens of the Community, have become the hostages of incorrect decisions we have made ourselves. I support the proposal to postpone the approval of the European Parliament budget until we have examined how many more losses the people of Europe have experienced. It is very important to ascertain whether there has been corruption or violations of laws and agreements, but it is far more important, honourable Members of Parliament, to finally make the decision to give up this unjustifiable, shameful waste of European people's money.

I would like to remind you that last year, also in April, we voted on the approval of the European Parliament Budget for 2003, where I was the principal rapporteur. And I proposed that the European Parliament should abandon its work in Strasbourg. Today, I am the shadow rapporteur and I would like to remind you, that last year Members of the European Parliament decided to retain three work places and to continue sessions in Strasbourg. Each year, such work or its organisation costs the Community's citizens EUR 200 million. Mr President, do we have the right to be surprised then that Strasbourg city authority is trying to obtain an unrealistically high price for buildings? I do not think so because we encouraged it to take such actions ourselves. The retention of the European Parliament Headquarters in Strasbourg is condemned to continue losing money until we give it up. It is nothing new that there are economic subjects or persons, who commit fraud or even become corrupt. But often they are encouraged to behave in this way by a monopoly situation, illogical laws or political decisions. We ourselves, my fellow Members of Parliament, decided to use the buildings in Strasbourg knowing that they will cost an unjustifiably huge amount of money and will mean losses for the city and its people, as we only use those buildings for a few days a month. This is elementary economic logic. Many times it has been calculated and argued that if another institution were to move into the European Parliament buildings, working all year long, then this would be of more benefit to the city economically and financially. Therefore, we must accept that we all know this, but for some reason we do not want to change the situation. I believe that the people of Strasbourg, like all the other citizens of the Community, have become the hostages of incorrect decisions we have made ourselves. I support the proposal to postpone the approval of the European Parliament budget until we have examined how many more losses the people of Europe have experienced. It is very important to ascertain whether there has been corruption or violations of laws and agreements, but it is far more important, honourable Members of Parliament, to finally make the decision to give up this unjustifiable, shameful waste of European people's money. We have to work effectively in one place and we must use money where it is most needed."}, {"speaker": "Bart Staes,", "english": "Bart Staes, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . \u2013 (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have three points to make. First of all, I should like to draw your attention to the amendments I have tabled in connection with the Mulder and Guidoni reports on the agency for reconstruction in the former Yugoslavia. When we visited Kosovo with an ad hoc delegation in February, we saw for ourselves the outstanding work that the reconstruction agency had carried out, and we should not simply disregard its expertise. Hence the request, certainly at this crucial juncture when Kosovo is likely to gain independence this year, not to phase out this agency straight away, but to do it gradually and apply the expertise to other conflict areas in the world, including Iraq and Afghanistan.\nSecondly, with regard to Parliament\u2019s discharge, I should like to make a point of underlining Mr\u00a0Ferber\u2019s excellent input. He has produced a sterling report. His draft report was even better than the report that was ultimately voted on by COCOBU, but it has to be said that there are new revelations which need investigating. This means that ultimately, we will need to vote against his report and against the granting of discharge. I would like to make it absolutely clear that this does not detract from Mr\u00a0Ferber\u2019s work or from COCOBU\u2019s observations, but is a clearly precautionary measure in order to give ourselves six months to find out what exactly happened and hopefully, we, along with the city of Strasbourg, the French Government, the administration of this House, and with everyone involved, will be able to draw the conclusions in complete transparency.\nMy third point concerns the Committee of the Regions. I regret the fact that we did not, prior to the vote in committee, have a hearing with two auditors who would have attended at Mr\u00a0Lundgren\u2019s request and who would have put to us any irregularities and possible fraud. Instead, there is now in Parliament\u2019s secret chamber a chunky, confidential document that suggests that something may be amiss.

Vooreerst wil ik de aandacht vragen voor de amendementen die heb ik ingediend op de verslagen-Mulder en -Guidoni met betrekking tot het Bureau voor wederopbouw in het voormalig Joegoslavi\u00eb. Wij hebben met een ad hoc-delegatie in februari Kosova bezocht. We hebben daar gezien dat het Bureau voor wederopbouw puik werk verricht, schitterend werk verricht en we mogen deze expertise niet weggooien. Vandaar de vraag om zeker op een cruciaal tijdstip, als Kosova waarschijnlijk dit jaar onafhankelijk wordt, dit bureau niet versneld af te bouwen, maar geleidelijk af te bouwen en ook om deze expertise te gebruiken in andere conflictregio's in de wereld, Irak, Afghanistan en nog andere regio's.\nHet tweede onderwerp is de kwijting van het Parlement. Ik wil hier het puike werk van collega Markus Ferber onderstrepen. Hij heeft een schitterend verslag afgeleverd. Zijn ontwerpverslag was zelfs nog sterker dan het verslag dat uiteindelijk door COCOBU werd gestemd, maar we moeten vaststellen dat er nieuwe onthullingen zijn. En daar moeten we dus onderzoek naar verrichten. Dat betekent dat wij uiteindelijk tegen zijn verslag zullen moeten stemmen, dat we tegen het verlenen van kwijting zullen moeten stemmen. Ik wil zeer duidelijk zijn, collega's, dat doet geen afbreuk aan het werk van de heer Ferber; dat doet geen afbreuk aan de opmerkingen van de COCOBU, maar dat is een duidelijke maatregel van voorzorg om onszelf zes maanden te gunnen, om ervoor te zorgen dat wij kunnen weten wat er juist is gebeurd en dat we hopelijk in volle transparantie met de stad Straatsburg, met de Franse regering, met de administratie van het Parlement, met iedereen die bij de zaak betrokken is, de conclusies kunnen trekken.\nHet derde thema betreft het Comit\u00e9 van de regio's. Collega's, ik betreur dat we niet v\u00f3\u00f3r de stemming in commissie de hoorzitting hebben gehouden met twee auditoren die de heer Lundgren had gevraagd. Dat waren twee mensen die ons mogelijke onregelmatigheden, mogelijke fraude wilden komen uiteenzetten.

Mulder for et stort omhyggeligt arbejde og lige s\u00e5dan til de \u00f8vrige ordf\u00f8rere. Det er naturligvis beklageligt, at vi igen i \u00e5r st\u00e5r uden en ren revisionserkl\u00e6ring. Som bekendt skulle EU gerne v\u00e6re forbillede for medlemslandene, ikke mindst for de nye lande med nye og upr\u00f8vede administrationer. Jeg tvivler dog p\u00e5, at vi udg\u00f8r et s\u00e6rligt godt forbillede med et s\u00e5 stort problem, som det er, at vi endnu ikke kan freml\u00e6gge en ren revisionserkl\u00e6ring. Jeg er enig med hr. Mulder i hans betragtninger om, at det er utilfredsstillende, at medlemsstaterne ikke er indstillede p\u00e5 at afgive erkl\u00e6ringer om kontrollen af de midler, som de har modtaget. Vi m\u00e5 sikre, at dette bliver bragt p\u00e5 plads.\nDet er jo rigtigt ogs\u00e5, at ansvaret for forvaltningen ikke kan l\u00e6gges p\u00e5 Kommissionen alene, men at ogs\u00e5 R\u00e5det og medlemsstaterne b\u00e6rer et ansvar. Jeg kan i en r\u00e6kke situationer eller en r\u00e6kke tilf\u00e6lde ikke anbefale at give decharge, simpelthen fordi vi giver den decharge i blinde. Vi p\u00e5tager os p\u00e5 nogle omr\u00e5der en opgave, som vi i virkeligheden ikke kan l\u00f8fte. Et bevis p\u00e5 det er situationen omkring Parlamentets regnskab, som beskrevet af hr. Ferber i dag. I g\u00e5r var vi sikre p\u00e5, at alt var i orden, og vi var klar til at give decharge, og i nattens l\u00f8b er vi s\u00e5 blevet klogere.\nDet er jo et rent tilf\u00e6lde, at vi i dag st\u00e5r i en situation, hvor vi m\u00e5 bede om uds\u00e6ttelse af dechargen, fordi vi simpelthen ikke ved nok. Det er jo ganske ejendommeligt, at b\u00e5de Parlamentets administration og vores revision i 25 \u00e5r har overset noget, som - det siger de i hvert fald, at de har - er en h\u00f8jst angribelig betaling til Strasbourg-by. Der er jo i realiteten tale om en mellemhandleranvance til en helt overfl\u00f8dig mellemhandler.

The legitimacy of Parliament\u2019s seat is not in any way called into question today, and in any case this would not fall within the remit of Parliament or its Members.

Un premier point est que, sur les trente agences existantes, quatorze seulement sont soumises \u00e0 notre contr\u00f4le. Il me semble indispensable que les seize autres, dont le budget est \u00e9galement aliment\u00e9 par les contribuables europ\u00e9ens, soient soumises \u00e0 la d\u00e9charge du Parlement.

Ces faits sont constat\u00e9s depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es sans que rien ne soit entrepris concr\u00e8tement. C\u2019est absolument inadmissible.

It must be stressed that the endorsement of their financial accounts only reflects the agencies' financial situation, but in order to comprehensively assess the use of agency funds, an audit of the activities of these agencies must be carried out. After all, the agencies must spend the money appropriately.\nAt the moment, when reading the audit report, it is completely unclear why one agency was able to carry out several checks in places, and another just a few. Why in one agency there is one particular employee ratio involved in administrative and operational activities, and in another agency there is a different one.\nAll of this, in particular the auditors' certification that part of the budget is to be carried over to next year, indicates that the agencies are not managing funds effectively.

After all, the agencies must spend the money appropriately.\nAt the moment, when reading the audit report, it is completely unclear why one agency was able to carry out several checks in places, and another just a few. Why in one agency there is one particular employee ratio involved in administrative and operational activities, and in another agency there is a different one.\nAll of this, in particular the auditors' certification that part of the budget is to be carried over to next year, indicates that the agencies are not managing funds effectively.

We have received a very extensive report from the European Court of Auditors. Over a dozen reports have also been presented in this Chamber concerning the implementation of the 2004 budget. Despite this wealth of material, however, we still know very little about how the budget was actually implemented and how the funds included in it were spent.\nThis is due firstly to the fact that the information in the report from the Court of Auditors has a rather general character, because the Court investigates mainly the compliance of accounting entries, or what is known as \u2018accounting reality\u2019, and that, as life shows, is often at odds with objective reality. Secondly, the post-audit findings of the Court often do not answer the most important questions in terms of evaluating the rational implementation of the budget. Such questions include what funds are spent on, whether the goals set have really been met by means of these funds, whether there have been any misappropriations of funds, and, finally, whether any funds have been wasted. Finding answers to these questions is essential in order to evaluate the implementation of the budget in a matter-of-fact manner.\nThe degree to which this information is needed is illustrated by the findings of the direct audit carried out by auditors of the European Court of Auditors regarding the implementation of the Tacis programme. Almost EUR 7\u00a0billion was spent on this programme between 1991 and 2005. The programme was supposed to provide financial support to European Union partner countries from Eastern Europe and Central Asia undergoing transformations. For example, in 2005 these countries included Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan. With the programme\u2019s help, 29 precisely defined goals were meant to be achieved. Auditors of the Court found that only five were achieved. If the majority of programmes funded under the European Union budget were audited in such a way, we would be able to determine how rationally and effectively EU funds are spent.\nEven such a general audit allowed the European Court of Auditors, for the 11th time in a row I would like to stress, to state that the accounts presented are not free of faults. It would appear, therefore, that the European Union needs a comprehensive system of expenditure auditing, with extensive involvement of the national auditing institutions in the Member States. Only reports prepared under this kind of system would allow the aforementioned questions to be answered, and the conclusions of such audits could help to improve the effectiveness of budget spending in future years.", "lang": "PL", "original": "Zbigniew Krzysztof Ku\u017amiuk (UEN). \u2013 Panie Przewodnicz\u0105cy!

We have received a very extensive report from the European Court of Auditors. Over a dozen reports have also been presented in this Chamber concerning the implementation of the 2004 budget. Despite this wealth of material, however, we still know very little about how the budget was actually implemented and how the funds included in it were spent.\nThis is due firstly to the fact that the information in the report from the Court of Auditors has a rather general character, because the Court investigates mainly the compliance of accounting entries, or what is known as \u2018accounting reality\u2019, and that, as life shows, is often at odds with objective reality. Secondly, the post-audit findings of the Court often do not answer the most important questions in terms of evaluating the rational implementation of the budget. Such questions include what funds are spent on, whether the goals set have really been met by means of these funds, whether there have been any misappropriations of funds, and, finally, whether any funds have been wasted. Finding answers to these questions is essential in order to evaluate the implementation of the budget in a matter-of-fact manner.\nThe degree to which this information is needed is illustrated by the findings of the direct audit carried out by auditors of the European Court of Auditors regarding the implementation of the Tacis programme. Almost EUR 7\u00a0billion was spent on this programme between 1991 and 2005. The programme was supposed to provide financial support to European Union partner countries from Eastern Europe and Central Asia undergoing transformations. For example, in 2005 these countries included Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan. With the programme\u2019s help, 29 precisely defined goals were meant to be achieved. Auditors of the Court found that only five were achieved. If the majority of programmes funded under the European Union budget were audited in such a way, we would be able to determine how rationally and effectively EU funds are spent.\nEven such a general audit allowed the European Court of Auditors, for the 11th time in a row I would like to stress, to state that the accounts presented are not free of faults. It would appear, therefore, that the European Union needs a comprehensive system of expenditure auditing, with extensive involvement of the national auditing institutions in the Member States. Only reports prepared under this kind of system would allow the aforementioned questions to be answered, and the conclusions of such audits could help to improve the effectiveness of budget spending in future years."}, {"speaker": "James Hugh Allister (NI). \u2013", "english": "James Hugh Allister (NI). \u2013 Mr President, whereas there is much to be said about the deficiencies in budgetary discharge here in the EU and within the institutions, I wish to focus on national misuse of EU funding.

As regards the property issue that causes the difficulty, the Committee of the Regions does not have an individual, independent responsibility, and our Parliament would not be consistent or constructive, either, if it criticised one institution for something that the other institution administering the same property, the Economic and Social Committee, is not being criticised for.\nIt is reassuring that due to work of the expert committee of our Parliament and to the partially excellent work of the rapporteur, the irregularities that have been found are already examined by the competent financial authorities.

I believe that a constructive approach would be more expedient: let us value the positive steps taken by the Committee of the Regions in answer to our earlier proposals, appreciate their cooperative attitude and give them a vote of confidence, trusting them to continue their work in a similar spirit, as we are preparing to do just that in respect of all the other institutions.\nI would just like to add, in one final sentence, that my position regarding all the previously debated Strasbourg issues, too, is that our conclusions cannot not be based on feelings, but exclusively on facts.", "lang": "HU", "original": "Edit Herczog (PSE). \u2013 A R\u00e9gi\u00f3k Bizotts\u00e1g\u00e1t illet\u0151en indokoltnak tartom a 2004-es k\u00f6lts\u00e9gvet\u00e9si mentes\u00edt\u00e9s elfogad\u00e1s\u00e1t.

I appreciate the essentially positive and cooperative approach of the Committee of the Regions, manifested in the fact that it did not make any attempts to avoid or minimise its responsibility for the deficiencies uncovered in previous years and in the course of this year. It must be mentioned that some of the irregularities \u2013 namely the delay in appointing the internal auditor \u2013 were due to external factors, and in such cases, the Committee cannot be found responsible. As regards the property issue that causes the difficulty, the Committee of the Regions does not have an individual, independent responsibility, and our Parliament would not be consistent or constructive, either, if it criticised one institution for something that the other institution administering the same property, the Economic and Social Committee, is not being criticised for.\nIt is reassuring that due to work of the expert committee of our Parliament and to the partially excellent work of the rapporteur, the irregularities that have been found are already examined by the competent financial authorities. Under these circumstances, I do not see the necessity or benefit of adjourning the discharge. In the course of the work of the expert committee preceding this debate, we have already debated everything that can be debated within the competence of our institution, and the adjournment would not assist our own work, the work of OLAF or the operation of the Committee of the Regions.\nThe comprehensive report of the Court of Auditors regarding the draft on property management, under preparation, provides us with a definite guarantee. I believe that a constructive approach would be more expedient: let us value the positive steps taken by the Committee of the Regions in answer to our earlier proposals, appreciate their cooperative attitude and give them a vote of confidence, trusting them to continue their work in a similar spirit, as we are preparing to do just that in respect of all the other institutions.\nI would just like to add, in one final sentence, that my position regarding all the previously debated Strasbourg issues, too, is that our conclusions cannot not be based on feelings, but exclusively on facts."}, {"speaker": "Jos\u00e9 Javier Pom\u00e9s Ruiz (PPE-DE). \u2013", "english": "Jos\u00e9 Javier Pom\u00e9s Ruiz (PPE-DE). \u2013 (ES) Mr President, I must begin by protesting at the nocturnal hour at which we are holding this debate and by thanking our Secretary-General, Julian Priestley, for being here.

Dankenswerterweise hat sie im Oktober 2005 unter ihrem Finanzpersonal eine schriftliche Umfrage durchgef\u00fchrt mit dem Ziel, Konten und deren Zeichnungsberechtigte zu identifizieren, und zwar jene Konten, die im direkten oder indirekten Zusammenhang mit Aktivit\u00e4ten der Kommission stehen und bis jetzt unbekannt sind.

Die Konten, die bislang bereits bekannt waren, das sind etwa Mieteinnahmen des inzwischen privatisierten ehemaligen Kommissionssupermarktes \u201eEconomat\u201c in den Gesch\u00e4ftsr\u00e4umen der Kommission in der rue de la Science. Es geht dabei um mehrere Millionen Euro. Mir gibt zu denken, dass der Zugriff auf diese Konten unklar ist, und deswegen fordere ich eine z\u00fcgige Aufkl\u00e4rung, und zwar z\u00fcgiger als bisher von der Kommission vorgenommen.\nViele Fragen sind noch offen, etwa die, warum diese Konten in der Vergangenheit ohne Wissen und Kontrolle der Kommission von Personen gef\u00fchrt wurden, die hierzu offensichtlich nicht erm\u00e4chtigt gewesen w\u00e4ren.

He has made a number of recommendations for improvements in the discharge procedure, starting with an amendment he has tabled that aims to enable the Commission to fine those countries that fail to pay up the agricultural premiums. I would like to hear what the Commission has to say about this. My delegation will, at any rate, be voting in favour of the amendment.\nThe second compelling point in his report is that he wants the finance ministers of the Member States to sign for any spending themselves. This is something that receives our unqualified support. That is the only way of ensuring that the discharge of the European budget will be dealt with adequately, and we have much appreciation for this report for that reason.\nAnother point is Parliament\u2019s discharge and the discussion that has come about surrounding Strasbourg. It is common knowledge that the whole discussion surrounding the European budget in the Netherlands has been greatly influenced by the fact that we still have three locations where Parliament sits or has offices. We are shocked by what has happened in Strasbourg. Once again, this must be cleared up and I am convinced that our rapporteur, Mr\u00a0Ferber, will succeed in this.

Hij heeft een aantal aanbevelingen gegeven waardoor de kwijting beter zou kunnen verlopen. Om te beginnen heeft hij een amendement ingediend om aan de Europese Commissie de mogelijkheid te geven die landen te korten die geen goede uitvoering geven aan de betaling van de landbouwpremies. Ik hoor graag het antwoord van de Commissie daarop. En ik moet zeggen dat mijn delegatie voor het amendement zal stemmen.\nHet tweede sterke punt uit zijn verslag is dat hij wil dat de ministers van Financi\u00ebn van de lidstaten zelf tekenen voor de uitgaven. Wij steunen dat van harte. Dat is de enige wijze om ervoor te zorgen dat wij tot een adequate afhandeling en kwijting van de Europese begroting komen en op dat punt hebben wij ook veel waardering voor zijn verslag.\nEen ander punt is de kwijting van het Parlement en de discussie die ontstaan is rondom Straatsburg. Het is niet onbekend dat de hele discussie rondom de Europese begroting in Nederland sterk is be\u00efnvloed door het feit dat wij nog steeds drie plaatsen hebben waar het Parlement zitting houdt of kantoor houdt. Wij zijn geschokt door wat er in Straatsburg gebeurd is. Nogmaals, het moet opgehelderd worden en ik ben ervan overtuigd dat onze rapporteur Markus Ferber daar ook in zal slagen. Maar dit toont des te meer aan dat wij het enige Parlement in de wereld zijn dat op drie plaatsen kantoren heeft of vergadert. Het enige! En willen wij door de Europese bevolking serieus genomen worden, dan moeten wij naar \u00e9\u00e9n plaats toe.\nAlleen al om die reden is het CDA van mening dat wij geen aankopen moeten doen van gebouwen totdat wij de Raad zo ver hebben dat wij alles op \u00e9\u00e9n plaats onderbrengen. En of dat nu Straatsburg is, Luxemburg of Brussel, laten we daarover discussi\u00ebren. Ik zeg ook niet dat we de enen moeten blameren en de anderen niet, maar dit is wel het moment om die keuze te maken en dat is ook de reden dat wij met betrekking tot het deelverslag van Markus Ferber, het verslag-Mulder inzake de aankoop van een gebouw, van oordeel zijn dat ook al kan het binnen tien jaar terugverdiend worden, het nu niet het goede moment is, omdat we eerst de Raad willen dwingen een besluit te nemen.", "agenda_item": "Discharges for the implementation of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2004 (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060426-ITEM-015", "intervention_id": "3-199", "summary_english": "```json\n{\n  \"headline\": \"Dutch MEP Supports Budget Discharge Improvements While Opposing Real Estate Purchases Until Parliament Consolidates to Single Location\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"The speaker addresses the 2004 EU budget discharge procedure, highlighting issues with agricultural premium collection from member states, accountability of finance ministers, and Parliament's controversial operation across three locations (Strasbourg, Luxembourg, Brussels).

He has made a number of recommendations for improvements in the discharge procedure, starting with an amendment he has tabled that aims to enable the Commission to fine those countries that fail to pay up the agricultural premiums.

That is the only way of ensuring that the discharge of the European budget will be dealt with adequately, and we have much appreciation for this report for that reason.\nAnother point is Parliament\u2019s discharge and the discussion that has come about surrounding Strasbourg. It is common knowledge that the whole discussion surrounding the European budget in the Netherlands has been greatly influenced by the fact that we still have three locations where Parliament sits or has offices.

Debate Information\n\n**Date:** April 26, 2006  \n**Topic:** Discharges for the implementation of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2004  \n**Number of Contributions:** 35 speakers across multiple reports covering EU institutions and agencies  \n**Context:** Joint debate on budget discharge reports for the Commission, Parliament, other EU institutions, agencies, and European Development Funds\n\n## 2. Executive Summary\n\n### Key Issues and Positions\n\nThe debate revealed significant tensions around EU budget accountability, with several critical issues dominating the discussion:\n\n**Commission Discharge - Mixed Progress**\nJan Mulder (ALDE), the primary rapporteur, recommended granting discharge to the Commission despite ongoing concerns: \"I would advise the House to grant discharge to the Commission in respect of the financial year 2004. This may come as a surprise to you, because as everyone knows... the Court of Auditors has not issued a Statement of Assurance about the Commission's conduct of policy for 11 years in a row\" [Mulder, 2006-04-26]. His justification centered on the Commission being in office for only one month in 2004 and their ambitious reform efforts.\n\nCommissioner Siim Kallas acknowledged progress while admitting ongoing challenges: \"Today we are looking at a glass which is certainly only half full, but is gradually filling up\" [Kallas, 2006-04-26]. He reported that expenditures approved by the Court of Auditors represent nearly one-third of the EU budget.\n\n**Parliament Discharge - Strasbourg Scandal**\nA major controversy emerged regarding Parliament's rental arrangements in Strasbourg. Markus Ferber (PPE-DE), Parliament's rapporteur, revealed serious irregularities: \"We need to look into whether the city of Strasbourg... has concluded a rental agreement with us for a sum significantly different from the sum that it pays to the pension fund \u2013 and not to the detriment of Strasbourg, but to its benefit\" [Ferber, 2006-04-26].\n\nMultiple speakers expressed outrage at the potential overcharging. Alexander Stubb (PPE-DE) called for investigation: \"Finally, we should vote against discharge for the European Parliament and begin the investigation\" [Stubb, 2006-04-26]. The scandal involved allegations that Strasbourg charged Parliament more rent than it paid to the actual building owners for 25 years, potentially costing millions.\n\n**Committee of the Regions - Ongoing Investigations**\nNils Lundgren (IND/DEM) strongly opposed discharging the Committee of the Regions due to ongoing OLAF investigations: \"It would be irresponsible to grant discharge before we know the results of this investigation\" [Lundgren, 2006-04-26]. He criticized the Committee on Budgetary Control for refusing to hear testimony from OLAF investigators about potential fraud.\n\n**Member State Accountability**\nA recurring theme was the need for greater Member State responsibility. Terence Wynn (PSE) raised concerns about compliance: \"I am informed... that five Member States have said that they will not comply with what has been agreed in the interinstitutional agreement. Among those Member States I am told that Spain, Belgium, Germany, France and perhaps Italy\" [Wynn, 2006-04-26].\n\n### Arguments and Proposals\n\n**For Transparency and Accountability:**\nMultiple speakers demanded enhanced transparency. Ingeborg Gr\u00e4\u00dfle (PPE-DE) revealed concerning financial irregularities: \"In Germany we would call them 'black accounts'\" [Gr\u00e4\u00dfle, 2006-04-26], referring to unofficial Commission accounts not included in official balance sheets.\n\n**Against Premature Decisions:**\nSeveral speakers advocated for postponing discharge decisions pending investigations. Paulo Casaca (PSE) explained the rationale: \"We are also saying very clearly that where there is a question that raises serious doubts, we will not simply say 'Amen', no matter how painful that may be to some\" [Casaca, 2006-04-26].\n\n**Procedural Concerns:**\nThe debate's timing was heavily criticized. Jos\u00e9 Javier Pom\u00e9s Ruiz (PPE-DE) protested: \"Why is this debate being held at night? Does somebody want to protect the City of Strasbourg?\" [Pom\u00e9s Ruiz, 2006-04-26].\n\n### Key Proposals\n\n1. **Enhanced Member State Accountability**: Requiring finance ministers to sign declarations about EU fund management\n2. **Investigation Mechanisms**: Establishing parliamentary inquiry committees and OLAF referrals for the Strasbourg case\n3. **Transparency Improvements**: Including all unofficial accounts in official EU balance sheets\n4. **Institutional Reforms**: Consolidating Parliament operations to reduce the costly three-location arrangement\n\n### Outcome and Implications\n\nThe debate concluded with clear intentions to postpone Parliament's discharge pending investigation of the Strasbourg allegations. As Szabolcs Fazakas (PSE) summarized: \"I must ask my fellow MEPs to postpone the discharge until we receive detailed, comprehensive answers to all questions that have been asked. We owe this not only to public opinion, but also to ourselves and to the reputation of the entire European Parliament\" [Fazakas, 2006-04-26].\n\nThe 2004 discharge debate thus became a watershed moment for EU accountability, combining routine budget oversight with explosive revelations about institutional financial management that would reshape expectations for transparency and oversight in EU institutions.", "src_model": "claude", "model_type": "claude", "model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "structured": false, "incremental": false, "hierarchical": false, "grouped": false, "shuffle": false, "prompt": false, "lang": "english"}
