{"speaker": "Siim Kallas,", "english": "Siim Kallas, Vice-President of the European Commission. \u2013 (ET) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen.\nToday we are looking at a glass which is certainly only half full, but is gradually filling up.\nThis year, in addition to the positive endorsement of the European Union\u2019s budget accounting, revenues, appropriations, administrative expenditures and the European Development Fund, the European Court of Auditors is quite satisfied with the supervision of agricultural expenditures and the aid granted to candidate states. The expenditures that the Court of Auditors approved of represent nearly one third of the European Union\u2019s budget. I am pleased that this progress is also reflected in Parliament\u2019s reports, and that it has been proposed that Parliament should approve the Commission\u2019s implementation of the budget.\nAllow me to express my sincere gratitude to rapporteurs Mr\u00a0Jan\u00a0Mulder, Mrs\u00a0Rodi\u00a0Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou (who examined the European Development Fund) and Mr\u00a0Szabolcs\u00a0Fazakas, Chairman of Parliament\u2019s Committee on Budgetary Control, who have skilfully guided the entire process. Parliament has drawn up an extensive list of recommendations for improvements. The Commission intends to observe most of these, and to report on this as required.\nWe all know that the glass is not yet full, but Parliament supports the plan approved by the Commission in June 2005 to devise an integrated internal control framework, as well as the action plan approved by the Commission in January 2006.\nNow that we know what is missing, let me concentrate on the missing part. Firstly, I applaud Parliament for the text of the inter-institutional agreement, which arose as a result of negotiations held with the Council and for the first time mentions issues of budget control and endorsement.\nWe all know that the implementation of this political agreement will require continued work, and the Commission certainly intends to do its utmost in the achievement of that objective.\nWe also seek to improve the expression of accountability vis-\u00e0-vis the European Parliament and the European taxpayer. We plan to devote a considerable amount of attention to three measures.\nFirstly, we will strengthen the procedure for the preparation of Annual Activity Reports and improve its consistency across General Directorates. We will also make amendments to the Synthesis Report, although not as elaborately as the European Parliament has recommended.\nSecondly, we will enhance transparency in the use of EU funds. Next week the Commission will adopt a Green Paper on the European Transparency Initiative. As part of the paper, the Commission will propose the introduction of an obligation on Member States to publish the list of beneficiaries of EU funds under shared management. To that end, the Commission will establish a centralised web portal.\nThirdly, we will continue to increase the participation of national auditing institutions. Last week, the Commission sent each of these national audit institutions detailed lists of all of the payments made to their respective Member States in 2005, also inviting them to share the results of their audits with the Commission and the Court of Auditors. This is an initial stage of the implementation of our Action Plan, and I know that several national auditing institutions are prepared to verify the sound use of EU funds in their countries. Thus the first steps have been taken in this direction, and I intend to raise this matter at the meeting of the coordinating committee of the European and national audit courts, to be held in Poland at the end of this year.\nHonourable Members, when I appeared before you last year I said that \u2018mobilising and motivating the Member States will not be easy, and the Commission continues to need your support\u2019. I have enjoyed that support in the past year, and I wish to confirm that we, for our part, will do our utmost. As a first step, we plan to follow the recommendations you will adopt today.\nThank you for your attention.", "lang": "ET", "original": "Siim Kallas, Euroopa Komisjoni asepresident . H\u00e4rra eesistuja, austatud parlamendiliikmed!\nT\u00e4na on meie ees klaas, mis on k\u00fcll alles poolenisti t\u00e4is, kuid mida j\u00e4rk-j\u00e4rgult aina t\u00e4idetakse.\nLisaks positiivsele kinnitusele, mis on antud Euroopa Liidu eelarve raamatupidamisarvestusele, tuludele, assigneeringutele, halduskuludele ja Euroopa Arengufondile, on kontrollikoda \u00fcsna rahul sellega, kuidas kontrollitakse p\u00f5llumajanduskulusid ja kandidaatriikidele antavat abi. Need kulud, millega koda rahul oli, moodustavad ligikaudu kolmandiku Euroopa Liidu eelarvest. Mul on hea meel, et neid edusamme on kajastatud ka parlamendi aruannetes ning et parlamendile on tehtud ettepanek kinnitada komisjonipoolne eelarve t\u00e4itmine.\nLubage mul siinkohal t\u00e4nada raport\u00f6\u00f6re hr Jan Mulderit, Euroopa Arengufondi k\u00e4sitlenud pr Rodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulout ja parlamendi eelarvekontrollikomisjoni esimeest hr Szabolcs Fazakast, kes kogu menetlust on oskuslikult juhtinud. Parlament on koostanud ulatusliku nimekirja parandussoovitustest, millest enamikku kavatseb komisjon j\u00e4rgida ja sellest ka n\u00f5uetekohaselt aru anda.\nMe k\u00f5ik teame, et klaas ei ole veel t\u00e4is, kuid parlament toetab 2005. aasta juunis komisjoni poolt heaks kiidetud plaani koostada \u00fchtne sisekontrolliraamistik ja 2006. aasta jaanuaris vastu v\u00f5etud tegevuskava.\nN\u00fc\u00fcd, kus me teame, mis on puudu, lubage mul keskenduda just sellele puuduolevale osale. Esmalt soovin ma tunnustada parlamenti institutsioonidevahelise kokkuleppe teksti eest, mis s\u00fcndis n\u00f5ukoguga peetud l\u00e4bir\u00e4\u00e4kimiste tulemusena ja milles esimest korda k\u00e4sitletakse eelarvekontrolli ja kinnitamist.\nMe teame, et selle poliitilise kokkuleppe rakendamiseks on vaja j\u00e4tkuvalt t\u00f6\u00f6d teha ja komisjon kavatseb selleks kindlasti anda endast parima.\nSamuti on meie eesm\u00e4rk parandada aruandluse viise Euroopa Parlamendile ja Euroopa maksumaksjale. P\u00f5hit\u00e4helepanu kavatseme p\u00f6\u00f6rata kolmele meetmele.\nEsiteks t\u00e4iustame iga-aastase tegevusaruande koostamise menetlust ja parandame selle \u00fchtlust peadirektoraatide tasandil. Samuti teeme parandusi koondaruandesse, kuigi mitte nii \u00fcksikasjalikult, kui Euroopa Parlament seda on soovitanud.\nTeiseks suurendame Euroopa Liidu rahaliste vahendite kasutamise l\u00e4bipaistvust. J\u00e4rgmisel n\u00e4dalal v\u00f5tab komisjon vastu rohelise raamatu Euroopa avatuse algatuse kohta. Selles teeb komisjon ettepaneku kehtestada liikmesriikidele kohustus avaldada \u00fchiselt hallatavatest Euroopa Liidu vahenditest abi saajate nimekiri. Samuti suurendab komisjon otse komisjoni halduses olevate vahendite kasutamise l\u00e4bipaistvust. Selleks on kavas avada tsentraliseeritud veebiportaal.\nKolmandaks soovime j\u00e4tkuvalt suurendada riikide auditeerimisasutuste osalust. Eelmisel n\u00e4dalal saatis komisjon iga liikmesriigi auditeerimisasutusele \u00fcksikasjaliku nimekirja asjaomasele riigile 2005. aastal tehtud v\u00e4ljamaksetest. \u00dchtlasi \u00e4rgitati auditeerimisasutusi edastama oma auditite tulemusi ka komisjonile ja kontrollikojale. Tegemist on meie tegevuskava rakendamise algusetapiga ja mul on andmeid, et mitme liikmesriigi auditeerimisasutused on valmis oma riigis Euroopa Liidu vahendite n\u00f5uetekohast kasutamist kontrollima. Niisiis on selles suunas juba tehtud esimesi samme ja mul on kavas t\u00f5statada see k\u00fcsimus aasta l\u00f5pus Poolas toimuval \u00fchenduse ja liikmesriikide auditeerimisasutuste koosk\u00f5lastuskomitee koosolekul.\nLugupeetud parlamendiliikmed, eelmisel aastal teie ees esinedes \u00fctlesin, et liikmesriikide kaasamine ja motiveerimine ei ole lihtne ja komisjon vajab ka edaspidi teie toetust. Seda toetust olen viimase aasta jooksul tundnud ja kinnitan, et ka meie omalt poolt teeme k\u00f5ik endast oleneva. Esimese sammuna kavatseme j\u00e4rgida soovitusi, mille te t\u00e4na vastu v\u00f5tate.\nT\u00e4nan t\u00e4helepanu eest!", "agenda_item": "Discharges for the implementation of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2004 (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060426-ITEM-015", "intervention_id": "3-168", "summary_english": "```json\n{\n  \"headline\": \"Commission Reports Progress on EU Budget Implementation While Acknowledging Areas Still Needing Improvement\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"The speaker addresses the discharge process for the 2004 EU budget, highlighting progress in budget accounting oversight while acknowledging ongoing challenges.
