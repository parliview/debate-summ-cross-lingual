{"speaker": "Hans-Peter Martin (NI).", "english": "Hans-Peter Martin (NI). \u2013 (DE) Mr President, well may we complain about this time. Almost 100\u00a0million people are currently watching live \u2013 not here, but inside in front of the television where the rest of the world is \u2013 watching Barcelona against Milan; the score is 0:0, by the way. And here? I can see three girls here and 11 boys \u2013 and one of them was specifically asked to stay. One wonders what is political about this debate: this is a matter of substance. This is about \u2013 if we take it seriously, which we are not doing to judge by the yawns of the Commission \u2013 the discharge, about billions of euros.\nWe all know, though \u2013 if we really look closely \u2013 that nobody here can in good conscience, if he has a conscience at all, agree to the discharge. We are all well aware of the 'you scratch my back, and I will scratch yours' attitude. We know that we have allowed this Europe, this Union, to be steamrollered by a Mafia-like system where everybody, quite logically, does just what everybody else is doing. What, then, is so terrible about the city of Strasbourg? They are just doing exactly what many of the Members of this Parliament have done too: they are cashing in a bit. What is happening here is dangerous, very dangerous.\nSixty-one years after the end of the war, we are drifting towards the end of democracy and prosperity for large sections of the population in Europe, because we just let things slide, because the Anti-Fraud Commissioner Mr\u00a0Kallas cannot implement the European transparency initiative about which he has been speaking because his hands are always tied, precisely because there is no more leadership in politics. Tomorrow, please listen to the conscience that you at least used to have when you entered politics, and reject all the so-called discharge reports.\nWe need to make a new start \u2013 it is the only thing that can help Europe in this situation!", "lang": "DE", "original": "Hans-Peter Martin (NI). \u2013 Herr Pr\u00e4sident! Ach, um diese Zeit sollte man gr\u00fcbeln. Fast 100 Millionen Menschen sind im Augenblick live dabei \u2013 nicht hier, sondern drinnen, dort, wo die Welt ist, vor dem Fernseher \u2013 und schauen Barcelona gegen Mailand; es steht \u00fcbrigens 0:0. Und hier? Drei H\u00e4nsinnen z\u00e4hle ich und elf H\u00e4nschen \u2013 einen extra noch gebeten, dass er doch bleiben m\u00f6ge. Da fragt man sich: Was ist das Politische an der Debatte? Hier geht es doch um Substanz. Hier geht es doch \u2013 wenn wir uns ernst nehmen w\u00fcrden, was wir nicht tun, wenn ich zu den g\u00e4hnenden Gesichtern der Kommission hin\u00fcberblicke \u2013 um Entlastung, um Milliarden.\nWir wissen doch alle \u2013 wenn wir genau hinschauen\u00a0\u2013, dass keiner von uns mit gutem Gewissen, sofern er noch eines hat, hier wirklich Entlastung geben kann. Wir wissen doch genau, wie dann eine Hand die andere w\u00e4scht. Wir wissen, dass wir es zugelassen haben, dieses Europa, diese Union, von einer Art mafi\u00f6sem System \u00fcberrollen zu lassen, wo der eine eben das macht, was der andere logischerweise auch macht. Was ist denn so schlimm an der Stadt Stra\u00dfburg? Die machen doch genau das, was ganz viele Kolleginnen und Kollegen hier auch gemacht haben: ein bisserl abcashen. Das ist gef\u00e4hrlich, was da l\u00e4uft. Das ist ganz gef\u00e4hrlich!\nWir steuern 61\u00a0Jahre nach dem Friedensschluss auf das Ende der Demokratie und des Wohlstands f\u00fcr breite Schichten in Europa zu, weil man das einfach so rollen l\u00e4sst, weil der Herr Betrugskommissar Kallas die Europ\u00e4ische Transparenz-Initiative, von der er gesprochen hat, nicht zustande bringt, weil ihm st\u00e4ndig die H\u00e4nde gebunden sind, weil es eben nicht mehr F\u00fchrung in der Politik gibt.
