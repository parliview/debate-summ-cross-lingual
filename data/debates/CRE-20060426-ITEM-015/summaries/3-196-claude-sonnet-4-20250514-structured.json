{"speaker": "Szabolcs Fazakas (PSE). \u2013", "english": "Szabolcs Fazakas (PSE). \u2013 (HU) Firstly, I would like to thank the rapporteurs, and especially Mr\u00a0Jan\u00a0Mulder, who is still here at this late hour, as well as all the committee members for the excellent and hard work they have done over the past six months. Commissioner Siim Kallas also deserves our thanks for his excellent cooperation with us in all areas, the best proof of which is the fact that he is still available to us at this very late hour for this important debate.\nAs a result of the current discharge procedure, we wish to take a further big step in the direction of the positive DAS formulated as our joint goal. The fact that we are finally achieving this goal after eleven years is not only important to us, MEPs, the Commission and the Court of Auditors, but also to public opinion, and therefore to the reputation of the entire European institutional system. We must prove that we are using the taxpayers\u2019 money correctly, efficiently and in a transparent manner.\nWhile I value the results achieved in this area, in view of the most recent developments I must mention that in the case of Parliament, contrary to the original committee proposal, I must ask my fellow MEPs to postpone the discharge until we receive detailed, comprehensive answers to all questions that have been asked. We owe this not only to public opinion, but also to ourselves and to the reputation of the entire European Parliament.", "lang": "HU", "original": "Szabolcs Fazakas (PSE). \u2013 El\u0151sz\u00f6r is k\u00f6sz\u00f6netet szeretn\u00e9k mondani a raport\u0151r\u00f6knek, els\u0151sorban az ilyen k\u00e9s\u0151i \u00f3r\u00e1n is jelenl\u00e9v\u0151 Jan Mulder \u00farnak, illetve a bizotts\u00e1g minden tagj\u00e1nak az\u00e9rt a kiv\u00e1l\u00f3, neh\u00e9z munk\u00e1\u00e9rt, amit az elm\u00falt 6 h\u00f3napban v\u00e9geztek.
