I can tell you that things sometimes appear in the press in Spain that are not really 100% true or which have been manipulated; therefore, since the Committee on Budgetary Control, the Legal Service \u2014 and quite rightly at this point, I believe \u2014 has advised us not to vote, since it was not our report, but rather plenary\u2019s \u2013 since once we have voted for Mr\u00a0Ferber\u2019s report it becomes plenary\u2019s report \u2013 I would ask the Members and Mr\u00a0Ferber in particular \u2014 though I cannot see him in the Chamber at the moment \u2014 not to make us vote to discharge, when it does not really mean a discharge.\nI would ask Mr\u00a0Ferber to avoid a vote which may be ambiguous, wrongly interpreted and manipulated once again by the press. Instead, I would ask you, before the vote, to consider the possibility of the referral of your report back to the Committee on Budgetary Control, which has not been able to deal with it today, precisely because it was plenary that could decide on it; but to ask plenary to return it to us before recording a negative vote, which means something different: voting no to something without having clarified why we are voting no.\nI would prefer it, therefore, Mr President, if possible, if Parliament\u2019s services and my fellow Members could guarantee that possibility; that before voting no in a manner that could be interpreted as a badly prepared \u2018no\u2019, since we only received this information yesterday, we could prevent that by returning this report to the Committee on Budgetary Control, which would do its work again.", "lang": "ES", "original": "In\u00e9s Ayala Sender (PSE). \u2013 (ES) Se\u00f1or Presidente, querr\u00eda unirme al coro general de preocupaci\u00f3n y de sorpresa por la situaci\u00f3n en la que hoy nos encontramos en v\u00edsperas de votar la aprobaci\u00f3n de la gesti\u00f3n relativa a la ejecuci\u00f3n del presupuesto general de la Uni\u00f3n Europea del ejercicio 2004, que, realmente, ven\u00edamos preparando y que la Comisi\u00f3n de Control Presupuestario hab\u00eda preparado con toda la atenci\u00f3n y la informaci\u00f3n necesarias.\nPrecisamente la v\u00edspera de este debate nos encontramos con una informaci\u00f3n que aparece en la prensa... Puedo decir que en Espa\u00f1a a veces en la prensa aparecen cosas que no son reales al 100\u00a0% o que se han manipulado; por lo tanto, ya que la Comisi\u00f3n de Control Presupuestario, el Servicio Jur\u00eddico \u2014y creo que con raz\u00f3n en ese momento\u2014, nos ha aconsejado no votar, puesto que el informe ya no era nuestro, sino que era del Pleno, porque una vez que hemos votado el informe del se\u00f1or Ferber ya es del Pleno, yo solicitar\u00eda a los colegas y al se\u00f1or Ferber en particular \u2014aunque no lo veo en este momento en la sala\u2014 que no nos hagan ma\u00f1ana votar no a la aprobaci\u00f3n, con un significado que no es el real de la aprobaci\u00f3n.\nLe pedir\u00eda al se\u00f1or Ferber que evit\u00e1semos una votaci\u00f3n que puede resultar ambigua, malinterpretada, manipulada una vez m\u00e1s en la prensa. En cambio, le pedir\u00eda que detuviera, antes de la votaci\u00f3n, la posibilidad de devolver su informe a la Comisi\u00f3n de Control Presupuestario, que hoy no ha podido tratarlo, precisamente porque el Pleno era quien pod\u00eda decidir sobre ello; que le pidiera al Pleno que nos lo devolviera antes de obtener un voto negativo, que significa algo distinto: votamos no a algo sin haber aclarado por qu\u00e9 votamos no.\nPor lo tanto, yo preferir\u00eda, si es posible, se\u00f1or Presidente, que, en este sentido, los servicios de la C\u00e1mara y mis colegas pudieran asegurar esa posibilidad; que antes de votar un no que puede ser interpretado realmente como un \u00abno\u00bb mal preparado, puesto que esta informaci\u00f3n lleg\u00f3 ayer mismo, pudi\u00e9semos evitarlo devolviendo este informe a la Comisi\u00f3n de Control Presupuestario, que har\u00eda su trabajo de nuevo.", "agenda_item": "Discharges for the implementation of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2004 (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060426-ITEM-015", "intervention_id": "3-194", "summary_english": "```json\n{\n  \"headline\": \"MEP Requests Postponement of EU Budget Discharge Vote Due to Last-Minute Press Information\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"The speaker raises concerns about proceeding with the vote on the EU budget discharge for 2004 due to last-minute information appearing in the press that could not be properly evaluated.
