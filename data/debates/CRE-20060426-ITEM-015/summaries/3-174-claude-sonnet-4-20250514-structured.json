{"speaker": "Alexander Stubb,", "english": "Alexander Stubb, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . \u2013 Mr President, I have three points. My first point is that the timing of this debate is a disgrace: it was supposed to start at 6 p.m. and it is now 9.30 p.m. It is going to go on all evening. It is one of the most important issues that we have. Are we trying to hide something from the public?\nMy second point is that I am the shadow rapporteur on the Mulder report on discharge for the Commission. I should like to congratulate my colleague and friend, Mr\u00a0Mulder, on an excellent report and I would like to point out that 80% of money misuse is still happening in the Member States. The Commission is doing an excellent job. It is not more control we need, but better control.\nMy third and final point concerns discharge for the European Parliament. I have four points on that. Firstly, it is very important that at this stage we stick to the facts. We should start researching to see what actually happened. It is very easy for all of us to wonder whether Strasbourg is the right seat or not. I do not think that is the issue right now. Let us look at what really happened. Secondly, there are two issues at stake here: we need to look at what the administration of the European Parliament has done in the past 25 years, and we need to look at what the city of Strasbourg has done. It certainly looks as if it has violated the spirit of the agreement we have with the city itself. Thirdly, we need more information. I agree with Mr Ferber, the rapporteur on this issue, who said recently that the press release from Strasbourg \u2013 to which Mrs Kauppi referred \u2013 is absolutely pathetic . They need to give a lot more information or they need to change their whole public relations department. It gives us no information about what actually happened.\nFinally, we should vote against discharge for the European Parliament and begin the investigation.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Alexander Stubb, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . \u2013 Mr President, I have three points.
