{"speaker": "Ona Juknevi\u010dien\u0117", "english": "Ona Juknevi\u010dien\u0117 , on behalf of the ALDE Group . \u2013 (LT) Today, I will perhaps attempt to answer Mr\u00a0Stubb and Mr\u00a0J\u00f8rgensen who asked why we are discussing this question so late and who we want to hide from \u2013 society or ourselves. I would like to remind you that last year, also in April, we voted on the approval of the European Parliament Budget for 2003, where I was the principal rapporteur. And I proposed that the European Parliament should abandon its work in Strasbourg. Today, I am the shadow rapporteur and I would like to remind you, that last year Members of the European Parliament decided to retain three work places and to continue sessions in Strasbourg. Each year, such work or its organisation costs the Community's citizens EUR 200 million. Mr President, do we have the right to be surprised then that Strasbourg city authority is trying to obtain an unrealistically high price for buildings? I do not think so because we encouraged it to take such actions ourselves. The retention of the European Parliament Headquarters in Strasbourg is condemned to continue losing money until we give it up. It is nothing new that there are economic subjects or persons, who commit fraud or even become corrupt. But often they are encouraged to behave in this way by a monopoly situation, illogical laws or political decisions. We ourselves, my fellow Members of Parliament, decided to use the buildings in Strasbourg knowing that they will cost an unjustifiably huge amount of money and will mean losses for the city and its people, as we only use those buildings for a few days a month. This is elementary economic logic. Many times it has been calculated and argued that if another institution were to move into the European Parliament buildings, working all year long, then this would be of more benefit to the city economically and financially. Therefore, we must accept that we all know this, but for some reason we do not want to change the situation. I believe that the people of Strasbourg, like all the other citizens of the Community, have become the hostages of incorrect decisions we have made ourselves. I support the proposal to postpone the approval of the European Parliament budget until we have examined how many more losses the people of Europe have experienced. It is very important to ascertain whether there has been corruption or violations of laws and agreements, but it is far more important, honourable Members of Parliament, to finally make the decision to give up this unjustifiable, shameful waste of European people's money. We have to work effectively in one place and we must use money where it is most needed.", "lang": "LT", "original": "Ona Juknevi\u010dien\u0117, ALDE frakcijos vardu . \u2013 Galb\u016bt a\u0161 \u0161iandien pasistengsiu atsakyti A. Stubb ir D. J\u00f8rgensen, kod\u0117l mes taip v\u0117lai diskutuojame \u0161iuo klausimu ir nuo ko mes norime pasisl\u0117pti, ar nuo visuomen\u0117s, ar patys nuo sav\u0119s. A\u0161 noriu priminti, kad pernai irgi baland\u012f mes balsavome d\u0117l 2003 met\u0173 Europos Parlamento biud\u017eeto patvirtinimo, kur a\u0161 buvau pagrindin\u0117 prane\u0161\u0117ja. Ir a\u0161 si\u016bliau, kad Europos Parlamentas atsisakyt\u0173 darbo Strasb\u016bre. \u0160iandien a\u0161 esu \u0161e\u0161\u0117lin\u0117 prane\u0161\u0117ja ir noriu priminti, kad pernai Parlamento nariai nutar\u0117 i\u0161laikyti tris darbo vietas ir t\u0119sti pos\u0117d\u017eius Strasb\u016bre. Kasmet toks m\u016bs\u0173 darbas arba jo organizavimas kainuoja 200 mln. eur\u0173 Bendrijos pilie\u010diams. Pirmininke, ar mes turime \u0161iandien teis\u0119 steb\u0117tis, kad Strasb\u016bro miesto vald\u017eia stengiasi u\u017e pastatus gauti nepagr\u012fstai auk\u0161t\u0105 kain\u0105? Manau, kad ne, nes mes patys j\u0105 paskatinome tokiems veiksmams. Europos Parlamento b\u016bstin\u0117s i\u0161laikymas Strasb\u016bre yra pasmerktas b\u016bti nuostolingas tol, kol mes jo neatsisakysime. Ne naujiena, kad pasitaiko \u016bkio subjekt\u0173 arba asmen\u0173, kurie suk\u010diauja ar net tampa korumpuoti. Ta\u010diau ypa\u010d da\u017enai juos taip elgtis skatina monopolin\u0117 pad\u0117tis, nelogi\u0161ki \u012fstatymai arba politiniai sprendimai. Mes patys nutar\u0117me, gerbiami Parlamento nariai, naudotis pastatais Strasb\u016bre \u017einodami, kad jie kainuos nepateisinamai mil\u017eini\u0161kas l\u0117\u0161as ir ne\u0161 nuostolius miestui ir jo \u017emon\u0117ms, nes mes naudojam\u0117s tais pastatais tik kelias dienas per m\u0117nes\u012f. Tai yra elementari ekonomin\u0117 logika. Ne kart\u0105 yra apskai\u010diuota ir pagr\u012fsta, kad jeigu Europos Parlamento pastatuose \u012fsikurt\u0173 kita institucija, dirbanti i\u0161tisus metus, miestui b\u016bt\u0173 ekonomi\u0161kai ir finansi\u0161kai daug naudingiau. Tod\u0117l mes turime prisipa\u017einti, kad visi tai \u017einome, ta\u010diau ka\u017ekod\u0117l nenorime keisti situacijos. Manau, kad Strasb\u016bro \u017emon\u0117s, kaip ir visi kiti Bendrijos pilie\u010diai, tapo m\u016bs\u0173 pa\u010di\u0173 priimt\u0173 neteising\u0173 sprendim\u0173 \u012fkaitais.

Labai svarbu i\u0161siai\u0161kinti, ar b\u016bta suk\u010diavim\u0173, ar b\u016bta \u012fstatym\u0173 ir sutar\u010di\u0173 pa\u017eeidim\u0173, ta\u010diau daug svarbiau, gerbiami Parlamento nariai, gal\u0173 gale priimti sprendim\u0105 ir atsisakyti nepateisinamo, g\u0117dingo Europos \u017emoni\u0173 pinig\u0173 \u0161vaistymo.
