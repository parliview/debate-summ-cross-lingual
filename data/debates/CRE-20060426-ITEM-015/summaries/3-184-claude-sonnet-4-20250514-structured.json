It must be stressed that the endorsement of their financial accounts only reflects the agencies' financial situation, but in order to comprehensively assess the use of agency funds, an audit of the activities of these agencies must be carried out. After all, the agencies must spend the money appropriately.\nAt the moment, when reading the audit report, it is completely unclear why one agency was able to carry out several checks in places, and another just a few. Why in one agency there is one particular employee ratio involved in administrative and operational activities, and in another agency there is a different one.\nAll of this, in particular the auditors' certification that part of the budget is to be carried over to next year, indicates that the agencies are not managing funds effectively. Therefore, I would like to propose that the European Court of Auditors debate the possibility of broadening its special annual reports on the agencies and of including in these a \u2018cost-benefit\u2019 analysis of the agencies' activities.\nI dare doubt whether institutions with activities like agencies, that is they are not accountable to anyone, are characteristic of an EU which promotes democratic values. Mr\u00a0Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, often comes to my Committee \u2013 on Economy \u2013 to respond to questions posed by Members of the European Parliament. He is accountable via MEPs to the citizens of the European Union. However, the heads of the agencies are not accountable to anyone, and in its answers to the European Court of Auditors' comments on faults found, the Commission points out that it can only help agencies to solve these problems, but the agencies themselves have to decide whether or not they will implement the auditors' recommendations. I believe that they ought to be accountable to the appropriate committees in the European Parliament.", "lang": "LT", "original": "Margarita Starkevi\u010di\u016bt\u0117 (ALDE). \u2013 Nor\u0117\u010diau pakalb\u0117ti apie agent\u016br\u0173 biud\u017eeto \u012fvykdymo ataskait\u0105.
