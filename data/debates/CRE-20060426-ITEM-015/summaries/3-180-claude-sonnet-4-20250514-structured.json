{"speaker": "Mogens N.J. Camre,", "english": "Mogens N.J. Camre, on behalf of the UEN Group. \u2013 (DA) Mr\u00a0President, I should firstly like to thank my fellow Member, Mr\u00a0Mulder, for all the painstaking work he has done, as well as thank the other rapporteurs. It is, of course, regrettable that, this year again, we do not have a straightforward statement of assurance. As is well known, the EU should ideally be a model for the Member States, especially for the new countries with new and untried administrations. I doubt, however, whether we are being a particularly good model, given the major problem that exists of our not yet being able to present a straightforward statement of assurance. I agree with Mr\u00a0Mulder\u2019s observation that it is unsatisfactory that the Member States are not prepared to issue statements concerning the supervision of the resources they have received. We must ensure that this is done.\nIt is, of course, also the case that responsibility for the administration cannot lie with the Commission alone but that the Council and the Member States also bear some responsibility. There are a number of situations or cases in which I am unable to recommend granting discharge, simply because we would then be granting this in the dark. In some areas we are taking on tasks that, in reality, we cannot carry out. Proof of that is the situation concerning Parliament\u2019s accounts, as described today by Mr\u00a0Ferber. Yesterday we were certain that everything was in order and we were ready to grant discharge, but in the course of the night we knew better.\nIt is of course by pure chance that we are now in a situation in which we must ask for the discharge to be postponed because we simply do not know enough. It is of course quite odd that, for 25 years, both Parliament\u2019s administration and our audit department have overlooked \u2013 at least they say they have done so \u2013 an extremely dubious payment to the city of Strasbourg. This is, of course, in reality a payment to a quite superfluous middleman, and if anyone in our administration would have us believe they did not know this, I have to say that I do not believe that the administration is so incompetent.\nWhat is more, it has to be asked whether it really is possible to enter into such financial agreements without carefully evaluating the various options and offers. No, of course it is not. Someone has helped someone else obtain an illicit dollop of taxpayers\u2019 money, and, if I know the system, no one will be held liable because, of course, no one knew anything. As the Commission\u2019s previous President, Mr\u00a0Prodi, said about the Eurostat scandal: what one does not know about, one cannot be held liable for. Do not, then, read through the contracts. In that way you can always say that you did not know anything and so be free from liability.\nAs I say, we could have got away with granting discharge, but we are not going to grant it. I am able to recommend that the granting of discharge be postponed, as proposed by Mr\u00a0Ferber. As for the other areas, our attitude is described in the report.", "lang": "DA", "original": "Mogens N.J. Camre, for UEN-Gruppen . - Hr. formand F\u00f8rst tak til min gode kollega hr. Mulder for et stort omhyggeligt arbejde og lige s\u00e5dan til de \u00f8vrige ordf\u00f8rere. Det er naturligvis beklageligt, at vi igen i \u00e5r st\u00e5r uden en ren revisionserkl\u00e6ring. Som bekendt skulle EU gerne v\u00e6re forbillede for medlemslandene, ikke mindst for de nye lande med nye og upr\u00f8vede administrationer. Jeg tvivler dog p\u00e5, at vi udg\u00f8r et s\u00e6rligt godt forbillede med et s\u00e5 stort problem, som det er, at vi endnu ikke kan freml\u00e6gge en ren revisionserkl\u00e6ring. Jeg er enig med hr. Mulder i hans betragtninger om, at det er utilfredsstillende, at medlemsstaterne ikke er indstillede p\u00e5 at afgive erkl\u00e6ringer om kontrollen af de midler, som de har modtaget. Vi m\u00e5 sikre, at dette bliver bragt p\u00e5 plads.\nDet er jo rigtigt ogs\u00e5, at ansvaret for forvaltningen ikke kan l\u00e6gges p\u00e5 Kommissionen alene, men at ogs\u00e5 R\u00e5det og medlemsstaterne b\u00e6rer et ansvar. Jeg kan i en r\u00e6kke situationer eller en r\u00e6kke tilf\u00e6lde ikke anbefale at give decharge, simpelthen fordi vi giver den decharge i blinde. Vi p\u00e5tager os p\u00e5 nogle omr\u00e5der en opgave, som vi i virkeligheden ikke kan l\u00f8fte. Et bevis p\u00e5 det er situationen omkring Parlamentets regnskab, som beskrevet af hr. Ferber i dag. I g\u00e5r var vi sikre p\u00e5, at alt var i orden, og vi var klar til at give decharge, og i nattens l\u00f8b er vi s\u00e5 blevet klogere.\nDet er jo et rent tilf\u00e6lde, at vi i dag st\u00e5r i en situation, hvor vi m\u00e5 bede om uds\u00e6ttelse af dechargen, fordi vi simpelthen ikke ved nok. Det er jo ganske ejendommeligt, at b\u00e5de Parlamentets administration og vores revision i 25 \u00e5r har overset noget, som - det siger de i hvert fald, at de har - er en h\u00f8jst angribelig betaling til Strasbourg-by. Der er jo i realiteten tale om en mellemhandleranvance til en helt overfl\u00f8dig mellemhandler. Og hvis nogen i vores administration vil bilde os ind, at de ikke vidste det, s\u00e5 m\u00e5 jeg sige, at jeg ikke tror p\u00e5, at administrationen er s\u00e5 uduelig.\nOg man m\u00e5 sp\u00f8rge, om det virkelig er muligt at indg\u00e5 s\u00e5danne \u00f8konomiske aftaler uden n\u00f8je at vurdere de forskellige muligheder og tilbud. Nej, selvf\u00f8lgelig er det ikke det. Nogen har hjulpet nogen til at f\u00e5 en uretm\u00e6ssig luns af skatteydernes penge, og hvis jeg kender systemet ret, s\u00e5 er der ikke nogen, der bliver gjort ansvarlig, for selvf\u00f8lgelig var der ikke nogen, der vidste noget. Som Kommissionens forrige formand, hr. Prodi, sagde om Eurostat-skandalen: Hvad man ikke ved, kan man ikke have ansvar for. Alts\u00e5 l\u00e6s ikke kontrakterne igennem, s\u00e5 kan man altid sige, at man ikke vidste noget og derfor v\u00e6re ansvarsfri.\nVi kunne som sagt v\u00e6re kommet af sted med at give decharge, men vi g\u00f8r det ikke. Jeg kan anbefale uds\u00e6ttelsen som foresl\u00e5et af hr. Ferber. Og p\u00e5 de andre omr\u00e5der er vores indstilling beskrevet i bet\u00e6nkningen.", "agenda_item": "Discharges for the implementation of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2004 (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060426-ITEM-015", "intervention_id": "3-180", "summary_english": "{\n\"headline\": \"EU Budget Discharge Questioned Due to Lack of Assurance and Dubious Payment to Strasbourg\",\n\"issueSum\": \"The speaker raises concerns about the EU's inability to provide a straightforward statement of assurance for the 2004 budget implementation, Member States' unwillingness to issue supervision statements for received resources, and a dubious payment to Strasbourg that was overlooked for 25 years by Parliament's administration and audit department.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"The speaker supports postponing the discharge rather than granting it, expressing skepticism about the administration's claim of ignorance regarding the dubious Strasbourg payment.
