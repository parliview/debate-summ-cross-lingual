This is a huge scandal we have here, what with the rents and Strasbourg. I obviously share the view that discharge cannot be granted under these circumstances. It is not enough merely to postpone discharge. Rather, we must also resolve all the uncertainties before the issue can finally be settled.\nThat is not, however, the only reason for denying discharge to our own institution. The fact is that the report on discharge has had an airbrush applied to it, and a lot of the serious criticism of the pensions system has been removed. I think that this criticism alone is reason enough for denying the European Parliament discharge. It is not only that our pensions system has no legal basis and is not paid for out of our salaries. It is also badly regulated and has huge deficits paid for by the taxpayers. Moreover, no account has been taken of the Court of Auditors\u2019 criticism. This issue too must be investigated further in the course of the work that lies ahead.", "lang": "SV", "original": "Jonas Sj\u00f6stedt (GUE/NGL). \u2013 Herr talman! \u00c4ven jag vill s\u00e4ga n\u00e5gra ord om bet\u00e4nkandet om ansvarsfriheten f\u00f6r v\u00e5rt eget parlament, Europaparlamentet.
