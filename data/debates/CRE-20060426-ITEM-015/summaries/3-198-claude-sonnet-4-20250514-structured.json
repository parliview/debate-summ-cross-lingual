We sought explanations and guaranteed that nothing and nobody would be able to cover up the truth about what is happening to the Parliament buildings in Strasbourg.\nThis was what we all did, albeit extremely quickly, and I should like to give a special mention at this point to our Committee chairman, who took charge of the process. No less worthy of commendation for his efforts is our rapporteur Mr\u00a0Ferber. Procedurally, the only option open to us if we want to postpone the discharge is of course to vote against, although this is not a vote against the work done by our rapporteur, nor against his report; rather, it is a vote for this work, for what we have been doing and for total transparency.\nThis, ladies and gentlemen, is what we intend to do tomorrow, with conviction. I wish you all the best in your work over the coming six months.
