{"speaker": "Caroline Lucas (Verts/ALE). \u2013", "english": "Caroline Lucas (Verts/ALE). \u2013 Mr President, I warmly welcome Mr Trakatellis\u2019s report. I thank and congratulate him for his excellent work on it. I also want to add my voice to those who deplore the reduced funding for the area concerned. My group will support Amendment\u00a064. In fact my group originally proposed an even higher level of funding, as you may recall.\nI should like to highlight, once again, one of the key issues that has already been raised and on which my group has tabled an amendment, namely the contribution of complementary and alternative medicine. Over 100\u00a0million EU citizens are already using complementary medicine and its popularity is growing rapidly. Improving people\u2019s knowledge about complementary and alternative medicine can be an important way of enabling them to make more responsible and better informed choices about their health. Therefore, I believe it is vital that we bring that area of medicine out of the ghetto and into the mainstream and recognise the very real benefits it can bring.\nHeightened public awareness of the dangers of chemicals in the food chain, growing resistance to antibiotics through over-use and concern about the side-effects of some conventional drugs are all contributing to a massive re-think about the way we live and how we seek to regain our health. Complementary medicines with a holistic and person-centred approach are attracting an ever-widening public. It is important to acknowledge that as a phenomenon. Yet there is still a huge disparity between public demand for those medicines and the negligible amount of funding for research in that field. It is vital that we close that gap.\nI strongly support those amendments which refer to the seriousness of environmental pollution as a risk to health and a major source of concern for European citizens. That needs to be addressed urgently as part of a preventive healthcare strategy.\nAs Mrs Breyer has already set out, our group believes that the participation of civil society is vitally important to the formulation and implementation of European health policy. I welcome the proposed increase in funding to enable its greater involvement, as I do the criteria outlined in Amendment\u00a053, which makes clear the need for independence from industry, commercial and business interests.\nAmendment 141, by the Liberals, however, muddies the water and takes away precisely the legal certainty that Amendment 53 sets out. For that reason I would urge colleagues to reject it.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Caroline Lucas (Verts/ALE). \u2013 Mr President, I warmly welcome Mr Trakatellis\u2019s report.
