{"speaker": "Anders Samuelsen (ALDE),", "english": "Anders Samuelsen (ALDE), draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. \u2013 (DA) Mr\u00a0President, I wish to begin by thanking Mr\u00a0Trakatellis on the sterling work he has done on the matter we are debating today. This is most certainly one of the areas for which real grass-roots support may be secured. There is a lot of talk about there being a rather defensive approach to European cooperation at the moment, especially after the votes in the Netherlands and France on the Constitutional Treaty. All investigations show, however, that it is very difficult to find grass-roots opposition to cross-border cooperation on precisely the areas we are debating today. It is, of course, therefore also important for me to emphasise that we support the work done so far. We support the attempt to split the two programmes up, and we are in favour of securing as substantial funding for the programmes as it is reasonably possible to obtain.\nI would particularly emphasise that the report includes a proposal from the Committee on Budgets, designed to ensure that the Commission can grant core funding on a two-year basis by means of network partnership conventions. The idea is to make sure that as few resources as possible are expended on bureaucracy and that most go into increased efforts in those areas about which we are in agreement. With that, I should like once again to thank Mr\u00a0Trakatellis for his considerable efforts. I hope that we really will succeed in sending a clear signal to Europeans that the EU can make a difference of benefit to us all in this area.", "lang": "DA", "original": "Anders Samuelsen (ALDE), ordf\u00f8rer for udtalelse fra Budgetudvalget . - Hr. formand Jeg vil starte med at takke hr. Trakatellis for hans store arbejde med den sag, som vi behandler i dag. Det er helt sikkert et af de omr\u00e5der, som man virkelig kan sikre folkelig opbakning bag. Der tales meget om en lidt defensiv tilgang til det europ\u00e6iske samarbejde i \u00f8jeblikket, ikke mindst efter afstemningerne om forfatningstraktaten i Holland og Frankrig. Alle unders\u00f8gelser viser imidlertid, at det er meget sv\u00e6rt at finde folkelig modstand mod gr\u00e6nseoverskridende samarbejde p\u00e5 netop de omr\u00e5der, som vi behandler i dag. Derfor er det selvf\u00f8lgelig ogs\u00e5 vigtigt for mig at understrege, at vi bakker om det arbejde, som er gjort hidtil. Vi bakker op om fors\u00f8get p\u00e5 at f\u00e5 splittet de to programmer op, og vi bakker op om at sikre en s\u00e5 god \u00f8konomi bag programmerne som overhovedet muligt.\nJeg vil specielt fremh\u00e6ve, at bet\u00e6nkningen omfatter et forslag fra Budgetudvalget, som skal sikre, at Kommissionen kan bevilge en grundl\u00e6ggende finansiering for to \u00e5r ad gangen gennem rammeaftaler for partnerskab. Det skulle gerne sikre, at de f\u00e6rreste midler g\u00e5r til bureaukrati, og de fleste midler g\u00e5r til en forst\u00e6rket indsats p\u00e5 de omr\u00e5der, som vi er enige om. Med disse ord vil jeg gerne endnu en gang sige tak til hr. Trakatellis for hans store indsats og h\u00e5be, at det virkelig lykkes at sende et klart signal til Europas borgere om, at EU kan g\u00f8re en forskel til gavn for os alle sammen p\u00e5 dette omr\u00e5de.", "agenda_item": "Community action programme in the field of health (2007-2013) (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060316-ITEM-005", "intervention_id": "4-021", "summary_english": "```json\n{\n  \"headline\": \"Strong Support for EU Health Programme with Emphasis on Reduced Bureaucracy and Two-Year Core Funding\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"The speaker addresses the Community action programme in the field of health (2007-2013), highlighting the need for cross-border health cooperation and efficient funding mechanisms.
