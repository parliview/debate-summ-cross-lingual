{"speaker": "Christofer Fjellner (PPE-DE).", "english": "Christofer Fjellner (PPE-DE). \u2013 (SV) Mr\u00a0President, I have expressed quite a few views on the Commission\u2019s health programme and kicked up a bit of a fuss. I do think, however, that it is really commendable, and I therefore wish to thank not only Mr\u00a0Kyprianou but also Mr\u00a0Trakatellis.\nIt has been self-evident to me that health is primarily an issue for the Member States, and I am delighted that the majority in this Chamber are of the same view. What we do at EU level needs to provide clear added value to patients. There are three aspects of this subject that I have been involved in and fought for and that I particularly want to emphasise today. First of all, there is the point of departure for this report, which is, and always must be, that the individual\u2019s own commitment to his or her own health is what is most important. Where health care and work in the public health field are concerned, we politicians must always regard people, even if they happen to be ill, as adults with rights and duties, including the right to control their own lives and health care. We must never forget that active involvement in our own health is always the best medicine. That is precisely what is so unfortunate about the fact that the Social Democrats wish to remove the wordings designed to promote just such active involvement in our own health.\nAs Members of the European Parliament, we must also facilitate movement within and between countries so that everyone can seek the treatment and care they themselves most believe in. At present, those who enjoy least freedom of movement in the EU are those who need it most, that is to say the patients. For them, Europe\u2019s borders become little Berlin Walls standing in the way of their ability to obtain treatment. For them, freedom of movement may be a matter of life or death. We must not believe that the most important aspects of the good society can be regulated and organised using the planned economy, which has so clearly proved to be the economic model most destructive of creativity and sound housekeeping. We must have more freedom of choice and of movement.\nWe must also make efforts to ensure that we as decision-makers, together with those who implement the decisions and, in particular, those who use health services obtain better access to information from those services. We must be able to compare results and not only, as at present, costs. These developments are needed not only so that we might learn from each other but also so that users might take advantage of the freedom of movement and of choice given to them by the European Court of Justice. These developments would be to the advantage of European patients.\nUp until about the time of the Second World War, people coming into contact with health services were victims. More often than not, they were healthier before the doctor was called than after. Through the development of treatment methods and the advent of drugs, we have become patients in our health care systems. I am, however, convinced that, within the not too distant future, we shall be health care consumers, and that is a shift in perspective that we must help bring about: victims yesterday, patients today and health care consumers tomorrow. That would be a fantastic development that I believe would make us not only healthier but also freer.", "lang": "SV", "original": "Christofer Fjellner (PPE-DE). \u2013 Herr talman! Jag har haft flera synpunkter p\u00e5 kommissionens h\u00e4lsoplan och jag har br\u00e5kat en del, men jag tycker att det har blivit riktigt bra och d\u00e4rf\u00f6r vill jag tacka dels Kyprianou, men ocks\u00e5 Trakatellis.\nAtt h\u00e4lsa fr\u00e4mst \u00e4r en fr\u00e5ga f\u00f6r medlemsstaterna har f\u00f6r mig varit sj\u00e4lvklart. Jag gl\u00e4der mig \u00e5t att majoriteten av kammaren \u00e4r av samma uppfattning. Det vi g\u00f6r p\u00e5 EU-niv\u00e5 ska ge ett tydligt merv\u00e4rde f\u00f6r patienterna. H\u00e4r finns det tre omr\u00e5den som jag har varit med och slagits f\u00f6r och som jag s\u00e4rskilt vill lyfta fram i dag. F\u00f6rst och fr\u00e4mst g\u00e4ller det utg\u00e5ngspunkten f\u00f6r detta bet\u00e4nkande, som \u00e4r och alltid m\u00e5ste vara att individens eget engagemang i sin egen h\u00e4lsa \u00e4r viktigast. D\u00e4rf\u00f6r m\u00e5ste vi politiker, i sjukv\u00e5rden och i folkh\u00e4lsoarbetet, alltid betrakta medborgarna, \u00e4ven om de r\u00e5kar vara sjuka, som vuxna m\u00e4nniskor \u2013 med r\u00e4ttigheter och skyldigheter. Med r\u00e4tten att styra sina egna liv och sin egen sjukv\u00e5rd. Vi f\u00e5r aldrig gl\u00f6mma att det egna engagemanget i den egna h\u00e4lsan alltid \u00e4r den b\u00e4sta medicinen. Det \u00e4r just d\u00e4rf\u00f6r tr\u00e5kigt att socialdemokraterna vill stryka de formuleringar som syftar just p\u00e5 eget engagemang i sin egen h\u00e4lsa.\nSom Europaparlamentariker m\u00e5ste vi ocks\u00e5 underl\u00e4tta r\u00f6rligheten inom och mellan l\u00e4nderna, s\u00e5 att alla kan s\u00f6ka den behandling och den v\u00e5rd de sj\u00e4lva tror p\u00e5 mest. I dag \u00e4r den fria r\u00f6rligheten i EU minst f\u00f6r dem som beh\u00f6ver den mest, dvs. patienterna. F\u00f6r dem blir gr\u00e4nserna i Europa till sm\u00e5 Berlinmurar som st\u00e5r i v\u00e4gen f\u00f6r deras m\u00f6jlighet att f\u00e5 behandling. F\u00f6r dem kan den fria r\u00f6rligheten vara en fr\u00e5ga om liv och d\u00f6d. Vi skall inte tro att de viktigaste delarna av det goda samh\u00e4llet kan regleras och organiseras med planekonomi, som s\u00e5 tydligt har visat sig vara den ekonomiska modell som \u00e4r mest f\u00f6r\u00f6dande f\u00f6r skaparkraft och hush\u00e5llning. Vi m\u00e5ste ha mer valfrihet och r\u00f6rlighet.\nVi m\u00e5ste ocks\u00e5 arbeta f\u00f6r att f\u00e5 b\u00e4ttre tillg\u00e5ng till information fr\u00e5n sjukv\u00e5rden. Till oss som beslutsfattare, till utf\u00f6rarna och inte minst till anv\u00e4ndarna. Vi m\u00e5ste kunna j\u00e4mf\u00f6ra utfall, och inte bara som i dag kostnaderna. Det beh\u00f6vs dels f\u00f6r att man ska kunna l\u00e4ra av varandra men ocks\u00e5 f\u00f6r att anv\u00e4ndarna ska kunna anv\u00e4nda sig av den r\u00f6rlighet och valfrihet som EG-domstolen har gett dem. Det \u00e4r till f\u00f6rm\u00e5n f\u00f6r Europas patienter.\nFram till andra v\u00e4rldskriget ungef\u00e4r var man ett offer n\u00e4r man kom i kontakt med sjukv\u00e5rden. Man var oftast friskare innan l\u00e4karen tillkallades \u00e4n efter. Genom att behandlingsmetoder har utvecklats och l\u00e4kemedel har tillkommit s\u00e5 har vi blivit patienter i v\u00e5rdsystemet. Men jag \u00e4r \u00f6vertygad om att vi inom en snar framtid kommer att vara sjukv\u00e5rdskonsumenter, och detta perspektivskifte m\u00e5ste vi bidra till att skapa.
