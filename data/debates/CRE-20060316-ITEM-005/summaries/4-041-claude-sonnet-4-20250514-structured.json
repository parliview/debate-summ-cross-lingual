{"speaker": "Carl Schlyter (Verts/ALE). \u2013", "english": "Carl Schlyter (Verts/ALE). \u2013 (SV) Mr\u00a0President, I should like to thank both Mr\u00a0Trakatellis and Mr\u00a0Kyprianou, who have done a sterling job. We are, however, in an absurd situation in which we spend five times more money on tobacco subsidies than on promoting public health, that is to say five times more money on ruining people\u2019s health than on improving it.\nWhat I like is the fact that this report focuses on preventive work. Resources are so limited that they are only sufficient for the purposes of cooperation, sharing good examples and disseminating information. However, it is at national level that the big money is to be found and where the bulk of the work will take place. What I think is good about the European Parliament\u2019s changes is Amendment\u00a053, the importance of which I want to emphasise. Since there is so little money, it should not go to organisations that lobby, openly or otherwise, on behalf of the pharmaceutical industry. It is good that there would be careful monitoring to ensure that that did not happen.\nWe have not so far mentioned Amendments\u00a092 and 144, which deal with gender equality. I think that this is an important aspect, which we must consider. Too large a portion of the available money goes to men and men\u2019s health care and too little to women\u2019s health care. However, it is in the relationship between public health and trade that Europe can make the biggest contribution in this area. The Treaty\u2019s articles on public health are scarcely applied at all to trade policy. Where is the health dimension in alcohol policy? The same applies to chemicals and pesticides. It is in these areas that the really big efforts must be made.\nCommissioner, you can make an initial contribution to bringing about that more comprehensive view by not approving the eight new pesticides that are coming on the scene and that are biopersistent, endocrine disruptive and class 2 carcinogenic \u2013 a wordy enumeration of the perfect reasons for banning chemicals. You can take the opportunity to do so now.", "lang": "SV", "original": "Carl Schlyter (Verts/ALE). \u2013 Herr talman! Tack till b\u00e5de Trakatellis och Kyprianou. Ni har gjort ett gott arbete. Men vi befinner oss i en absurd situation n\u00e4r vi ger fem g\u00e5nger mer pengar till tobakst\u00f6d \u00e4n till att fr\u00e4mja h\u00e4lsa.

Det \u00e4r bra att det noggrant kontrolleras att s\u00e5 inte blir fallet.\n\u00c4ndringsf\u00f6rslag 92 och 144, som handlar om j\u00e4mst\u00e4lldheten har vi inte n\u00e4mnt hittills. Jag tycker det \u00e4r en viktig aspekt som vi m\u00e5ste beakta. F\u00f6r stor del av pengarna g\u00e5r till m\u00e4n och m\u00e4ns sjukv\u00e5rd och f\u00f6r lite g\u00e5r till kvinnors sjukv\u00e5rd.
