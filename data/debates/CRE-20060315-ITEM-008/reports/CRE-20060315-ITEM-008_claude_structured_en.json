Mr President, in the western Balkans the EU can really make a difference. This was discussed at the Foreign Ministers\u2019 \u2018Gymnich\u2019 meeting in Salzburg.\nThe region is at the crossroads and the EU will guide it down the peaceful and reformist path. We have seen many positive developments in recent years, but we should not be lulled into a false sense of security.\nThis year the remaining status issues, Kosovo and Montenegro, must be solved with patience and determination. We must also move the region beyond the era of war. We must thus clear the way for progress on issues that really matter to the citizens of the region: economic and social development and bringing the countries into the European mainstream.\nHow can we best encourage the countries to stick to an ambitious reform agenda? Most importantly, we must stick to our commitment that the countries can make progress towards the EU with membership as the ultimate goal, once they have managed to meet the rigorous accession criteria. Moreover, we must strive to make this perspective concrete and tangible, as the Commission has done in its recent communication. Let me mention a few examples of our concrete objectives and proposals.\nFirstly, we should remove obstacles to trade, production and investment. The Commission, together with the stability pact and the countries concerned, is pursuing the creation of a regional free trade agreement, which would replace the existing patchwork of 31 bilateral free trade agreements. This may be attained through a simultaneous enlargement and modernisation of CEFTA, on which there will be a CEFTA summit meeting in April in Bucharest.\nSecondly, we should \u2018Europeanise\u2019 the next generation \u2013 or why not the current generation? That is why we have proposed increasing the mobility of researchers and students by increasing the number of scholarships provided for them.\nThirdly, we need to facilitate people-to-people contacts. We shall put forward measures on visa facilitation, and I trust that the Member States will move them quickly forward through the Council, so that we can start negotiations on visa facilitation and readmission agreements. Let me underline the fact that the more the countries in the region can do to ensure border controls and document security, the easier it will be to convince the EU Member States to make progress on visa facilitation.\nI am glad that the EU\u2019s Foreign Ministers in Salzburg last weekend endorsed these practical measures and, even though she is not present today, I want to pay particular tribute to Mrs Plassnik and her personal commitment to ensuring progress in the western Balkans.\nFinally, I must say a few words about the death of Slobodan Milosevic. When we received the news of his death at the end of the Gymnich meeting, my immediate reaction was to remember my visit to Srebrenica last July, at the tenth commemoration of the most appalling massacre in post-war Europe. I regret that Milosevic died before justice could be served for the hundreds of thousands of victims of the crimes for which he was indicted.\nIn his memoirs, Chancellor Kohl writes that each generation must work for a necessary consciousness of history to avoid repeating our mistakes and to ensure that \u2018the voices of victims are heard\u2019. These are very wise words.\nThe International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia is putting on record evidence that will help the Serbs of current and future generations to understand that many crimes were committed in the name of Serbia, while certain individuals were responsible for these crimes.\nThe death of Milosevic makes it even more important for The Hague Tribunal to complete its work and for the remaining indictees to be transferred there. This will help Serbia to close the tragic chapter of history over which Milosevic presided and to come to terms with the legacy of its past.\nToday Serbia is truly at the crossroads and I sincerely hope that the leaders and people of Serbia have the will and wisdom to choose the European future instead of the nationalist past. The country now truly holds its future in its own hands.

(DE) Mr President, I crave your forgiveness for our late arrival. We have just had two traffic accidents to contend with, one on the road to the airport in Vienna and one on the road from Entzheim.\nThank you for the opportunity to inform you about our informal, Gymnich-format, meeting of foreign ministers, which took place this weekend in Salzburg. This was primarily concerned with two subject areas, the first of which was the challenges to foreign policy currently facing us, notably the developments in the Middle East and the imminent elections in Belarus and Ukraine. The second day was devoted to the Balkans, the Thessaloniki agenda, its implementation and its future.\nIf you will permit me, I would like to discuss the Middle East first and then move on to the Balkans.\nTo the Middle East, then: this region is, following the elections to the Palestinian Legislative Council and in the run-up to the elections in Israel, in a transitional stage, one in which we have a very clear and consistent message to send to the future Palestinian Government, for we need to make clear what are our own fundamental principles, on the basis of which we are prepared for further cooperation. The fundamentals are perfectly clear and consist of three elements. We are calling upon them to abandon violence, to agree to negotiations \u2013 which means recognising the existing agreements \u2013 and to acknowledge Israel\u2019s right to existence.\nIt is on this clear and consistent basis that our policy is developed, and on which we have launched an appeal to our partners in the Middle East. Hamas, in particular, will have to become aware of the fork in the road and come to a decision as to which path it wants to take in future. It must make clear which route it is going to take; we have spelled out what the conditions are, and in no respect has there been any change in them. We shall continue to support the Palestinian people, and also took the opportunity at \u2018Gymnich\u2019 to discuss what shape financial support might take in future. What is clear is that any such support must benefit the Palestinian people rather than being used for terrorism or for violence.\nWe are, then, with a great deal of attention, following developments, the efforts being made to put together a new Palestinian Government, and its future programme. Yesterday, President Mahmud Abbas and his delegation visited Vienna, where we had the chance to raise these issues with him. He and the interim government have our support in this difficult period, and I shall be happy to discuss events in closer detail if I get the opportunity to do so later on.\nTurning to the Balkans, this issue was and is an important one for the Austrian Presidency, and I therefore regard the Gymnich meeting and its engagement with it as a message of encouragement, even in a dual sense of the term, addressed to the people of the states of the Western Balkans. The road they have to travel towards Europe and towards meeting European standards may well be a difficult one, but the journey is worth it, and on that road they have our good wishes and support.\nIt is also a sign to our own peoples, encouraging them in the belief that it is indeed possible to find solutions to difficult problems \u2013 even to the most difficult ones. I therefore see it as a sign of hope and confidence that we succeeded, in the Salzburg Declaration, in underlining and making visible the prospects that the Balkan states have of acceding to the European Union.\nFor it was important, particularly at a time when people are talking in terms of 'enlargement fatigue', that this signal should be sent out in order to give our partners a good idea of what to expect in view of the extremely difficult decisions that we will have to take in 2006. It was evident from the guest list for our Salzburg meeting just how much the path we shall take this year will demand of us, for our guests included Martti Ahtisaari, the UN special envoy to Kosovo, and his deputy Albert Rohan, and we were able to discuss with them the future of that region. We had also invited Christian Schwarz-Schilling, the High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina; S\u00f8ren Jensen-Petersen, the head of UNMIK was present with his delegation, as was Ibrahim Rugova\u2019s successor as President of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu. I was also pleased that this segment of our Salzburg meeting managed to achieve something of a \u2018first\u2019 in the presence of Mr Brok, the chairman of your Foreign Affairs Committee, who took part in our discussions.\nThe Balkans are at the heart of Europe, and without them, European unification will be incomplete. We know that the road ahead of us will be a difficult one, but we are determined to go down it. We have decided to take a step-by-step approach to the work in hand, working through the issues one by one and resolving each of them in turn.\nIt is working on the European standards that is actually the core issue for each and every one of these countries. Yesterday, the Bosnian Prime Minister visited me in Vienna, and told me that what was crucial was not a date or a particular point in time in the course of development, but working together on European standards. Javier Solana, who has been keeping an eye on developments for a long time, describes what has been achieved since Thessaloniki in 2003 as a success story capable of being read on the agenda, and, more specifically on the order of business for the Salzburg meeting, since the issues with which this meeting concerned itself were issues of easier and improved trading arrangement, the fight against organised crime, young people and the facilitation of easier travel. We gave attention to the visa issue in view of the need to address the expectations that the people of these countries have of us. We also, though, have to make clear to them what options are open to us, and join with them in seeking, step by step, solutions to the problems that remain outstanding in this area and elsewhere.\nThere is no doubt about it: Europe is making a difference in this region, but we have also emphasised the responsibility that the countries concerned have for themselves, for in some of them, which have already been stabilised, we need to move on to their dynamic Europeanisation. As we proceed down that road, it must be made clear to them that they need the willingness to take the necessary action and demonstrate that quality that is described so well by the English term \u2018ownership\u2019.\nWe have stressed the need for regional cooperation, especially in view of the work being done on a regional free trade area, with a single free trade agreement, based on CEFTA, intended to replace 31 individual agreements. Speaking personally, I am very grateful to Commissioner Rehn and to the Commission as a whole for their commitment to this. The Council and the Commission are working on this hand in hand and side by side in the best sense of the word. I wish to thank the Commission for its communication at the end of January, and also for their willingness to join us in continuing to work towards the achievement of the goals set out in the Salzburg statement.\nContinued work is also called for on the part of the ministers of the national government within their own remits, for it is they who, along with other things, will have to network with their partners in the Balkan states in addressing actual problems. The ministers of the interior, in particular, are highly committed to this and bear a great responsibility, for it is they and their cooperation that determine what practical headway can be made on important issues.\nWe also discussed the topic of the EU\u2019s assimilation capacity and explored its implications. As you know, this is a topic that I brought into greater prominence last autumn, and I believe I was right to do so, for we are not seeking to put up an additional obstacle, but, essentially, to make us more aware of something that ought to be quite obvious, that being that it is not only the candidates for accession of whom homework is to be demanded, but the European Union itself also needs to do its own.\nAt this joint meeting, at a moment at which all of us were united around one table in Salzburg, we all had an experience that was not only disquieting but also, at the same time, gave us a sense of hopeful confidence: our deliberations were interrupted by news of the death of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107, and there was a European symbolism in our being able, at such a moment, to work on our common European future.\n(Applause)", "lang": "EN", "original": "Ursula Plassnik, President-in-Office of the Council .

We have decided to take a step-by-step approach to the work in hand, working through the issues one by one and resolving each of them in turn.\nIt is working on the European standards that is actually the core issue for each and every one of these countries. Yesterday, the Bosnian Prime Minister visited me in Vienna, and told me that what was crucial was not a date or a particular point in time in the course of development, but working together on European standards. Javier Solana, who has been keeping an eye on developments for a long time, describes what has been achieved since Thessaloniki in 2003 as a success story capable of being read on the agenda, and, more specifically on the order of business for the Salzburg meeting, since the issues with which this meeting concerned itself were issues of easier and improved trading arrangement, the fight against organised crime, young people and the facilitation of easier travel. We gave attention to the visa issue in view of the need to address the expectations that the people of these countries have of us. We also, though, have to make clear to them what options are open to us, and join with them in seeking, step by step, solutions to the problems that remain outstanding in this area and elsewhere.\nThere is no doubt about it: Europe is making a difference in this region, but we have also emphasised the responsibility that the countries concerned have for themselves, for in some of them, which have already been stabilised, we need to move on to their dynamic Europeanisation. As we proceed down that road, it must be made clear to them that they need the willingness to take the necessary action and demonstrate that quality that is described so well by the English term \u2018ownership\u2019.\nWe have stressed the need for regional cooperation, especially in view of the work being done on a regional free trade area, with a single free trade agreement, based on CEFTA, intended to replace 31 individual agreements. Speaking personally, I am very grateful to Commissioner Rehn and to the Commission as a whole for their commitment to this. The Council and the Commission are working on this hand in hand and side by side in the best sense of the word. I wish to thank the Commission for its communication at the end of January, and also for their willingness to join us in continuing to work towards the achievement of the goals set out in the Salzburg statement.\nContinued work is also called for on the part of the ministers of the national government within their own remits, for it is they who, along with other things, will have to network with their partners in the Balkan states in addressing actual problems. The ministers of the interior, in particular, are highly committed to this and bear a great responsibility, for it is they and their cooperation that determine what practical headway can be made on important issues.\nWe also discussed the topic of the EU\u2019s assimilation capacity and explored its implications. As you know, this is a topic that I brought into greater prominence last autumn, and I believe I was right to do so, for we are not seeking to put up an additional obstacle, but, essentially, to make us more aware of something that ought to be quite obvious, that being that it is not only the candidates for accession of whom homework is to be demanded, but the European Union itself also needs to do its own.\nAt this joint meeting, at a moment at which all of us were united around one table in Salzburg, we all had an experience that was not only disquieting but also, at the same time, gave us a sense of hopeful confidence: our deliberations were interrupted by news of the death of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107, and there was a European symbolism in our being able, at such a moment, to work on our common European future.\n(Applause)", "agenda_item": "Results of the informal Council of foreign ministers (10-11 March 2006) (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060315-ITEM-008", "intervention_id": "3-215", "summary_english": "{\"headline\": \"Austrian Council Presidency Reports on Middle East Challenges and Balkan Integration Progress Following Foreign Ministers Meeting\",\n\"issueSum\": \"The speech addresses two main areas: Middle East developments following Palestinian Legislative Council elections and upcoming Israeli elections, particularly regarding Hamas and the future Palestinian government; and Balkan integration challenges, including Kosovo's future status, Bosnia and Herzegovina developments, and the broader Western Balkans European integration process amid concerns about 'enlargement fatigue'.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"The speaker strongly supports conditional engagement with the future Palestinian government based on three non-negotiable principles: abandoning violence, agreeing to negotiations (recognizing existing agreements), and acknowledging Israel's right to exist.

Firstly, we are right to demand that Hamas should face up to reality and renounce violence, but that must not be licence for Israel to continue with its policy of unilateral violence, which is what we have just seen it engaging in. Secondly, Europe, and the USA, must be consistent in their nuclear policies, particularly in view of the different ways in which India and Iran are being treated, and the International Atomic Energy Authority in Vienna must be given a larger role in a multilateral system of uranium enrichment and nuclear waste management. If we stick with these principles, we will make progress.\nTurning to the Balkans, it strikes me that our actions are being guided by the principle that progress is to be defined as whatever is not regress. I have to say that my group and I are very embarrassed by the conduct of certain Member States, which are making themselves culpable for the way in which the business of making Europe fit for the accession of new Member States is being played off against the Balkan countries\u2019 prospects of accession. Europe will not, however, be made any stronger by the Balkan countries being robbed of their prospects of accession or seeing them deferred to the distant future. The guiding principle must still be the vision of EU membership, for which this House \u2013 my group included \u2013 has so often voted unanimously. Perfectly understandable though it is that demand should be made for the EU to be made more capable of welcoming new members \u2013 I am thinking here of the constitution and of the financial basis \u2013 this cannot be used against the countries of South-Eastern Europe and as a means of fending off their efforts at accession. Preparations for this on our side and in the Balkans must run in parallel. The preparation of both sides must be consistent and thorough, and while it is in progress, practical action needs to be taken to prepare the countries of the Balkans for accession to the European Union, not least by making visa arrangements simpler and easier. Further to what you had to say about the ministers of the interior \u2013 Mrs Gottes and Mr Ohr \u2013 I hope that they will do something tangible in order to give this region\u2019s young people, in particular, a chance to get to know Europe at last. Despite Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107\u2019s death \u2013 which was in many respects premature \u2013 it remains in the interests of the victims and of Europe\u2019s shared future that all those who committed crimes should be brought to The Hague for trial, and on that we must certainly insist.\nThe countries of the Balkans, which have so often in the course of our continent\u2019s history been the playthings of the European Great Powers, must progressively be integrated into the European Union. We will not, in any case, accept their being relegated to an earlier stage of their relationship with it. When, tomorrow, we vote to adopt the Brok report, we must do so stating clearly only that which is in the text, and without the interpretations that have, regrettably, been placed upon it in the last few hours and have the effect of falsifying what it actually contains. We defend the Balkan countries\u2019 prospects of membership of the European Union.\n(Applause)", "lang": "DE", "original": "Hannes Swoboda, im Namen der PSE-Fraktion . \u2013 Herr Pr\u00e4sident, Frau Ratspr\u00e4sidentin, Herr Kommissar! Ich m\u00f6chte nur zwei kurze Bemerkungen betreffend den Nahen Osten machen. Erstens fordern wir mit Recht, dass die Hamas die Realit\u00e4ten anerkennen und der Gewalt abschw\u00f6ren muss. Aber das darf kein Freibrief f\u00fcr Israel sein, seine einseitige Gewaltpolitik fortzusetzen, wie wir dies soeben erlebt haben. Zweitens: Die Nuklearpolitik Europas und der USA muss auf eine koh\u00e4rente Basis gebracht werden, vor allem angesichts unterschiedlicher Behandlung Indiens und Irans. Zweitens muss der Internationalen Atomenergiebeh\u00f6rde in Wien eine gr\u00f6\u00dfere Rolle in einem multilateralen System der Urananreicherung und der Entsorgung des Atomm\u00fclls gegeben werden. Wenn wir uns an diese Grunds\u00e4tze halten, werden sich Fortschritte einstellen.\nWas den Balkan betrifft, handeln wir, wie mir scheint, nach dem Motto \u201eWas kein R\u00fcckschritt ist, ist schon ein Fortschritt\u201c. Es ist die Schuld einiger Mitgliedstaaten \u2013 ich und auch meine Fraktion sind sehr betroffen davon\u00a0\u2013, dass man die Frage der Ert\u00fcchtigung Europas zur Aufnahme gegen eine Beitrittsperspektive f\u00fcr die L\u00e4nder des Balkans ausspielt. Aber Europa wird nicht stark, indem wir den L\u00e4ndern des Balkans die Beitrittsperspektive rauben oder in weite Ferne r\u00fccken. Die Vision der EU-Mitgliedschaft, die dieses Parlament so oft und auch meine Fraktion einstimmig beschlossen hat, muss die Richtschnur bleiben. Die selbstverst\u00e4ndliche Forderung nach Erh\u00f6hung der Aufnahmef\u00e4higkeit der EU \u2013 ich denke an die Verfassung, an die finanzielle Basis \u2013 kann und darf nicht gegen die Beitrittsbestrebungen der L\u00e4nder S\u00fcdosteuropas gewandt und ausgespielt werden. Wir m\u00fcssen die Vorbereitungen auf unserer Seite und die Vorbereitungen auf dem Balkan parallel f\u00fchren. W\u00e4hrend diese konsequente Vorbereitung beider Seiten auf die Erweiterung geschieht, m\u00fcssen konkrete Schritte gesetzt werden, um die L\u00e4nder des Balkans an die Europ\u00e4ische Union heranzuf\u00fchren, nicht zuletzt auch durch deutliche Erleichterungen im Visa-Regime. Ihre Worte \u00fcber die Innenminister in Gottes oder auch der Innenminister Ohr \u2013 ich hoffe, dass sie etwas Konkretes tun, um vor allem den jungen Menschen in dieser Region eine Chance zu geben, endlich auch Europa kennen zu lernen. Trotz des in mehrfacher Hinsicht vorzeitigen Todes von Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 bleibt im Interesse der Opfer und der gemeinsamen Zukunft Europas die Aufgabe, alle T\u00e4ter nach Den Haag zu bringen. Darauf m\u00fcssen wir sicherlich beharren.\nDie L\u00e4nder des Balkans, die so oft in der Geschichte unseres Kontinents Spielb\u00e4lle der europ\u00e4ischen Gro\u00dfm\u00e4chte waren, m\u00fcssen Schritt f\u00fcr Schritt in die Europ\u00e4ische Union integriert werden. Wir jedenfalls werden keine R\u00fcckstufung der Balkanl\u00e4nder in ein fr\u00fcheres Stadium ihrer N\u00e4he zur Europ\u00e4ischen Union akzeptieren. Wenn wir morgen dem Bericht Brok zustimmen, dann nur mit dieser eindeutigen Aussage, die im Text steht, und nicht mit Interpretationen, wie sie leider in den letzten Stunden immer wieder gegeben werden, die den eigentlichen Text des Berichts Brok jedoch verf\u00e4lschen.

I would like to say something briefly about the Middle East.\nWe find ourselves in ever-greater difficulties, as a result not only of developments over the past few days, but of those that have taken place over recent weeks and months. On the one hand, there is the situation with which both sides in the Holy Land itself are presenting us; on the other, there is the issue of how probable it is that Iran will be deterred from a military nuclear programme. And if, as is indeed possible, there is a closing of the circle \u2013 with Iran, Syria, a multilateral agreement in Lebanon with Hisbollah and contacts with Hamas \u2013 there arises the great danger of an alliance that is highly problematic and to which we have to find a response, not only in order to secure peace and fight terrorism, but also to guarantee the security of our energy supplies.\nI am grateful, Madam President-in-Office, for having been able to be present for some of the discussions. Whilst the negotiations will see us tackling hard political facts, we must also ensure that there is a real dialogue of cultures, so that the fundamentalists will be unable to prevent the moderates \u2013 who are present in all the regions \u2013 from forming a majority.\nPerhaps, Madam President-in-Office, I might be permitted to address another aspect of great significance in some areas, that being the issue of the European Union\u2019s mission to the Congo. I would be very interested to know whether there is already a mandate in place for this, setting out what it is to do and for how long and over what geographical area it is to do it, and whether the Congolese authorities have officially invited such a project and the European Union\u2019s participation in it.

It is also good that, in the end, the decision has been taken to use CEFTA, which already exists and is already up and running, as a basis for doing this instead of creating something new, as there was talk of doing previously. I think that this was an extremely wise decision. At the same time, we are also talking about different countries with different traditions, different histories and different degrees of development. It is therefore important that we keep sending out the message that all these countries are welcome to apply for membership of the European Community if they wish to do so and that, in that case, they will be treated on their own merits. There is at present a concern in certain quarters that we wish to lump the countries together again and that they will be treated as a unit. I believe that that anxiety is exaggerated, but it is very important to be extremely clear on the point that has been made, namely that each country is to be treated on its own merits.\nWith regard to the death of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107, we are talking here about an odious dictator, responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people and a large part of the tragedy that has taken place. I also regret that the trial could not be brought to a conclusion, and it was, I believe, an obviously quite pathetic man who ended his days.

They have therefore gone further than the Thessaloniki declaration of 2003, which talked about the great challenge represented by the integration of the five countries of the Balkans and their eventual accession to the Union. The MEPs from the UMP agree with this vision and this prospect and are convinced that, without the Balkans, European unification is not complete. They also share the view that it will be a long journey with many obstacles along the way, but first of all they would ask that, in relation to the Balkans and any other possible future enlargement, the real questions be set out clearly. What are the real questions? Firstly, does the European Union have the capacity to absorb these countries? I would point out that this is one of the Copenhagen criteria, a criterion that is too often forgotten; financial capacity, institutional capacity, but also political capacity.

Debate Information\n\n**Title:** Results of the informal Council of foreign ministers (10-11 March 2006)  \n**Date:** March 2006 (following the 10-11 March 2006 Council meeting)  \n**Number of Contributions:** 28 speakers participated in the debate  \n**Topic:** Discussion of outcomes from the informal Foreign Ministers Council meeting, covering Western Balkans integration, Middle East policy (particularly Palestine-Israel situation and Iran), and EU enlargement policy\n\n## 2. Executive Summary\n\n### Western Balkans Integration Policy\n\nThe debate revealed significant tensions regarding EU enlargement to the Western Balkans. **Commissioner Olli Rehn** strongly advocated for maintaining credible EU membership prospects, stating \"Most importantly, we must stick to our commitment that the countries can make progress towards the EU with membership as the ultimate goal, once they have managed to meet the rigorous accession criteria\" [Rehn, March 2006]. He proposed concrete measures including a regional free trade agreement through CEFTA enlargement and visa facilitation.\n\nHowever, several MEPs criticized the Salzburg statement from the recent Balkans conference. **Annemie Neyts-Uyttebroeck** expressed disappointment, noting \"I had hoped that a strong and positive message would have come out of the Balkan Conference\" [Neyts-Uyttebroeck, March 2006]. **Angelika Beer** was more direct in her criticism of Austria's presidency, arguing that \"The statement is a compromise, one, insubstantial though it is, that is given a critical hearing in the Balkans and was in no way a sign of encouragement\" [Beer, March 2006].\n\n**Austrian Council President Ursula Plassnik** defended the Salzburg outcomes, rejecting \"the idea that the Salzburg statement was a superficial compromise\" and emphasizing that \"The Balkans are at the heart of Europe, and without them, European unification will be incomplete\" [Plassnik, March 2006].\n\nThe absorption capacity debate emerged prominently, with **Margie Sudre** calling for clarity on \"the EU's capacity to absorb these countries,\" noting this as \"one of the Copenhagen criteria, a criterion that is too often forgotten\" [Sudre, March 2006]. **Hannes Swoboda** warned against \"robbing Balkan countries of their prospects of accession or seeing them deferred to the distant future\" [Swoboda, March 2006].\n\n### Middle East Policy\n\nThe Palestinian situation following Hamas's electoral victory dominated Middle East discussions. Most speakers agreed on maintaining three conditions for EU support: Hamas must renounce violence, recognize Israel's right to exist, and accept previous agreements. \n\n**Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Salafranca S\u00e1nchez-Neyra** strongly condemned Israeli actions in Jericho prison, stating the assault \"has unleashed a wave of indiscriminate violence which has harmed European Union citizens and interests and which we must condemn in the strongest terms\" [Salafranca, March 2006].\n\n**Silvana Koch-Mehrin** took the hardest line against continued EU financial support, arguing \"The EU must not distance itself from it in any way. That is why I believe the EU is making a grave mistake in continuing to give the interim government financial support\" [Koch-Mehrin, March 2006].\n\n**Ursula Plassnik** emphasized that while humanitarian aid would continue, \"such aid can be effective only in a peaceful environment, and all parties must play their part in creating one\" [Plassnik, March 2006].\n\n### Iran Nuclear Issue\n\nIran's nuclear program received less detailed discussion but remained a concern. **Elmar Brok** warned of \"the great danger of an alliance that is highly problematic\" involving Iran, Syria, Lebanon, and Hamas, threatening \"not only to secure peace and fight terrorism, but also to guarantee the security of our energy supplies\" [Brok, March 2006].\n\n**Hannes Swoboda** called for consistent nuclear policies and greater IAEA involvement in multilateral uranium enrichment, while **Bernd Posselt** advocated for \"a combination of stringency and intense diplomatic effort\" toward Iran [Posselt, March 2006].\n\n### Key Divisions and Proposals\n\nThe debate revealed a fundamental divide between those supporting immediate, clear EU membership commitments to the Balkans and those advocating for slower, more conditional approaches based on EU absorption capacity concerns. The French position, represented by **Sudre**, called for defining \"Europe's geographical borders\" before further enlargement commitments.\n\nPractical proposals included establishing a regional free trade area through CEFTA modernization, implementing visa facilitation measures, increasing educational exchanges, and maintaining justice processes through the International Criminal Tribunal. On the Middle East, there was broad consensus on the three-condition framework for Hamas but disagreement over the extent of continued EU financial support.\n\nThe debate ultimately highlighted ongoing tensions between EU enlargement ambitions and capacity concerns, while demonstrating broad agreement on maintaining firm conditions for Middle East engagement despite tactical differences on implementation.", "src_model": "claude", "model_type": "claude", "model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "structured": true, "incremental": false, "hierarchical": false, "grouped": false, "shuffle": false, "prompt": false, "lang": "english"}
