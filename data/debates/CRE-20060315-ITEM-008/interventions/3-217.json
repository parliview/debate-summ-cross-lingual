{"speaker": "Annemie Neyts-Uyttebroeck,", "english": "Annemie Neyts-Uyttebroeck, on behalf of the ALDE Group . \u2013 Mr President, I had hoped that a strong and positive message would have come out of the Balkan Conference. I believe that was also the hope of both the Presidency-in-Office and the Commission. You each can ill afford to voice your disappointment, so I will do it for you.\nWe all acknowledge that the entire Balkan region remains volatile and potentially unstable, which is why clarity is absolutely indispensable. The joint press statement, notably weaker than previous declarations, states that the future of the western Balkans lies in the European Union. We note the absence of any mention of membership. It adds that a debate on enlargement strategy is due in 2006 and that the EU\u2019s absorption capacity has to be taken into account. That is disappointing. I will come back to that during the debate on the Brok report.\nAllow me to comment on the Middle East. I fully share my group chairman\u2019s reaction to the deplorable and unacceptable behaviour of Israel in Jericho yesterday, not to mention the strange behaviour \u2013 to say the least \u2013 of US and British troops. Needless to say, that action makes the EU\u2019s position more difficult. While my group strongly agrees that Hamas must renounce violence and endorse existing international treaties and agreements, we must note with sadness that Israel is making it increasingly difficult to hold this line. We will nevertheless do so, but we must also make it very clear that actions like those witnessed yesterday run totally counter to the search for a peaceful outcome.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Annemie Neyts-Uyttebroeck, on behalf of the ALDE Group . \u2013 Mr President, I had hoped that a strong and positive message would have come out of the Balkan Conference.
