We do all have an interest in the region being stabilised and democratised, and the EU really has an opportunity to play an important role. I wish you both good luck in the task of raising the ambitions of your colleagues in the other Member States to the same high level. Be assured that the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is with you on this.\nThe various initiatives for getting the countries to cooperate with each other and with ourselves are excellent. It is also good that, in the end, the decision has been taken to use CEFTA, which already exists and is already up and running, as a basis for doing this instead of creating something new, as there was talk of doing previously. I think that this was an extremely wise decision. At the same time, we are also talking about different countries with different traditions, different histories and different degrees of development. It is therefore important that we keep sending out the message that all these countries are welcome to apply for membership of the European Community if they wish to do so and that, in that case, they will be treated on their own merits. There is at present a concern in certain quarters that we wish to lump the countries together again and that they will be treated as a unit. I believe that that anxiety is exaggerated, but it is very important to be extremely clear on the point that has been made, namely that each country is to be treated on its own merits.\nWith regard to the death of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107, we are talking here about an odious dictator, responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people and a large part of the tragedy that has taken place. I also regret that the trial could not be brought to a conclusion, and it was, I believe, an obviously quite pathetic man who ended his days. We must still be crystal clear about the need for Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladi\u0107 to be extradited and to be so right now.

Jag \u00f6nskar er b\u00e5da lycka till i arbetet att f\u00e5 med era kollegor i de andra medlemsl\u00e4nderna p\u00e5 samma h\u00f6ga ambitionsniv\u00e5.

Jag tycker att det \u00e4r ett v\u00e4ldigt klokt beslut. Samtidigt handlar det ocks\u00e5 olika l\u00e4nder med olika traditioner, olika historia och olika grad av utveckling.

Det finns i\u00a0dag i vissa l\u00e4ger en oro \u00f6ver att vi vill bunta ihop l\u00e4nderna igen och att de kommer behandlas som ett kollektiv. Jag tror den oron \u00e4r \u00f6verdriven, men det \u00e4r v\u00e4ldigt viktigt att vara mycket, mycket tydlig p\u00e5 den punkten, att varje land behandlas p\u00e5 egna meriter.\nVad g\u00e4ller Slobodan Milosevics d\u00f6d s\u00e5 var han en vidrig diktator, ansvarig f\u00f6r hundratusentals m\u00e4nniskors liv och stora delar av den tragedi som har utspelat sig. Jag beklagar ocks\u00e5 att r\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngen inte kunde slutf\u00f6ras och jag tror att det var uppenbart att det var en ganska patetisk man som slutade sina dagar.
