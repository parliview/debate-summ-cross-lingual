The user provided a parliamentary debate summary and wants the main points from a specific speaker, \"President.\" But wait, the debate summary mentions several speakers like Commissioner Olli Rehn, Annemie Neyts-Uyttebroeck, Angelika Beer, Ursula Plassnik, etc. However, the user is asking about \"President.\" \n\nLooking at the debate summary, there's a mention of \"Austrian Council President Ursula Plassnik\" and \"President\" might refer to her. But the user's instruction says to only include points attributed to the speaker named. The problem is, in the provided debate summary, there's no direct mention of a \"President\" other than Ursula Plassnik, who is the Austrian Council President. However, the user's input might have a typo or refer to her as \"President.\"\n\nBut the user's query says \"Speaker Name: President.\" So I need to check if there's any contribution from a speaker named \"President\" in the debate summary. Scanning through the summary, the only president mentioned is Ursula Plassnik as the Austrian Council President. However, the user might be referring to her as \"President.\" \n\nBut the user's instruction says to only include arguments from the specified speaker. If the speaker's name is \"President,\" but in the debate, the actual speaker is Ursula Plassnik, then perhaps the user made a mistake. However, the user might have intended \"President\" as the speaker's title. \n\nIn the debate summary, Ursula Plassnik's contributions are mentioned. She defended the Salzburg statement, emphasized the importance of the Balkans to Europe, and talked about humanitarian aid in the Middle East. However, the user's query says \"President,\" so maybe the answer is that there are no points attributed to the speaker named \"President,\" hence an empty string.\n\nBut wait, the user might have intended \"President\" as a title, not a name. The problem is the user's input says \"Speaker Name: President.\" So if the actual speaker's name is not \"President\" but someone else, like Ursula Plassnik, then there's no contribution from a speaker named \"President.\" Therefore, the response should be an empty JSON.\n\nBut I need to check the debate summary again. The summary mentions \"Austrian Council President Ursula Plassnik\" and her statements. However, the user's speaker name is \"President,\" not her full name. So unless the speaker's name in the debate was actually \"President,\" which is unlikely, there's no contribution.

de las Naciones Unidas, si la Comisi\u00f3n prefiere un enfoque gradual, es decir, que el Consejo de Seguridad emita una declaraci\u00f3n, o espera que aplique sanciones.\nRespecto de la ampliaci\u00f3n, me gustar\u00eda saber, se\u00f1or Presidente, habida cuenta de las declaraciones que ha hecho el Ministro del Interior franc\u00e9s, se\u00f1or Sarkozy, de que hay una cierta fatiga

His position is a strong condemnation of those actions. The argument is that the assault led to violence harming EU citizens and interests. The proposal or action he's advocating is the condemnation of Israel's actions. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other info on him in other sections.

Looking at the summary, there's a mention of \"Austrian Council President Ursula Plassnik\" and \"Ursula Plassnik\" again.

'such aid can be effective only in a peaceful environment...'\"\n\nSo the issueSum would be about the Balkans and the Middle East.

First, I need to go through the debate summary carefully.\n\nLooking at the Western Balkans section, there's a mention of Hannes Swoboda warning against robbing Balkan countries of their accession prospects. The user's example response structure requires issueSum, positionSum, argSum, propSum. \n\nSo, the issue here is the EU's enlargement policy towards the Western Balkans. Swoboda's position is against deferring the Balkans' accession. The argument is that delaying could harm their prospects. His proposal might be about ensuring clear pathways for accession. \n\nWait, the summary says he warned against \"robbing Balkan countries of their prospects of accession or seeing them deferred to the distant future.\" So his position is against deferring. The argument is that maintaining prospects is important. The proposal might be about not deferring, but the summary doesn't mention specific proposals from him. \n\nIn the Middle East section, there's no mention of Swoboda. The Iran section mentions him once, but the user's example doesn't include that. Wait, the user's query is about Hannes Swoboda (PSE). Let me check the debate summary again.\n\nIn the Western Balkans Integration Policy section, under the absorption capacity debate, it says: \"Hannes Swoboda warned against 'robbing Balkan countries of their prospects of accession or seeing them deferred to the distant future' [Swoboda, March 2006].\" So that's his position. The issue is EU enlargement and absorption capacity. His argument is that deferring prospects is bad. The proposal isn't explicitly stated, but maybe his position is to maintain clear pathways. \n\nThe user's example has propSum as a proposal. But in the debate summary, Swoboda's contribution is a warning, not a specific proposal. So maybe propSum is empty. But the user's example includes a propSum. Wait, the user's instruction says if there are no points, respond with empty string. \n\nSo for Swoboda, the issue is EU enlargement and absorption capacity. Position is against deferring accession prospects. Argument is that it's important to maintain their prospects. Proposals? The summary doesn't mention specific proposals from him, just his warning. So propSum would be empty. \n\nBut I need to check if there's anything else. In the Iran section, he's mentioned as calling for consistent nuclear policies and greater IAEA involvement. Wait, the debate summary under Iran says: \"Hannes Swoboda called for consistent nuclear policies and greater IAEA involvement in multilateral uranium enrichment.\" So that's another point. \n\nSo the issues would be both Western Balkans and Iran. But the user's example has one issueSum. So need to combine. The main issues are EU enlargement policy (Western Balkans) and Iran's nuclear program. \n\nSo issueSum: The speaker addressed EU enlargement policy for the Western Balkans and Iran's nuclear program. \n\nPositionSum: He opposed deferring Balkan accession prospects and advocated for consistent nuclear policies. \n\nArgSum: His argument against deferring Balkans was to maintain their prospects, and for Iran, to ensure multilateral approaches. \n\nPropSum: He proposed consistent nuclear policies and IAEA involvement. \n\nWait, but the user's example has separate sections. Need to structure accordingly. Let me make sure I'm not including other speakers. The user said to only include points from the specified speaker. \n\nSo the final JSON should have:\n\nissueSum: \"EU enlargement policy for the Western Balkans and Iran's nuclear program\"\n\npositionSum: \"Opposed deferring Balkan accession prospects and advocated for consistent nuclear policies\"\n\nargSum: \"Argued that deferring Balkan prospects would harm their future and that Iran's nuclear issues require multilateral IAEA involvement\"\n\npropSum: \"Proposed consistent nuclear policies and increased IAEA involvement in uranium enrichment\"\n\nBut need to check the original debate summary again. For Swoboda, in the Western Balkans part, he warned against deferring. In the Iran part, he called for consistent nuclear policies and greater IAEA involvement. So that's two separate points. \n\nSo the JSON should include both issues, positions, arguments, and proposals. But the example response has a single summary each. So I need to condense into the four fields. \n\nSo:\n\nissueSum: \"EU enlargement policy for the Western Balkans and Iran's nuclear program\"\n\npositionSum: \"Opposed deferring Balkan accession prospects and advocated for consistent nuclear policies\"\n\nargSum: \"Argued that deferring Balkan prospects would harm their future and that Iran's nuclear issues require multilateral IAEA involvement\"\n\npropSum: \"Proposed consistent nuclear policies and increased IAEA involvement in uranium enrichment\"\n\nBut the user's example has propSum as a specific proposal. So this should be correct. However, the user's example also includes \"strict limitations on government demands for private data\" as a proposal.

(DE) Mr President, I crave your forgiveness for our late arrival. We have just had two traffic accidents to contend with, one on the road to the airport in Vienna and one on the road from Entzheim.\nThank you for the opportunity to inform you about our informal, Gymnich-format, meeting of foreign ministers, which took place this weekend in Salzburg. This was primarily concerned with two subject areas, the first of which was the challenges to foreign policy currently facing us, notably the developments in the Middle East and the imminent elections in Belarus and Ukraine. The second day was devoted to the Balkans, the Thessaloniki agenda, its implementation and its future.\nIf you will permit me, I would like to discuss the Middle East first and then move on to the Balkans.\nTo the Middle East, then: this region is, following the elections to the Palestinian Legislative Council and in the run-up to the elections in Israel, in a transitional stage, one in which we have a very clear and consistent message to send to the future Palestinian Government, for we need to make clear what are our own fundamental principles, on the basis of which we are prepared for further cooperation. The fundamentals are perfectly clear and consist of three elements. We are calling upon them to abandon violence, to agree to negotiations \u2013 which means recognising the existing agreements \u2013 and to acknowledge Israel\u2019s right to existence.\nIt is on this clear and consistent basis that our policy is developed, and on which we have launched an appeal to our partners in the Middle East. Hamas, in particular, will have to become aware of the fork in the road and come to a decision as to which path it wants to take in future. It must make clear which route it is going to take; we have spelled out what the conditions are, and in no respect has there been any change in them. We shall continue to support the Palestinian people, and also took the opportunity at \u2018Gymnich\u2019 to discuss what shape financial support might take in future. What is clear is that any such support must benefit the Palestinian people rather than being used for terrorism or for violence.\nWe are, then, with a great deal of attention, following developments, the efforts being made to put together a new Palestinian Government, and its future programme. Yesterday, President Mahmud Abbas and his delegation visited Vienna, where we had the chance to raise these issues with him. He and the interim government have our support in this difficult period, and I shall be happy to discuss events in closer detail if I get the opportunity to do so later on.\nTurning to the Balkans, this issue was and is an important one for the Austrian Presidency, and I therefore regard the Gymnich meeting and its engagement with it as a message of encouragement, even in a dual sense of the term, addressed to the people of the states of the Western Balkans. The road they have to travel towards Europe and towards meeting European standards may well be a difficult one, but the journey is worth it, and on that road they have our good wishes and support.\nIt is also a sign to our own peoples, encouraging them in the belief that it is indeed possible to find solutions to difficult problems \u2013 even to the most difficult ones. I therefore see it as a sign of hope and confidence that we succeeded, in the Salzburg Declaration, in underlining and making visible the prospects that the Balkan states have of acceding to the European Union.\nFor it was important, particularly at a time when people are talking in terms of 'enlargement fatigue', that this signal should be sent out in order to give our partners a good idea of what to expect in view of the extremely difficult decisions that we will have to take in 2006. It was evident from the guest list for our Salzburg meeting just how much the path we shall take this year will demand of us, for our guests included Martti Ahtisaari, the UN special envoy to Kosovo, and his deputy Albert Rohan, and we were able to discuss with them the future of that region. We had also invited Christian Schwarz-Schilling, the High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina; S\u00f8ren Jensen-Petersen, the head of UNMIK was present with his delegation, as was Ibrahim Rugova\u2019s successor as President of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu. I was also pleased that this segment of our Salzburg meeting managed to achieve something of a \u2018first\u2019 in the presence of Mr Brok, the chairman of your Foreign Affairs Committee, who took part in our discussions.\nThe Balkans are at the heart of Europe, and without them, European unification will be incomplete. We know that the road ahead of us will be a difficult one, but we are determined to go down it. We have decided to take a step-by-step approach to the work in hand, working through the issues one by one and resolving each of them in turn.\nIt is working on the European standards that is actually the core issue for each and every one of these countries. Yesterday, the Bosnian Prime Minister visited me in Vienna, and told me that what was crucial was not a date or a particular point in time in the course of development, but working together on European standards. Javier Solana, who has been keeping an eye on developments for a long time, describes what has been achieved since Thessaloniki in 2003 as a success story capable of being read on the agenda, and, more specifically on the order of business for the Salzburg meeting, since the issues with which this meeting concerned itself were issues of easier and improved trading arrangement, the fight against organised crime, young people and the facilitation of easier travel. We gave attention to the visa issue in view of the need to address the expectations that the people of these countries have of us. We also, though, have to make clear to them what options are open to us, and join with them in seeking, step by step, solutions to the problems that remain outstanding in this area and elsewhere.\nThere is no doubt about it: Europe is making a difference in this region, but we have also emphasised the responsibility that the countries concerned have for themselves, for in some of them, which have already been stabilised, we need to move on to their dynamic Europeanisation. As we proceed down that road, it must be made clear to them that they need the willingness to take the necessary action and demonstrate that quality that is described so well by the English term \u2018ownership\u2019.\nWe have stressed the need for regional cooperation, especially in view of the work being done on a regional free trade area, with a single free trade agreement, based on CEFTA, intended to replace 31 individual agreements. Speaking personally, I am very grateful to Commissioner Rehn and to the Commission as a whole for their commitment to this. The Council and the Commission are working on this hand in hand and side by side in the best sense of the word. I wish to thank the Commission for its communication at the end of January, and also for their willingness to join us in continuing to work towards the achievement of the goals set out in the Salzburg statement.\nContinued work is also called for on the part of the ministers of the national government within their own remits, for it is they who, along with other things, will have to network with their partners in the Balkan states in addressing actual problems. The ministers of the interior, in particular, are highly committed to this and bear a great responsibility, for it is they and their cooperation that determine what practical headway can be made on important issues.\nWe also discussed the topic of the EU\u2019s assimilation capacity and explored its implications. As you know, this is a topic that I brought into greater prominence last autumn, and I believe I was right to do so, for we are not seeking to put up an additional obstacle, but, essentially, to make us more aware of something that ought to be quite obvious, that being that it is not only the candidates for accession of whom homework is to be demanded, but the European Union itself also needs to do its own.\nAt this joint meeting, at a moment at which all of us were united around one table in Salzburg, we all had an experience that was not only disquieting but also, at the same time, gave us a sense of hopeful confidence: our deliberations were interrupted by news of the death of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107, and there was a European symbolism in our being able, at such a moment, to work on our common European future.\n(Applause)", "lang": "EN", "original": "Ursula Plassnik, President-in-Office of the Council .

The user provided a parliamentary debate summary and wants the main points from Ursula Plassnik's speech. First, I need to look through the debate summary and find all mentions of her.\n\nLooking at the Western Balkans section, there's a part where Plassnik defends the Salzburg statement. She rejects the idea that it's a superficial compromise and emphasizes the importance of the Balkans to Europe. Then, in the Middle East policy section, she mentions that humanitarian aid should continue but needs a peaceful environment. \n\nI need to make sure I only include her points. The user said not to include others. So, issueSum should cover her defense of the Salzburg statement and her stance on humanitarian aid. PositionSum would be her defense and the need for a peaceful environment. The arguments are her reasons for defending the statement and the necessity of peace for aid. Proposals might include her emphasis on the Balkans' importance and maintaining aid with conditions. Wait, but the example response has propSum as specific actions. Did she propose anything? She mentioned humanitarian aid continuing but didn't propose new policies. Maybe the proposals are her statements about the Balkans being central and the conditions for aid. Need to check the original text again.\n\nIn the summary, Plassnik's quotes are: \"The Balkans are at the heart of Europe...\" and \"humanitarian aid can be effective only in a peaceful environment.\" So her proposals are more about maintaining aid with conditions and emphasizing the Balkans' importance. So propSum could be about maintaining humanitarian aid with conditions and highlighting the Balkans' significance. But the example has propSum as specific actions. Maybe the answer is that she didn't make specific proposals beyond defending the statement and mentioning aid conditions. So propSum might be empty? Wait, the user said if no points, return empty. But the example has propSum as a summary of proposals. So I need to see if she made any proposals. The debate summary says she defended the Salzburg statement and talked about humanitarian aid. So perhaps her proposals are the continuation of aid under certain conditions and the importance of the Balkans. So the propSum would be \"emphasizing the importance of the Balkans to Europe and advocating for continued humanitarian aid under peaceful conditions.\" But need to check if that's accurate. The user wants only what's attributed to her. So the answer should capture her positions, arguments, and any proposals she mentioned. The example response includes propSum as specific actions. So I'll structure it accordingly.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The speaker addressed the importance of the Western Balkans to Europe and the conditions for humanitarian aid in the Middle East.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"Ursula Plassnik defended the Salzburg statement as a meaningful outcome and emphasized the necessity of a peaceful environment for effective humanitarian aid.\",\n\"argSum\": \"She argued that the Salzburg statement was not a superficial compromise and stressed that humanitarian aid requires a peaceful environment to be effective.\",\n\"propSum\": \"She highlighted the strategic importance of the Western Balkans to Europe and advocated for humanitarian aid to be contingent on peace and stability.\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Hannes Swoboda,", "english": "Hannes Swoboda, on behalf of the PSE Group . \u2013 (DE) Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I would just like to make two brief observations on the subject of the Middle East. Firstly, we are right to demand that Hamas should face up to reality and renounce violence, but that must not be licence for Israel to continue with its policy of unilateral violence, which is what we have just seen it engaging in. Secondly, Europe, and the USA, must be consistent in their nuclear policies, particularly in view of the different ways in which India and Iran are being treated, and the International Atomic Energy Authority in Vienna must be given a larger role in a multilateral system of uranium enrichment and nuclear waste management. If we stick with these principles, we will make progress.\nTurning to the Balkans, it strikes me that our actions are being guided by the principle that progress is to be defined as whatever is not regress. I have to say that my group and I are very embarrassed by the conduct of certain Member States, which are making themselves culpable for the way in which the business of making Europe fit for the accession of new Member States is being played off against the Balkan countries\u2019 prospects of accession. Europe will not, however, be made any stronger by the Balkan countries being robbed of their prospects of accession or seeing them deferred to the distant future. The guiding principle must still be the vision of EU membership, for which this House \u2013 my group included \u2013 has so often voted unanimously. Perfectly understandable though it is that demand should be made for the EU to be made more capable of welcoming new members \u2013 I am thinking here of the constitution and of the financial basis \u2013 this cannot be used against the countries of South-Eastern Europe and as a means of fending off their efforts at accession. Preparations for this on our side and in the Balkans must run in parallel. The preparation of both sides must be consistent and thorough, and while it is in progress, practical action needs to be taken to prepare the countries of the Balkans for accession to the European Union, not least by making visa arrangements simpler and easier. Further to what you had to say about the ministers of the interior \u2013 Mrs Gottes and Mr Ohr \u2013 I hope that they will do something tangible in order to give this region\u2019s young people, in particular, a chance to get to know Europe at last. Despite Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107\u2019s death \u2013 which was in many respects premature \u2013 it remains in the interests of the victims and of Europe\u2019s shared future that all those who committed crimes should be brought to The Hague for trial, and on that we must certainly insist.\nThe countries of the Balkans, which have so often in the course of our continent\u2019s history been the playthings of the European Great Powers, must progressively be integrated into the European Union. We will not, in any case, accept their being relegated to an earlier stage of their relationship with it. When, tomorrow, we vote to adopt the Brok report, we must do so stating clearly only that which is in the text, and without the interpretations that have, regrettably, been placed upon it in the last few hours and have the effect of falsifying what it actually contains. We defend the Balkan countries\u2019 prospects of membership of the European Union.\n(Applause)", "lang": "DE", "original": "Hannes Swoboda, im Namen der PSE-Fraktion . \u2013 Herr Pr\u00e4sident, Frau Ratspr\u00e4sidentin, Herr Kommissar! Ich m\u00f6chte nur zwei kurze Bemerkungen betreffend den Nahen Osten machen. Erstens fordern wir mit Recht, dass die Hamas die Realit\u00e4ten anerkennen und der Gewalt abschw\u00f6ren muss. Aber das darf kein Freibrief f\u00fcr Israel sein, seine einseitige Gewaltpolitik fortzusetzen, wie wir dies soeben erlebt haben. Zweitens: Die Nuklearpolitik Europas und der USA muss auf eine koh\u00e4rente Basis gebracht werden, vor allem angesichts unterschiedlicher Behandlung Indiens und Irans. Zweitens muss der Internationalen Atomenergiebeh\u00f6rde in Wien eine gr\u00f6\u00dfere Rolle in einem multilateralen System der Urananreicherung und der Entsorgung des Atomm\u00fclls gegeben werden. Wenn wir uns an diese Grunds\u00e4tze halten, werden sich Fortschritte einstellen.\nWas den Balkan betrifft, handeln wir, wie mir scheint, nach dem Motto \u201eWas kein R\u00fcckschritt ist, ist schon ein Fortschritt\u201c. Es ist die Schuld einiger Mitgliedstaaten \u2013 ich und auch meine Fraktion sind sehr betroffen davon\u00a0\u2013, dass man die Frage der Ert\u00fcchtigung Europas zur Aufnahme gegen eine Beitrittsperspektive f\u00fcr die L\u00e4nder des Balkans ausspielt. Aber Europa wird nicht stark, indem wir den L\u00e4ndern des Balkans die Beitrittsperspektive rauben oder in weite Ferne r\u00fccken. Die Vision der EU-Mitgliedschaft, die dieses Parlament so oft und auch meine Fraktion einstimmig beschlossen hat, muss die Richtschnur bleiben. Die selbstverst\u00e4ndliche Forderung nach Erh\u00f6hung der Aufnahmef\u00e4higkeit der EU \u2013 ich denke an die Verfassung, an die finanzielle Basis \u2013 kann und darf nicht gegen die Beitrittsbestrebungen der L\u00e4nder S\u00fcdosteuropas gewandt und ausgespielt werden. Wir m\u00fcssen die Vorbereitungen auf unserer Seite und die Vorbereitungen auf dem Balkan parallel f\u00fchren. W\u00e4hrend diese konsequente Vorbereitung beider Seiten auf die Erweiterung geschieht, m\u00fcssen konkrete Schritte gesetzt werden, um die L\u00e4nder des Balkans an die Europ\u00e4ische Union heranzuf\u00fchren, nicht zuletzt auch durch deutliche Erleichterungen im Visa-Regime. Ihre Worte \u00fcber die Innenminister in Gottes oder auch der Innenminister Ohr \u2013 ich hoffe, dass sie etwas Konkretes tun, um vor allem den jungen Menschen in dieser Region eine Chance zu geben, endlich auch Europa kennen zu lernen. Trotz des in mehrfacher Hinsicht vorzeitigen Todes von Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 bleibt im Interesse der Opfer und der gemeinsamen Zukunft Europas die Aufgabe, alle T\u00e4ter nach Den Haag zu bringen.

The summary says he warned against \"robbing Balkan countries of their prospects of accession or seeing them deferred to the distant future.\" So his position is about maintaining accession prospects. \n\nThen, in the \"Iran Nuclear Issue\" section, Swoboda is noted for calling for consistent nuclear policies and greater IAEA involvement in multilateral uranium enrichment. That's another point. \n\nI need to make sure I don't include other speakers' points. For example, Elmar Brok and Bernd Posselt are mentioned in the Iran section, but the user only wants Swoboda's contributions. \n\nSo, the issues Swoboda raised are Western Balkans integration and Iran's nuclear policy. His positions are supporting EU membership prospects for the Balkans and advocating for consistent nuclear policies. The arguments would be his warning against delaying accession and the need for IAEA involvement. The proposals are the consistent nuclear policies and IAEA's role. \n\nI should structure this into the JSON format as specified. Check if there are any other mentions of Swoboda.

Whilst the negotiations will see us tackling hard political facts, we must also ensure that there is a real dialogue of cultures, so that the fundamentalists will be unable to prevent the moderates \u2013 who are present in all the regions \u2013 from forming a majority.\nPerhaps, Madam President-in-Office, I might be permitted to address another aspect of great significance in some areas, that being the issue of the European Union\u2019s mission to the Congo. I would be very interested to know whether there is already a mandate in place for this, setting out what it is to do and for how long and over what geographical area it is to do it, and whether the Congolese authorities have officially invited such a project and the European Union\u2019s participation in it.

His position is that this alliance is dangerous. The argument is that it threatens peace, terrorism, and energy security. There's no mention of specific proposals, just the warning. \n\nI need to structure this into the JSON format as per the example. The issueSum should mention the alliance and the threats. PositionSum would state his warning about the danger. The argument is based on the threats to peace, terrorism, and energy security.

Be assured that the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is with you on this.\nThe various initiatives for getting the countries to cooperate with each other and with ourselves are excellent. It is also good that, in the end, the decision has been taken to use CEFTA, which already exists and is already up and running, as a basis for doing this instead of creating something new, as there was talk of doing previously. I think that this was an extremely wise decision. At the same time, we are also talking about different countries with different traditions, different histories and different degrees of development. It is therefore important that we keep sending out the message that all these countries are welcome to apply for membership of the European Community if they wish to do so and that, in that case, they will be treated on their own merits. There is at present a concern in certain quarters that we wish to lump the countries together again and that they will be treated as a unit. I believe that that anxiety is exaggerated, but it is very important to be extremely clear on the point that has been made, namely that each country is to be treated on its own merits.\nWith regard to the death of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107, we are talking here about an odious dictator, responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people and a large part of the tragedy that has taken place. I also regret that the trial could not be brought to a conclusion, and it was, I believe, an obviously quite pathetic man who ended his days.

What are the real questions? Firstly, does the European Union have the capacity to absorb these countries?

Are our Member States and their people ready to receive other Member States into the Union and, if so, when and how?\nFurthermore, another member of the Union, France, has amended its constitution, making it obligatory to hold a referendum on any further enlargement, following the accession of Romania, Bulgaria and Croatia.
