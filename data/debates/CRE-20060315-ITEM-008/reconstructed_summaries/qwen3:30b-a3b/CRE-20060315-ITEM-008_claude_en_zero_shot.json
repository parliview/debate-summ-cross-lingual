The main topics were Western Balkans integration and Middle East developments. The speaker in question is Olli Rehn, who is mentioned in the Commission Position section.\n\nLooking at the summary, under the \"Commission Position\" part, Olli Rehn is quoted as emphasizing the EU's transformative role in the Western Balkans. He mentioned specific proposals: a regional free trade agreement to replace 31 bilateral agreements, increased scholarships for researchers and students, and visa facilitation measures. Also, regarding Serbia's future after Milo\u0161evi\u0107's death, he expressed hope that Serbia would choose a European future over the nationalist past.\n\nI need to make sure that I only include the points attributed to Olli Rehn. The summary also mentions other speakers like Ursula Plassnik, Annemie Neyts-Uyttebroeck, Angelika Beer, Hannes Swoboda, and others, but the user wants only the arguments from Olli Rehn.\n\nSo the key points from Rehn are:\n1.

The summary has sections on Western Balkans Integration, Middle East Policy, Enlargement Capacity Concerns, and Key Actionable Outcomes. \n\nLooking at the \"Commission Position\" section, it says Olli Rehn emphasized the EU's transformative role in the Western Balkans. He mentioned specific proposals like a regional free trade agreement to replace 31 bilateral agreements, increased scholarships, and visa facilitation. Also, he talked about Serbia being at a crossroads and hoping they choose a European future over the nationalist past.\n\nWait, the user is asking for points attributed to Olli Rehn. The summary mentions him in the Commission Position. Let me check the exact quotes. The summary says: \"Olli Rehn emphasized the EU's transformative role in the region, stating 'in the western Balkans the EU can really make a difference' [Rehn, 2006-03-15]. He outlined concrete proposals including a regional free trade agreement to replace 31 bilateral agreements, increased scholarships for researchers and students, and visa facilitation measures. Regarding Serbia's future following Milo\u0161evi\u0107's death, Rehn emphasized that 'today Serbia is truly at the crossroads and I sincerely hope that the leaders and people of Serbia have the will and wisdom to choose the European future instead of the nationalist past' [Rehn, 2006-03-15].\"\n\nSo the main points here are:\n1. EU's transformative role in the Western Balkans.\n2. Proposals for a regional free trade agreement.\n3. Increased scholarships for researchers and students.\n4. Visa facilitation measures.\n5. Serbia's situation post-Milo\u0161evi\u0107, urging them to choose a European future.\n\nI need to make sure these are the only points attributed to him. The rest of the summary mentions other speakers like Plassnik, Neyts-Uyttebroeck, etc., but the user wants only Olli Rehn's arguments. The answer should list these points concisely without any other speakers' contributions. Also, check if there's anything else about Rehn in other sections. The Middle East Policy section doesn't mention him, and Enlargement Capacity Concerns mention Sudre and Plassnik. So the points are all from the Commission Position section. \n\nI should present them as the main arguments made by Olli Rehn.

(DE) Mr President, I crave your forgiveness for our late arrival. We have just had two traffic accidents to contend with, one on the road to the airport in Vienna and one on the road from Entzheim.\nThank you for the opportunity to inform you about our informal, Gymnich-format, meeting of foreign ministers, which took place this weekend in Salzburg. This was primarily concerned with two subject areas, the first of which was the challenges to foreign policy currently facing us, notably the developments in the Middle East and the imminent elections in Belarus and Ukraine. The second day was devoted to the Balkans, the Thessaloniki agenda, its implementation and its future.\nIf you will permit me, I would like to discuss the Middle East first and then move on to the Balkans.\nTo the Middle East, then: this region is, following the elections to the Palestinian Legislative Council and in the run-up to the elections in Israel, in a transitional stage, one in which we have a very clear and consistent message to send to the future Palestinian Government, for we need to make clear what are our own fundamental principles, on the basis of which we are prepared for further cooperation. The fundamentals are perfectly clear and consist of three elements. We are calling upon them to abandon violence, to agree to negotiations \u2013 which means recognising the existing agreements \u2013 and to acknowledge Israel\u2019s right to existence.\nIt is on this clear and consistent basis that our policy is developed, and on which we have launched an appeal to our partners in the Middle East. Hamas, in particular, will have to become aware of the fork in the road and come to a decision as to which path it wants to take in future. It must make clear which route it is going to take; we have spelled out what the conditions are, and in no respect has there been any change in them. We shall continue to support the Palestinian people, and also took the opportunity at \u2018Gymnich\u2019 to discuss what shape financial support might take in future. What is clear is that any such support must benefit the Palestinian people rather than being used for terrorism or for violence.\nWe are, then, with a great deal of attention, following developments, the efforts being made to put together a new Palestinian Government, and its future programme. Yesterday, President Mahmud Abbas and his delegation visited Vienna, where we had the chance to raise these issues with him. He and the interim government have our support in this difficult period, and I shall be happy to discuss events in closer detail if I get the opportunity to do so later on.\nTurning to the Balkans, this issue was and is an important one for the Austrian Presidency, and I therefore regard the Gymnich meeting and its engagement with it as a message of encouragement, even in a dual sense of the term, addressed to the people of the states of the Western Balkans. The road they have to travel towards Europe and towards meeting European standards may well be a difficult one, but the journey is worth it, and on that road they have our good wishes and support.\nIt is also a sign to our own peoples, encouraging them in the belief that it is indeed possible to find solutions to difficult problems \u2013 even to the most difficult ones. I therefore see it as a sign of hope and confidence that we succeeded, in the Salzburg Declaration, in underlining and making visible the prospects that the Balkan states have of acceding to the European Union.\nFor it was important, particularly at a time when people are talking in terms of 'enlargement fatigue', that this signal should be sent out in order to give our partners a good idea of what to expect in view of the extremely difficult decisions that we will have to take in 2006. It was evident from the guest list for our Salzburg meeting just how much the path we shall take this year will demand of us, for our guests included Martti Ahtisaari, the UN special envoy to Kosovo, and his deputy Albert Rohan, and we were able to discuss with them the future of that region. We had also invited Christian Schwarz-Schilling, the High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina; S\u00f8ren Jensen-Petersen, the head of UNMIK was present with his delegation, as was Ibrahim Rugova\u2019s successor as President of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu. I was also pleased that this segment of our Salzburg meeting managed to achieve something of a \u2018first\u2019 in the presence of Mr Brok, the chairman of your Foreign Affairs Committee, who took part in our discussions.\nThe Balkans are at the heart of Europe, and without them, European unification will be incomplete. We know that the road ahead of us will be a difficult one, but we are determined to go down it. We have decided to take a step-by-step approach to the work in hand, working through the issues one by one and resolving each of them in turn.\nIt is working on the European standards that is actually the core issue for each and every one of these countries. Yesterday, the Bosnian Prime Minister visited me in Vienna, and told me that what was crucial was not a date or a particular point in time in the course of development, but working together on European standards. Javier Solana, who has been keeping an eye on developments for a long time, describes what has been achieved since Thessaloniki in 2003 as a success story capable of being read on the agenda, and, more specifically on the order of business for the Salzburg meeting, since the issues with which this meeting concerned itself were issues of easier and improved trading arrangement, the fight against organised crime, young people and the facilitation of easier travel. We gave attention to the visa issue in view of the need to address the expectations that the people of these countries have of us. We also, though, have to make clear to them what options are open to us, and join with them in seeking, step by step, solutions to the problems that remain outstanding in this area and elsewhere.\nThere is no doubt about it: Europe is making a difference in this region, but we have also emphasised the responsibility that the countries concerned have for themselves, for in some of them, which have already been stabilised, we need to move on to their dynamic Europeanisation. As we proceed down that road, it must be made clear to them that they need the willingness to take the necessary action and demonstrate that quality that is described so well by the English term \u2018ownership\u2019.\nWe have stressed the need for regional cooperation, especially in view of the work being done on a regional free trade area, with a single free trade agreement, based on CEFTA, intended to replace 31 individual agreements. Speaking personally, I am very grateful to Commissioner Rehn and to the Commission as a whole for their commitment to this. The Council and the Commission are working on this hand in hand and side by side in the best sense of the word. I wish to thank the Commission for its communication at the end of January, and also for their willingness to join us in continuing to work towards the achievement of the goals set out in the Salzburg statement.\nContinued work is also called for on the part of the ministers of the national government within their own remits, for it is they who, along with other things, will have to network with their partners in the Balkan states in addressing actual problems. The ministers of the interior, in particular, are highly committed to this and bear a great responsibility, for it is they and their cooperation that determine what practical headway can be made on important issues.\nWe also discussed the topic of the EU\u2019s assimilation capacity and explored its implications. As you know, this is a topic that I brought into greater prominence last autumn, and I believe I was right to do so, for we are not seeking to put up an additional obstacle, but, essentially, to make us more aware of something that ought to be quite obvious, that being that it is not only the candidates for accession of whom homework is to be demanded, but the European Union itself also needs to do its own.\nAt this joint meeting, at a moment at which all of us were united around one table in Salzburg, we all had an experience that was not only disquieting but also, at the same time, gave us a sense of hopeful confidence: our deliberations were interrupted by news of the death of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107, and there was a European symbolism in our being able, at such a moment, to work on our common European future.\n(Applause)", "lang": "EN", "original": "Ursula Plassnik, President-in-Office of the Council . (DE) Mr President, I crave your forgiveness for our late arrival. We have just had two traffic accidents to contend with, one on the road to the airport in Vienna and one on the road from Entzheim.\nThank you for the opportunity to inform you about our informal, Gymnich-format, meeting of foreign ministers, which took place this weekend in Salzburg. This was primarily concerned with two subject areas, the first of which was the challenges to foreign policy currently facing us, notably the developments in the Middle East and the imminent elections in Belarus and Ukraine. The second day was devoted to the Balkans, the Thessaloniki agenda, its implementation and its future.\nIf you will permit me, I would like to discuss the Middle East first and then move on to the Balkans.\nTo the Middle East, then: this region is, following the elections to the Palestinian Legislative Council and in the run-up to the elections in Israel, in a transitional stage, one in which we have a very clear and consistent message to send to the future Palestinian Government, for we need to make clear what are our own fundamental principles, on the basis of which we are prepared for further cooperation. The fundamentals are perfectly clear and consist of three elements. We are calling upon them to abandon violence, to agree to negotiations \u2013 which means recognising the existing agreements \u2013 and to acknowledge Israel\u2019s right to existence.\nIt is on this clear and consistent basis that our policy is developed, and on which we have launched an appeal to our partners in the Middle East. Hamas, in particular, will have to become aware of the fork in the road and come to a decision as to which path it wants to take in future. It must make clear which route it is going to take; we have spelled out what the conditions are, and in no respect has there been any change in them. We shall continue to support the Palestinian people, and also took the opportunity at \u2018Gymnich\u2019 to discuss what shape financial support might take in future. What is clear is that any such support must benefit the Palestinian people rather than being used for terrorism or for violence.\nWe are, then, with a great deal of attention, following developments, the efforts being made to put together a new Palestinian Government, and its future programme. Yesterday, President Mahmud Abbas and his delegation visited Vienna, where we had the chance to raise these issues with him. He and the interim government have our support in this difficult period, and I shall be happy to discuss events in closer detail if I get the opportunity to do so later on.\nTurning to the Balkans, this issue was and is an important one for the Austrian Presidency, and I therefore regard the Gymnich meeting and its engagement with it as a message of encouragement, even in a dual sense of the term, addressed to the people of the states of the Western Balkans. The road they have to travel towards Europe and towards meeting European standards may well be a difficult one, but the journey is worth it, and on that road they have our good wishes and support.\nIt is also a sign to our own peoples, encouraging them in the belief that it is indeed possible to find solutions to difficult problems \u2013 even to the most difficult ones. I therefore see it as a sign of hope and confidence that we succeeded, in the Salzburg Declaration, in underlining and making visible the prospects that the Balkan states have of acceding to the European Union.\nFor it was important, particularly at a time when people are talking in terms of 'enlargement fatigue', that this signal should be sent out in order to give our partners a good idea of what to expect in view of the extremely difficult decisions that we will have to take in 2006. It was evident from the guest list for our Salzburg meeting just how much the path we shall take this year will demand of us, for our guests included Martti Ahtisaari, the UN special envoy to Kosovo, and his deputy Albert Rohan, and we were able to discuss with them the future of that region. We had also invited Christian Schwarz-Schilling, the High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina; S\u00f8ren Jensen-Petersen, the head of UNMIK was present with his delegation, as was Ibrahim Rugova\u2019s successor as President of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu. I was also pleased that this segment of our Salzburg meeting managed to achieve something of a \u2018first\u2019 in the presence of Mr Brok, the chairman of your Foreign Affairs Committee, who took part in our discussions.\nThe Balkans are at the heart of Europe, and without them, European unification will be incomplete. We know that the road ahead of us will be a difficult one, but we are determined to go down it. We have decided to take a step-by-step approach to the work in hand, working through the issues one by one and resolving each of them in turn.\nIt is working on the European standards that is actually the core issue for each and every one of these countries. Yesterday, the Bosnian Prime Minister visited me in Vienna, and told me that what was crucial was not a date or a particular point in time in the course of development, but working together on European standards. Javier Solana, who has been keeping an eye on developments for a long time, describes what has been achieved since Thessaloniki in 2003 as a success story capable of being read on the agenda, and, more specifically on the order of business for the Salzburg meeting, since the issues with which this meeting concerned itself were issues of easier and improved trading arrangement, the fight against organised crime, young people and the facilitation of easier travel. We gave attention to the visa issue in view of the need to address the expectations that the people of these countries have of us. We also, though, have to make clear to them what options are open to us, and join with them in seeking, step by step, solutions to the problems that remain outstanding in this area and elsewhere.\nThere is no doubt about it: Europe is making a difference in this region, but we have also emphasised the responsibility that the countries concerned have for themselves, for in some of them, which have already been stabilised, we need to move on to their dynamic Europeanisation. As we proceed down that road, it must be made clear to them that they need the willingness to take the necessary action and demonstrate that quality that is described so well by the English term \u2018ownership\u2019.\nWe have stressed the need for regional cooperation, especially in view of the work being done on a regional free trade area, with a single free trade agreement, based on CEFTA, intended to replace 31 individual agreements. Speaking personally, I am very grateful to Commissioner Rehn and to the Commission as a whole for their commitment to this. The Council and the Commission are working on this hand in hand and side by side in the best sense of the word. I wish to thank the Commission for its communication at the end of January, and also for their willingness to join us in continuing to work towards the achievement of the goals set out in the Salzburg statement.\nContinued work is also called for on the part of the ministers of the national government within their own remits, for it is they who, along with other things, will have to network with their partners in the Balkan states in addressing actual problems.

Let me start by reading through the debate summary carefully.\n\nFirst, the debate was about the results of the informal Council of Foreign Ministers meeting in Salzburg in March 2006. The main topics were Western Balkans integration and Middle East developments. The user specified that I should only include arguments attributed to Ursula Plassnik, so I need to look for her contributions.\n\nLooking at the sections, there's a part titled \"Council Position\" where Ursula Plassnik is mentioned. She defended the Austrian Presidency's approach, stating that \"the Balkans are at the heart of Europe, and without them, European unification will be incomplete.\" She also rejected criticism of the Salzburg statement as superficial, emphasizing that paragraph 3 explicitly mentioned EU membership as the ultimate goal in line with the Thessaloniki Declaration.\n\nIn the Middle East Policy section, she outlined three non-negotiable conditions for Hamas: abandoning violence, agreeing to negotiations (recognizing existing agreements), and acknowledging Israel's right to existence. She also mentioned that Hamas needs to choose a path, implying a fork in the road.\n\nAdditionally, in the Enlargement Capacity Concerns section, Plassnik acknowledged the concern about the EU's absorption capacity, noting that \"it is not only the candidates for accession of whom homework is to be demanded, but the European Union itself also needs to do its own.\" This shows she recognized the need for the EU to assess its own capacity alongside candidate countries.\n\nI need to make sure I don't include other speakers' points. For example, Annemie Neyts-Uyttebroeck and Angelika Beer's criticisms are not hers. Similarly, Swoboda's defense of Balkan membership is separate. The same goes for the Middle East responses from Salafranca, Koch-Mehrin, and Posselt. The key is to isolate Plassnik's statements.\n\nSo, compiling her points: \n\n1. Emphasized the importance of the Balkans to European unification.\n2. Defended the Salzburg statement, stating EU membership is the goal per Thessaloniki.\n3. Outlined conditions for Hamas engagement (abandon violence, negotiations, recognize Israel).\n4. Acknowledged the need for the EU to assess its own capacity alongside candidates.\n\nI should present these as the main arguments made by Ursula Plassnik. Let me check again to ensure no other speaker's points are included. Yes, that seems correct. The response should list these four points concisely.\n</think>\n\nUrsula Plassnik's arguments focused on three key areas:  \n\n1. **Western Balkans Integration**: Defended the Austrian Presidency's approach, asserting that \"the Balkans are at the heart of Europe, and without them, European unification will be incomplete.\" She rejected criticism of the Salzburg statement, emphasizing that paragraph 3 explicitly affirmed EU membership as the ultimate goal under the Thessaloniki Declaration.  \n\n2. **Middle East Policy**: Outlined three non-negotiable conditions for Hamas engagement: \"abandon violence,\" \"agree to negotiations (recognising existing agreements),\" and \"acknowledge Israel's right to existence.\" She stressed that Hamas must choose a path forward, implying a \"fork in the road.\"  \n\n3. **Enlargement Capacity**: Acknowledged concerns about the EU's absorption capacity, stating that \"it is not only the candidates for accession... but the European Union itself also needs to do its own\" homework.

Firstly, we are right to demand that Hamas should face up to reality and renounce violence, but that must not be licence for Israel to continue with its policy of unilateral violence, which is what we have just seen it engaging in. Secondly, Europe, and the USA, must be consistent in their nuclear policies, particularly in view of the different ways in which India and Iran are being treated, and the International Atomic Energy Authority in Vienna must be given a larger role in a multilateral system of uranium enrichment and nuclear waste management. If we stick with these principles, we will make progress.\nTurning to the Balkans, it strikes me that our actions are being guided by the principle that progress is to be defined as whatever is not regress. I have to say that my group and I are very embarrassed by the conduct of certain Member States, which are making themselves culpable for the way in which the business of making Europe fit for the accession of new Member States is being played off against the Balkan countries\u2019 prospects of accession. Europe will not, however, be made any stronger by the Balkan countries being robbed of their prospects of accession or seeing them deferred to the distant future. The guiding principle must still be the vision of EU membership, for which this House \u2013 my group included \u2013 has so often voted unanimously. Perfectly understandable though it is that demand should be made for the EU to be made more capable of welcoming new members \u2013 I am thinking here of the constitution and of the financial basis \u2013 this cannot be used against the countries of South-Eastern Europe and as a means of fending off their efforts at accession. Preparations for this on our side and in the Balkans must run in parallel. The preparation of both sides must be consistent and thorough, and while it is in progress, practical action needs to be taken to prepare the countries of the Balkans for accession to the European Union, not least by making visa arrangements simpler and easier. Further to what you had to say about the ministers of the interior \u2013 Mrs Gottes and Mr Ohr \u2013 I hope that they will do something tangible in order to give this region\u2019s young people, in particular, a chance to get to know Europe at last. Despite Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107\u2019s death \u2013 which was in many respects premature \u2013 it remains in the interests of the victims and of Europe\u2019s shared future that all those who committed crimes should be brought to The Hague for trial, and on that we must certainly insist.\nThe countries of the Balkans, which have so often in the course of our continent\u2019s history been the playthings of the European Great Powers, must progressively be integrated into the European Union. We will not, in any case, accept their being relegated to an earlier stage of their relationship with it. When, tomorrow, we vote to adopt the Brok report, we must do so stating clearly only that which is in the text, and without the interpretations that have, regrettably, been placed upon it in the last few hours and have the effect of falsifying what it actually contains. We defend the Balkan countries\u2019 prospects of membership of the European Union.\n(Applause)", "lang": "DE", "original": "Hannes Swoboda, im Namen der PSE-Fraktion . \u2013 Herr Pr\u00e4sident, Frau Ratspr\u00e4sidentin, Herr Kommissar! Ich m\u00f6chte nur zwei kurze Bemerkungen betreffend den Nahen Osten machen. Erstens fordern wir mit Recht, dass die Hamas die Realit\u00e4ten anerkennen und der Gewalt abschw\u00f6ren muss. Aber das darf kein Freibrief f\u00fcr Israel sein, seine einseitige Gewaltpolitik fortzusetzen, wie wir dies soeben erlebt haben. Zweitens: Die Nuklearpolitik Europas und der USA muss auf eine koh\u00e4rente Basis gebracht werden, vor allem angesichts unterschiedlicher Behandlung Indiens und Irans. Zweitens muss der Internationalen Atomenergiebeh\u00f6rde in Wien eine gr\u00f6\u00dfere Rolle in einem multilateralen System der Urananreicherung und der Entsorgung des Atomm\u00fclls gegeben werden. Wenn wir uns an diese Grunds\u00e4tze halten, werden sich Fortschritte einstellen.\nWas den Balkan betrifft, handeln wir, wie mir scheint, nach dem Motto \u201eWas kein R\u00fcckschritt ist, ist schon ein Fortschritt\u201c. Es ist die Schuld einiger Mitgliedstaaten \u2013 ich und auch meine Fraktion sind sehr betroffen davon\u00a0\u2013, dass man die Frage der Ert\u00fcchtigung Europas zur Aufnahme gegen eine Beitrittsperspektive f\u00fcr die L\u00e4nder des Balkans ausspielt. Aber Europa wird nicht stark, indem wir den L\u00e4ndern des Balkans die Beitrittsperspektive rauben oder in weite Ferne r\u00fccken. Die Vision der EU-Mitgliedschaft, die dieses Parlament so oft und auch meine Fraktion einstimmig beschlossen hat, muss die Richtschnur bleiben. Die selbstverst\u00e4ndliche Forderung nach Erh\u00f6hung der Aufnahmef\u00e4higkeit der EU \u2013 ich denke an die Verfassung, an die finanzielle Basis \u2013 kann und darf nicht gegen die Beitrittsbestrebungen der L\u00e4nder S\u00fcdosteuropas gewandt und ausgespielt werden. Wir m\u00fcssen die Vorbereitungen auf unserer Seite und die Vorbereitungen auf dem Balkan parallel f\u00fchren.

Ihre Worte \u00fcber die Innenminister in Gottes oder auch der Innenminister Ohr \u2013 ich hoffe, dass sie etwas Konkretes tun, um vor allem den jungen Menschen in dieser Region eine Chance zu geben, endlich auch Europa kennen zu lernen. Trotz des in mehrfacher Hinsicht vorzeitigen Todes von Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 bleibt im Interesse der Opfer und der gemeinsamen Zukunft Europas die Aufgabe, alle T\u00e4ter nach Den Haag zu bringen.

Firstly, we are right to demand that Hamas should face up to reality and renounce violence, but that must not be licence for Israel to continue with its policy of unilateral violence, which is what we have just seen it engaging in. Secondly, Europe, and the USA, must be consistent in their nuclear policies, particularly in view of the different ways in which India and Iran are being treated, and the International Atomic Energy Authority in Vienna must be given a larger role in a multilateral system of uranium enrichment and nuclear waste management. If we stick with these principles, we will make progress.\nTurning to the Balkans, it strikes me that our actions are being guided by the principle that progress is to be defined as whatever is not regress. I have to say that my group and I are very embarrassed by the conduct of certain Member States, which are making themselves culpable for the way in which the business of making Europe fit for the accession of new Member States is being played off against the Balkan countries\u2019 prospects of accession. Europe will not, however, be made any stronger by the Balkan countries being robbed of their prospects of accession or seeing them deferred to the distant future. The guiding principle must still be the vision of EU membership, for which this House \u2013 my group included \u2013 has so often voted unanimously. Perfectly understandable though it is that demand should be made for the EU to be made more capable of welcoming new members \u2013 I am thinking here of the constitution and of the financial basis \u2013 this cannot be used against the countries of South-Eastern Europe and as a means of fending off their efforts at accession. Preparations for this on our side and in the Balkans must run in parallel. The preparation of both sides must be consistent and thorough, and while it is in progress, practical action needs to be taken to prepare the countries of the Balkans for accession to the European Union, not least by making visa arrangements simpler and easier. Further to what you had to say about the ministers of the interior \u2013 Mrs Gottes and Mr Ohr \u2013 I hope that they will do something tangible in order to give this region\u2019s young people, in particular, a chance to get to know Europe at last. Despite Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107\u2019s death \u2013 which was in many respects premature \u2013 it remains in the interests of the victims and of Europe\u2019s shared future that all those who committed crimes should be brought to The Hague for trial, and on that we must certainly insist.\nThe countries of the Balkans, which have so often in the course of our continent\u2019s history been the playthings of the European Great Powers, must progressively be integrated into the European Union. We will not, in any case, accept their being relegated to an earlier stage of their relationship with it. When, tomorrow, we vote to adopt the Brok report, we must do so stating clearly only that which is in the text, and without the interpretations that have, regrettably, been placed upon it in the last few hours and have the effect of falsifying what it actually contains. We defend the Balkan countries\u2019 prospects of membership of the European Union.\n(Applause)", "reconstructed_position": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the main points or arguments made by Hannes Swoboda in the parliamentary debate summary provided. Let me start by reading through the summary again to make sure I don't miss anything.\n\nThe debate was about the results of the informal Council of Foreign Ministers meeting in Salzburg in March 2006. The main topics were Western Balkans integration and Middle East developments. The user is asking specifically about Hannes Swoboda's contributions.\n\nLooking at the Executive Summary section, under the Western Balkans Integration part, there's a mention of Hannes Swoboda. The summary says: \"Hannes Swoboda strongly defended Balkan membership prospects, declaring 'Europe will not, however, be made any stronger by the Balkan countries being robbed of their prospects of accession or seeing them deferred to the distant future' [Swoboda, 2006-03-15].\"\n\nSo, the key point here is that Swoboda was defending the prospects of Balkan countries joining the EU. He argued that Europe's strength depends on allowing these countries to have access to EU membership, and that delaying or denying their accession would weaken Europe. \n\nI need to make sure there are no other mentions of Swoboda in the summary. Let me check the rest of the document. The Middle East Policy section mentions other speakers like Salafranca, Koch-Mehrin, and Posselt, but not Swoboda. The Enlargement Capacity Concerns section mentions Margie Sudre and Plassnik. The Key Actionable Outcomes don't mention Swoboda either. \n\nSo, the only direct contribution from Swoboda is the quote about Europe's strength and not robbing Balkan countries of their accession prospects. There's no other information about his arguments in the summary. Therefore, the main point is his defense of Balkan membership prospects and the importance of not deferring their accession.\n</think>\n\nHannes Swoboda argued that Europe's strength depends on allowing Balkan countries to pursue EU accession, stating that \"Europe will not, however, be made any stronger by the Balkan countries being robbed of their prospects of accession or seeing them deferred to the distant future.\" He emphasized the importance of maintaining credible enlargement prospects for the Western Balkans.", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Annemie Neyts-Uyttebroeck,", "english": "Annemie Neyts-Uyttebroeck, on behalf of the ALDE Group . \u2013 Mr President, I had hoped that a strong and positive message would have come out of the Balkan Conference.

On the one hand, there is the situation with which both sides in the Holy Land itself are presenting us; on the other, there is the issue of how probable it is that Iran will be deterred from a military nuclear programme. And if, as is indeed possible, there is a closing of the circle \u2013 with Iran, Syria, a multilateral agreement in Lebanon with Hisbollah and contacts with Hamas \u2013 there arises the great danger of an alliance that is highly problematic and to which we have to find a response, not only in order to secure peace and fight terrorism, but also to guarantee the security of our energy supplies.\nI am grateful, Madam President-in-Office, for having been able to be present for some of the discussions. Whilst the negotiations will see us tackling hard political facts, we must also ensure that there is a real dialogue of cultures, so that the fundamentalists will be unable to prevent the moderates \u2013 who are present in all the regions \u2013 from forming a majority.\nPerhaps, Madam President-in-Office, I might be permitted to address another aspect of great significance in some areas, that being the issue of the European Union\u2019s mission to the Congo. I would be very interested to know whether there is already a mandate in place for this, setting out what it is to do and for how long and over what geographical area it is to do it, and whether the Congolese authorities have officially invited such a project and the European Union\u2019s participation in it.

I would like to say something briefly about the Middle East.\nWe find ourselves in ever-greater difficulties, as a result not only of developments over the past few days, but of those that have taken place over recent weeks and months. On the one hand, there is the situation with which both sides in the Holy Land itself are presenting us; on the other, there is the issue of how probable it is that Iran will be deterred from a military nuclear programme. And if, as is indeed possible, there is a closing of the circle \u2013 with Iran, Syria, a multilateral agreement in Lebanon with Hisbollah and contacts with Hamas \u2013 there arises the great danger of an alliance that is highly problematic and to which we have to find a response, not only in order to secure peace and fight terrorism, but also to guarantee the security of our energy supplies.\nI am grateful, Madam President-in-Office, for having been able to be present for some of the discussions. Whilst the negotiations will see us tackling hard political facts, we must also ensure that there is a real dialogue of cultures, so that the fundamentalists will be unable to prevent the moderates \u2013 who are present in all the regions \u2013 from forming a majority.\nPerhaps, Madam President-in-Office, I might be permitted to address another aspect of great significance in some areas, that being the issue of the European Union\u2019s mission to the Congo. I would be very interested to know whether there is already a mandate in place for this, setting out what it is to do and for how long and over what geographical area it is to do it, and whether the Congolese authorities have officially invited such a project and the European Union\u2019s participation in it.

They have therefore gone further than the Thessaloniki declaration of 2003, which talked about the great challenge represented by the integration of the five countries of the Balkans and their eventual accession to the Union. The MEPs from the UMP agree with this vision and this prospect and are convinced that, without the Balkans, European unification is not complete. They also share the view that it will be a long journey with many obstacles along the way, but first of all they would ask that, in relation to the Balkans and any other possible future enlargement, the real questions be set out clearly. What are the real questions? Firstly, does the European Union have the capacity to absorb these countries? I would point out that this is one of the Copenhagen criteria, a criterion that is too often forgotten; financial capacity, institutional capacity, but also political capacity. Are our Member States and their people ready to receive other Member States into the Union and, if so, when and how?\nFurthermore, another member of the Union, France, has amended its constitution, making it obligatory to hold a referendum on any further enlargement, following the accession of Romania, Bulgaria and Croatia. Our partners may welcome this, or lament it, but that is now the institutional reality.\nFinally, for years, the MEPs from the UMP have been calling for an in-depth debate within the European Union on the subject of Europe\u2019s borders. It is high time that that debate took place! We must look reality in the face and make a mature choice on the future of the European Union, in terms of political content and geographical borders.

I do indeed believe that we must not budge on this; there must be no doubt whatever about the fact that the states of South-Eastern Europe are indeed European, and that they are entitled to become full members of the European Union as soon as all the criteria have been satisfied \u2013 which includes the enlargement criterion that applies to us.\nThirdly \u2013 and here I have to disagree with Mrs Koch-Mehrin \u2013 I would like to say that what we should be doing for Palestine is not just giving humanitarian aid, but also helping them to achieve pluralism \u2013 difficult though that must be conceded to be. Corrupt and dubious though the Fatah state was, a state ruled by Hamas would be even more objectionable. We must promote the peace process and pluralism by every means to hand in order to prevent an Iranian zone of influence extending from the Gulf to the Mediterranean coming into being.\nFourthly, Iran, which is second only to China as the oldest great power in the world, is not a monolithic block, and that is why we have to apply a combination of stringency and intense diplomatic effort to dealing with it. Here, too, no matter how unacceptable the country\u2019s current President may be, we must not lose faith in dialogue. There is more to Iran than its president; it is one of the oldest states in the world, and we Europeans must do everything in our power to reinforce the pluralistic forces within it and to prevent it from degenerating into aggressive uniformity.", "reconstructed_position": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to outline the main points or arguments made by Bernd Posselt during the parliamentary debate, based on the provided summary. \n\nFirst, I need to go through the debate summary carefully. The summary mentions several speakers and their contributions. The user specified Bernd Posselt (PPE-DE), so I need to focus only on his parts.\n\nLooking at the Middle East Policy section, there's a mention of Bernd Posselt. The summary states: \"Bernd Posselt advocated for broader engagement, stating 'what we should be doing for Palestine is not just giving humanitarian aid, but also helping them to achieve pluralism' [Posselt, 2006-03-15].\" \n\nSo his main argument here is that the EU should do more than just humanitarian aid; they should help Palestine achieve pluralism. That's one point. \n\nI need to check if there are any other mentions of Bernd Posselt in other sections. The summary has sections on Western Balkans Integration, Middle East Policy, Enlargement Capacity Concerns, etc. Scanning through each part:\n\n- In the Western Balkans section, speakers like Annemie Neyts-Uyttebroeck, Angelika Beer, Hannes Swoboda are mentioned, but not Posselt.\n- In the Middle East Policy section, Salafranca, Koch-Mehrin, and Posselt are mentioned. The others like Sudre and Plassnik are in the Enlargement Capacity section.\n- No other mentions of Posselt elsewhere.\n\nSo the only contribution from Bernd Posselt is the one about Palestine and pluralism. The user's instruction says to include only the points attributed to the speaker. Since there's only one point here, that's the only thing to include. \n\nI need to make sure not to include anything from other speakers. The user also mentioned that if there are no points, return an empty string. But here, there is one point. \n\nSo the answer should be a concise outline of his argument: advocating for broader engagement with Palestine beyond humanitarian aid, focusing on helping them achieve pluralism.\n</think>\n\nBernd Posselt (PPE-DE) advocated for broader engagement with Palestine, arguing that EU efforts should extend beyond humanitarian aid to actively support the development of pluralism in the region.", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Ursula Plassnik,", "english": "Ursula Plassnik, President-in-Office of the Council .

The summary says she defended the Austrian Presidency's approach, stating that \"the Balkans are at the heart of Europe, and without them, European unification will be incomplete.\" She also rejected criticism of the Salzburg statement as superficial, emphasizing that paragraph 3 explicitly mentioned EU membership as the ultimate goal in line with the Thessaloniki Declaration.\n\nAdditionally, in the Middle East Policy section, she outlined three non-negotiable conditions for Hamas: abandoning violence, agreeing to negotiations (recognizing existing agreements), and acknowledging Israel's right to existence. She also mentioned that Hamas needs to choose a path, implying a fork in the road.\n\nAnother part under \"Enlargement Capacity Concerns\" has her acknowledging the concern about the EU's capacity, noting that both candidates and the EU itself need to do their homework.\n\nSo, compiling these points, Ursula Plassnik's arguments include:\n1.
