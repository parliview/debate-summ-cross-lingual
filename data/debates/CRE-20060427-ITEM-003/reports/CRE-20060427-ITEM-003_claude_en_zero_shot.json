It is vitally important for European citizens to possess the necessary knowledge and skills that allow effective communication and facilitate mutual understanding. Simply learning a 'lingua franca' is insufficient and fails to reflect Europe's true identity.\nThe proposal sent to us by the Commission follows on from the decision by the European Council in Barcelona in March 2002, at which the Heads of State or Government called for improvements to the learning of basic skills with the teaching, from a very early age, of at least two languages. They also called for a common linguistic proficiency indicator, in other words, a language test to measure objectively the proficiency of citizens in foreign languages. Three years later, the Commission is proposing to create a European Indicator of Language Competence, common to all the Member States and with a high level of accuracy and reliability. The purpose of the indicator is to measure the proficiency of European citizens in foreign languages in four linguistic skills: reading, comprehension, speaking and writing. The indicator will record linguistic proficiency at each of the six levels on the scale of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages of the Council of Europe. This Common European Framework of Reference is widely accepted and is already used in many of the Member States.\nI agree with the Commission that, at an initial phase, linguistic proficiency should be tested in the five most widely taught languages in the European Union. The addition of Polish as the sixth language, at the initial phase, is something that will be determined by the budget, if of course it is feasible. A Eurobarometer poll published this week shows that English with 38%, French with 14%, German also with 14%, Spanish with 6% and Italian with 3% are the five most popular languages in the European Union which European citizens choose to learn.\nNonetheless, I stress in the report that it is important at the next stage to extend this test to a larger number of European Union languages. I should like to point out here that non-Community languages, minority languages and regional dialects do not concern the indicator in question. However, they may be included within the framework of the strategy on multilingualism on which the European Parliament is preparing a report and with which they are more in keeping from the point of view of content. That is why I do not agree with Amendments 1 and 2, given that they do not refer to this specific report, do not improve the cohesion of the test and do not agree with the objectives of the indicator of linguistic competence. The indicator of linguistic competence is no more than a technical instrument that will be financed through an existing programme, namely the lifelong learning programme, the main purpose of which is to substantially strengthen the mobility of citizens, workers or students in the European Union.\nIt is also worth noting that, according to recent statistics, while the percentage of primary school pupils being taught a foreign language is increasing, unfortunately the diversity of languages on offer is decreasing. In many countries foreign language learning tends to mean simply learning English. The indicator can also be used to extrapolate policy conclusions at European and national level.\nDespite the Commission's involvement in the process, the Member States must participate actively in the implementation and development of the indicator, because they alone can provide information on various factors that affect linguistic proficiency, such as television, family environment, number of hours of teaching, experience of teachers and so forth.\nBroadly speaking, the European Indicator of Language Competence is considered to be an extremely valuable instrument for obtaining reliable information on the linguistic proficiency of Europeans, in particular young people, enabling comparisons to be drawn between Member State policies on linguistic matters and facilitating the identification and exchanges of best practices, thereby giving fresh impetus to language teaching.\nMr President, Commissioner, proficiency in at least two foreign languages should form part of the basic set of skills of a typical European living, studying, working and generally circulating in the European Union. We must not forget that 2006 is the 'European Year of Workers' Mobility', in which case I feel that it offers us a very important opportunity to highlight the importance of the skills of European citizens and to offer young people an incentive to attach greater importance and attention to the learning of foreign languages.\nWe await the decisions of the Council on 18 May on the subject of the indicator of language competence with great interest. I am hoping for a positive response from the Council and an understanding of its obligation to take account of the parameters and an evaluation of the overall efforts of the European Parliament.\nI cannot close without mentioning the living example of multilingualism and its importance which we find in this House. I refer to the interpreters, thanks to whom the European Parliament is the only institution working in 20 languages, bringing our work closer to the citizens and making our communication more effective and for that I thank them.", "lang": "EL", "original": "\u039c\u03b1\u03bd\u03ce\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2 \u039c\u03b1\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03bc\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 (PPE-DE),

It is vitally important for European citizens to possess the necessary knowledge and skills that allow effective communication and facilitate mutual understanding. Simply learning a 'lingua franca' is insufficient and fails to reflect Europe's true identity.\nThe proposal sent to us by the Commission follows on from the decision by the European Council in Barcelona in March 2002, at which the Heads of State or Government called for improvements to the learning of basic skills with the teaching, from a very early age, of at least two languages. They also called for a common linguistic proficiency indicator, in other words, a language test to measure objectively the proficiency of citizens in foreign languages. Three years later, the Commission is proposing to create a European Indicator of Language Competence, common to all the Member States and with a high level of accuracy and reliability. The purpose of the indicator is to measure the proficiency of European citizens in foreign languages in four linguistic skills: reading, comprehension, speaking and writing. The indicator will record linguistic proficiency at each of the six levels on the scale of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages of the Council of Europe. This Common European Framework of Reference is widely accepted and is already used in many of the Member States.\nI agree with the Commission that, at an initial phase, linguistic proficiency should be tested in the five most widely taught languages in the European Union. The addition of Polish as the sixth language, at the initial phase, is something that will be determined by the budget, if of course it is feasible. A Eurobarometer poll published this week shows that English with 38%, French with 14%, German also with 14%, Spanish with 6% and Italian with 3% are the five most popular languages in the European Union which European citizens choose to learn.\nNonetheless, I stress in the report that it is important at the next stage to extend this test to a larger number of European Union languages. I should like to point out here that non-Community languages, minority languages and regional dialects do not concern the indicator in question. However, they may be included within the framework of the strategy on multilingualism on which the European Parliament is preparing a report and with which they are more in keeping from the point of view of content. That is why I do not agree with Amendments 1 and 2, given that they do not refer to this specific report, do not improve the cohesion of the test and do not agree with the objectives of the indicator of linguistic competence. The indicator of linguistic competence is no more than a technical instrument that will be financed through an existing programme, namely the lifelong learning programme, the main purpose of which is to substantially strengthen the mobility of citizens, workers or students in the European Union.\nIt is also worth noting that, according to recent statistics, while the percentage of primary school pupils being taught a foreign language is increasing, unfortunately the diversity of languages on offer is decreasing. In many countries foreign language learning tends to mean simply learning English. The indicator can also be used to extrapolate policy conclusions at European and national level.\nDespite the Commission's involvement in the process, the Member States must participate actively in the implementation and development of the indicator, because they alone can provide information on various factors that affect linguistic proficiency, such as television, family environment, number of hours of teaching, experience of teachers and so forth.\nBroadly speaking, the European Indicator of Language Competence is considered to be an extremely valuable instrument for obtaining reliable information on the linguistic proficiency of Europeans, in particular young people, enabling comparisons to be drawn between Member State policies on linguistic matters and facilitating the identification and exchanges of best practices, thereby giving fresh impetus to language teaching.\nMr President, Commissioner, proficiency in at least two foreign languages should form part of the basic set of skills of a typical European living, studying, working and generally circulating in the European Union. We must not forget that 2006 is the 'European Year of Workers' Mobility', in which case I feel that it offers us a very important opportunity to highlight the importance of the skills of European citizens and to offer young people an incentive to attach greater importance and attention to the learning of foreign languages.\nWe await the decisions of the Council on 18 May on the subject of the indicator of language competence with great interest. I am hoping for a positive response from the Council and an understanding of its obligation to take account of the parameters and an evaluation of the overall efforts of the European Parliament.\nI cannot close without mentioning the living example of multilingualism and its importance which we find in this House. I refer to the interpreters, thanks to whom the European Parliament is the only institution working in 20 languages, bringing our work closer to the citizens and making our communication more effective and for that I thank them."}, {"speaker": "J\u00e1n Fige\u013e,", "english": "J\u00e1n Fige\u013e, Member of the Commission .

The indicator will stimulate the exchange and knowledge of the good practices of the various Member States and will be a reliable system for measuring progress, initially in the five languages most widely taught within the Union: English, French, German, Spanish and Italian.\nThe choice of these five languages for the first stage should not prejudice the other European languages, but it should represent the beginning of a process, without ruling out the possibility of including other languages during subsequent stages, of course. Specifically, thanks to the introduction of certain amendments that we have worked on in conjunction with the rapporteur, his report leaves open the possibility of a future evaluation of a greater number of official European languages, without prejudicing the teaching of the other languages not evaluated by the indicator.\nBefore I finish, I would like to make it clear that, although this report is not the right place to deal with the situation of the minority languages or of other non-European languages, but that it is intended to improve the language competency of the citizens, the quality of teaching and learning systems for the official European languages, it should not in any way prejudice the recognition and protection of those languages that are not official in the Union, but which are official in certain Member States.\nI would like to end by saying that I am pleased with the text since it represents an important step forward towards a closer Union amongst the European citizens, as well as being very good news in terms of improving education within the Union.", "lang": "ES", "original": "Maria Badia i Cutchet, en nombre del Grupo del PSE . \u2013 (ES) Se\u00f1or Presidente, se\u00f1or Comisario, en primer lugar quiero felicitar al se\u00f1or Mavrommatis por su informe y tambi\u00e9n a la Comisi\u00f3n por dar cumplimiento a una decisi\u00f3n adoptada por el Consejo Europeo de Barcelona en 2002.\nEstoy convencida de que un elemento decisivo para el \u00e9xito del proceso de integraci\u00f3n europea y tambi\u00e9n para el fomento de una ciudadan\u00eda europea es el conocimiento por parte de los ciudadanos de distintas lenguas europeas, adem\u00e1s de su lengua materna, lo cual es positivo tambi\u00e9n para mejorar la movilidad en el interior de la Uni\u00f3n.\nTeniendo en cuenta que en la actualidad no se dispone de datos sobre las capacidades ling\u00fc\u00edsticas y de comunicaci\u00f3n reales de los ciudadanos de la Uni\u00f3n, pero conscientes de que existen situaciones muy diferenciadas entre Estados miembros, creo que el indicador europeo de competencia ling\u00fc\u00edstica puede ser un buen instrumento para incentivar la mejora y la convergencia de las pol\u00edticas de ense\u00f1anza de lenguas extranjeras por parte de los Estados miembros.\nEste sistema, adem\u00e1s de contribuir a la mejora de la comunicaci\u00f3n y al entendimiento mutuo entre ciudadanos y ciudadanas europeos, supondr\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n una mejora cualitativa de la ense\u00f1anza de lenguas extranjeras en los sistemas de educaci\u00f3n y de formaci\u00f3n europeos, contribuyendo asimismo a alcanzar los objetivos de Lisboa.

The indicator will stimulate the exchange and knowledge of the good practices of the various Member States and will be a reliable system for measuring progress, initially in the five languages most widely taught within the Union: English, French, German, Spanish and Italian.\nThe choice of these five languages for the first stage should not prejudice the other European languages, but it should represent the beginning of a process, without ruling out the possibility of including other languages during subsequent stages, of course. Specifically, thanks to the introduction of certain amendments that we have worked on in conjunction with the rapporteur, his report leaves open the possibility of a future evaluation of a greater number of official European languages, without prejudicing the teaching of the other languages not evaluated by the indicator.\nBefore I finish, I would like to make it clear that, although this report is not the right place to deal with the situation of the minority languages or of other non-European languages, but that it is intended to improve the language competency of the citizens, the quality of teaching and learning systems for the official European languages, it should not in any way prejudice the recognition and protection of those languages that are not official in the Union, but which are official in certain Member States.\nI would like to end by saying that I am pleased with the text since it represents an important step forward towards a closer Union amongst the European citizens, as well as being very good news in terms of improving education within the Union."}, {"speaker": "Erna Hennicot-Schoepges,", "english": "Erna Hennicot-Schoepges, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . \u2013 (FR) Mr\u00a0President, I should like to begin by congratulating our rapporteur on his excellent work.\nAs you know, my country, Luxembourg, is in favour of multilingualism, and perhaps on more than one account.

The Indicator thus obtained would run counter to the Barcelona Summit objectives, because the choice of languages establishes working guidelines for Member States interested in obtaining results. The objective that we share, that every child should learn to speak at least two languages apart from their mother tongue, can be assessed.\nPlease note, Mr Figel', the Indicator is obtained by sample and via written exams. There is no practical reason why people should not be able to learn any language in the EU area. If the tests are applied to the world of languages, the conclusions might be surprising. One might find, for example, that Turkish, Arabic, Chinese and Russian are important languages in the Union and that the children of immigrants are the closest to being able to speak two languages in addition to their mother tongue. This is why we voted in favour of the Resetarits amendments.\nI should briefly like to make a second comment. The Indicator should not be confused with the certificate of language knowledge. The harmonisation of language certificates is not a cultural measure and is not socially neutral. With populist policies and public opinion divided over immigration policy, such a measure could legitimise discriminatory policies of selecting immigrants, to the detriment of the poorest countries in the Union.", "lang": "PT", "original": "Miguel Portas, em nome do Grupo GUE/NGL . \u2013 A cria\u00e7\u00e3o de um indicador de compet\u00eancia lingu\u00edstica fi\u00e1vel e cred\u00edvel \u00e9 consensual entre n\u00f3s.

In addition to cultural importance, every language has special significance in terms of nation-building and also in social and economic terms. Language is therefore important in dealings with the administration and for legal purposes in their broadest sense.\nResearch suggests that almost half of the several thousand languages currently used by the nations of the world will disappear over the next 100\u00a0years. A significant amount of the knowledge amassed over the centuries will disappear with them. Accordingly, individual countries and nations are implementing a range of measures to protect their languages. Some, like Germany, have provisions in their constitutions to this effect. In others such as France, Poland and Slovakia, the national parliaments have passed laws to this end.\nMr\u00a0Mavrommatis\u2019 report deals exclusively with the motion for a European Parliament resolution on measures to promote multilingualism and language learning in the European Union, together with establishing language competence. It enshrines a strong preference towards two or five languages. Not one of them is a Slavonic language, even though one in four of the Union\u2019s citizens use a language of this type. By way of example, I could refer to Polish, a language used by more than 10% of the population of the Union.\nInstead of referring to multilingualism, therefore, we should refer to the culturally dominant nations restricting and displacing the culture of smaller ones. We should refer to the operation of European institutions and the competencies of their officials, including preparing them to carry out their duties in a multilingual Europe.\nThe administrative dimension of language is quite different from its economic or cultural dimensions. Research and checks have revealed widespread infringement of provisions protecting national languages, especially in the new Member States. This can be verified simply by visiting a supermarket and looking at the goods on the shelves.

In addition to cultural importance, every language has special significance in terms of nation-building and also in social and economic terms. Language is therefore important in dealings with the administration and for legal purposes in their broadest sense.\nResearch suggests that almost half of the several thousand languages currently used by the nations of the world will disappear over the next 100\u00a0years. A significant amount of the knowledge amassed over the centuries will disappear with them. Accordingly, individual countries and nations are implementing a range of measures to protect their languages. Some, like Germany, have provisions in their constitutions to this effect. In others such as France, Poland and Slovakia, the national parliaments have passed laws to this end.\nMr\u00a0Mavrommatis\u2019 report deals exclusively with the motion for a European Parliament resolution on measures to promote multilingualism and language learning in the European Union, together with establishing language competence. It enshrines a strong preference towards two or five languages. Not one of them is a Slavonic language, even though one in four of the Union\u2019s citizens use a language of this type. By way of example, I could refer to Polish, a language used by more than 10% of the population of the Union.\nInstead of referring to multilingualism, therefore, we should refer to the culturally dominant nations restricting and displacing the culture of smaller ones. We should refer to the operation of European institutions and the competencies of their officials, including preparing them to carry out their duties in a multilingual Europe.\nThe administrative dimension of language is quite different from its economic or cultural dimensions. Research and checks have revealed widespread infringement of provisions protecting national languages, especially in the new Member States. This can be verified simply by visiting a supermarket and looking at the goods on the shelves. It would be unusual to find that the information on consumption and use of these goods had been translated. Such systematic restriction of multilingualism benefits entrepreneurs at the expense of consumers. No thought is given to the fact that the European Union will only become strong and have a raison d\u2019\u00eatre if it becomes user-friendly and if it makes it possible for its citizens to demonstrate respect for each other and for their cultural differences, including linguistic ones."}, {"speaker": "Andreas M\u00f6lzer (NI).", "english": "Andreas M\u00f6lzer (NI). \u2013 (DE) Mr President, there is, of course, in our interconnected world, no alternative to the acquisition of new knowledge or to the mastering of more than one language.

The fact is that there is no democratic basis whatever for the favoured position accorded to English and French within the EU, and, particularly given the greater importance of German as a consequence of the enlargement, it is not acceptable that the EU should disregard long-standing agreements and more or less ignore German as a working language.\nIt is an unfortunate fact that this House is as yet the only institution that not only reaches its decision in full public view but also makes them accessible to the public in their own national languages.

Every merchant\u2019s apprentice was expected to be fluent in the four local languages. This meant that in addition to one\u2019s own language, one had to be able to speak the languages of the three main trading partners. The report rightly claims that language proficiency is an important precondition for citizens of the European Union to be able to enjoy the fundamental freedoms of the Union. Because services make up 70% of the volume of our economy, communication skills are of great importance in economic growth.\nIt is not likely, however, that the Barcelona objective will be achieved at the present level of effort, because the acquisition of two languages in addition to one\u2019s mother tongue is very time-consuming and difficult. Only a very few people do so without a definite goal. The Member States should effectively motivate their citizens, and also each other\u2019s citizens, for instance by fully implementing free movement of labour.\nThe European language proficiency indicator is, however, primarily important for motivating the Member States\u2019 own citizens in creating a certain comparative and competitive advantage. It would be dangerous for both Europe, and for language itself, to be limited to only one universal language. This would cause language to be torn out of the ground without its roots. For instance, language professors from Cambridge have difficulty understanding supposedly English-language texts that come from Brussels.\nFor this reason, I would particularly like to emphasise that not only language proficiency, but also the cultures connected with those languages should be promoted on the European level. Unfortunately I am only able to speak in Estonian, my mother tongue, at every tenth session of the European Parliament\u2019s Cultural and Educational Commission \u2013 what an irony in a multicultural Europe.\nI hope this report helps to launch a much-needed programme for the promotion of multilingualism in Europe.

I consider linguistic knowledge to be an integral part of life-long learning for EU citizens, and the report submitted by Mr\u00a0Maurommatis adds another tile to the mosaic of European education, rightly complementing existing plans and programmes in the area of education. The theme of language learning is important not only in terms of simplifying communication and mobility for students and employees in the European Union, but also for evaluating the skills gained during the life-long learning of citizens.\nAs a rapporteur of the Committee on Culture and Education dealing with drafting the European Qualifications Framework, which is primarily designed to set up a\u00a0reference structure to transfer and recognise qualifications, I\u00a0find it important to establish reliable systems for measuring progress and verifying language proficiency.

Would this level of communication be achieved in the most efficient and most economic way? My answer to both of these questions is no. To substantiate my position, let me use the example of our Parliament, which represents a much-scaled-down model of the multilingual EU.\nIn this House, representing 25 Member States, we communicate using 20 different languages.

(SK) Ladies and gentlemen, it is always interesting to talk about culture and languages. In this instance, however, I would like to point out that the Indicator of Language Competence is an instrument for learning languages rather than for assessing their specific use in a social, economic or other context. Admittedly, it is necessary to improve, accelerate and enhance language teaching so that languages become a bridge rather than a barrier. I\u00a0would like to emphasise that language and linguistic skills represent a\u00a0bridge. We would be isolated islands without bridges, and bridges help us form communities.\nA single language does not suffice \u2013 \u2018English only is not enough\u2019 \u2013 as Europe is defined by diversity. Diversity within unity is the best description of our community, but I am convinced that unity has never been and will never be defined by a single language. A family, a company, a small community or a city might communicate using a single language, but they often fail to function well, as unity is determined not by language but by the values, beliefs and principles underpinning human relations. Language plays a\u00a0specific role in this process, of course, but it is not the deciding factor.\nI\u00a0would like to confirm that as a policy of the European Commission multilingualism envisages support for minority, regional and neighbouring languages. A specific question has been asked as to why only five languages will be used at the beginning of the test period. This is only the start of a test that will pave the way for all the official languages of the European Union. The Member States have been discussing this topic and will take a decision on it at the Council of Ministers meeting on 19 May. It is clear that the Dutch spoken in Belgium and the Swedish used in Finland will be added to these languages later, as they are both widely taught. The main criterion has been to ensure access to an adequate statistical sample in order to explore this indicator. There is no ulterior motive; our intention is purely professional, namely to develop a high-quality European indicator.

Debate Information\n\n**Date:** April 27, 2006  \n**Topic:** Promoting multilingualism and language learning in the EU (European Indicator of Language Competence)  \n**Number of Contributions:** 17 speakers plus procedural interventions  \n**Focus:** Discussion of the Mavrommatis report on establishing a European Indicator of Language Competence to measure foreign language proficiency across EU Member States\n\n## 2. Executive Summary\n\nThe debate centered on the European Parliament's consideration of establishing a standardized European Indicator of Language Competence to measure citizens' foreign language skills across the EU. While there was broad consensus on the importance of multilingualism, speakers presented divergent views on implementation approaches and language selection criteria.\n\n### Core Support for Multilingualism\n\n**Rapporteur Manolis Mavrommatis (PPE-DE)** presented the foundational argument that \"simply learning a 'lingua franca' is insufficient and fails to reflect Europe's true identity\" [Mavrommatis, 2006-04-27]. He advocated for the Barcelona Council's objective that \"proficiency in at least two foreign languages should form part of the basic set of skills of a typical European living, studying, working and generally circulating in the European Union\" [Mavrommatis, 2006-04-27]. His proposal focused on initially testing the five most widely taught EU languages (English, French, German, Spanish, Italian) with potential expansion to include Polish.\n\n**Commissioner J\u00e1n Fige\u013e** reinforced the Commission's commitment, stating that \"diversity and unity is the best basis for our enlarged European Union in this 21st century and this diversity is strongly represented and built up further by multilingualism\" [Fige\u013e, 2006-04-27]. He outlined concrete next steps including creating a high-level working group and holding a ministerial conference on multilingualism.\n\n### Concerns About Language Selection and Inclusivity\n\nSeveral speakers criticized the limited initial language scope. **Miguel Portas (GUE/NGL)** argued that focusing on only five languages \"would run counter to the Barcelona Summit objectives\" and suggested that \"Turkish, Arabic, Chinese and Russian are important languages in the Union and that the children of immigrants are the closest to being able to speak two languages in addition to their mother tongue\" [Portas, 2006-04-27].\n\n**Zdzis\u0142aw Podka\u0144ski (UEN)** represented Eastern European concerns, noting that despite Slavonic languages being spoken by \"almost one in four\" EU residents, \"not one of them is a Slavonic language\" among the initial five [Podka\u0144ski, 2006-04-27]. He criticized this as \"culturally dominant nations restricting and displacing the culture of smaller ones\" [Podka\u0144ski, 2006-04-27].\n\n### Regional and Minority Language Advocacy\n\n**Henrik Lax (ALDE)** strongly advocated for including regional languages, arguing that \"every language a person learns gives him or her access to a larger cultural dimension\" [Lax, 2006-04-27]. He warned that \"it is neither cosmopolitan in spirit nor compatible with the EU's interests to turn our backs on a large part of our population\" [Lax, 2006-04-27], noting that 46 million EU inhabitants (10% of the population) speak minority languages as their mother tongue.\n\n**Ljudmila Novak (PPE-DE)** specifically called out violations of minority rights, demanding that \"European Union institutions should also play a more important role where there are infringements of minority rights, and should issue serious warnings to countries that guarantee minority rights on paper, but in practice violate their own laws\" [Novak, 2006-04-27].\n\n### Alternative Visions: Global Languages vs. English Dominance\n\n**Thomas Wise (IND/DEM)** presented a contrarian view, arguing that \"the teaching of Mandarin or Cantonese Chinese, Arabic, Hindi and Russian would serve European countries far better than the insular concentration simply on EU languages\" [Wise, 2006-04-27]. He criticized the EU approach as serving \"the dreadful objective of a federal Europe\" [Wise, 2006-04-27].\n\nConversely, **Marios Matsakis (ALDE)** advocated for practical efficiency, noting that \"approximately 38% of EU citizens can use English as a language of communication with French coming second at approximately 14% only\" [Matsakis, 2006-04-27]. He argued that \"the true unity of Europe will be achieved when we have a common working language of communication\" and proposed that \"this second language has to be English\" [Matsakis, 2006-04-27].\n\n### Practical Implementation Concerns\n\n**Karin Resetarits (ALDE)** warned about unintended consequences, arguing that the limited language selection would create \"fatal\" effects where \"no country wants to risk the stigma of being shown by the Language Indicator as bringing up the rear where language skills are concerned\" [Resetarits, 2006-04-27]. She emphasized that \"what matters is not the number of people in Europe who speak one language or another, but the social and economic relations between states\" [Resetarits, 2006-04-27].\n\n**Commissioner Fige\u013e** responded to these concerns by clarifying that \"'English only is not enough' \u2013 as Europe is defined by diversity\" and that \"unity has never been and will never be defined by a single language\" [Fige\u013e, 2006-04-27]. He assured that the initial five-language approach was purely practical, designed to \"ensure access to an adequate statistical sample\" with plans to expand to all official EU languages [Fige\u013e, 2006-04-27].\n\n### Key Recommendations\n\nThe debate produced several actionable proposals:\n1. Implement the European Indicator of Language Competence starting with five languages but with clear expansion plans\n2. Ensure early language learning becomes part of public education systems\n3. Strengthen enforcement of minority language rights across Member States\n4. Create mechanisms for including neighboring and regional languages in future phases\n5. Address equal access to language learning in underdeveloped regions\n\nThe debate ultimately reflected the fundamental tension between practical implementation needs and the EU's commitment to linguistic diversity, with most speakers supporting multilingualism while disagreeing on the best path forward.", "src_model": "claude", "model_type": "claude", "model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "structured": false, "incremental": false, "hierarchical": false, "grouped": false, "shuffle": false, "prompt": false, "lang": "english"}
