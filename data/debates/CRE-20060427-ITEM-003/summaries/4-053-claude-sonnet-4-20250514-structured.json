In this instance, however, I would like to point out that the Indicator of Language Competence is an instrument for learning languages rather than for assessing their specific use in a social, economic or other context. Admittedly, it is necessary to improve, accelerate and enhance language teaching so that languages become a bridge rather than a barrier. I\u00a0would like to emphasise that language and linguistic skills represent a\u00a0bridge. We would be isolated islands without bridges, and bridges help us form communities.\nA single language does not suffice \u2013 \u2018English only is not enough\u2019 \u2013 as Europe is defined by diversity. Diversity within unity is the best description of our community, but I am convinced that unity has never been and will never be defined by a single language. A family, a company, a small community or a city might communicate using a single language, but they often fail to function well, as unity is determined not by language but by the values, beliefs and principles underpinning human relations. Language plays a\u00a0specific role in this process, of course, but it is not the deciding factor.\nI\u00a0would like to confirm that as a policy of the European Commission multilingualism envisages support for minority, regional and neighbouring languages. A specific question has been asked as to why only five languages will be used at the beginning of the test period. This is only the start of a test that will pave the way for all the official languages of the European Union. The Member States have been discussing this topic and will take a decision on it at the Council of Ministers meeting on 19 May. It is clear that the Dutch spoken in Belgium and the Swedish used in Finland will be added to these languages later, as they are both widely taught. The main criterion has been to ensure access to an adequate statistical sample in order to explore this indicator. There is no ulterior motive; our intention is purely professional, namely to develop a high-quality European indicator. In conclusion, I would again like to thank the rapporteur and the entire Committee.
