{"speaker": "Miguel Portas,", "english": "Miguel Portas, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group . \u2013 (PT) The creation of a European indicator of language competence is something on which we can all agree. That being said, there are some comments I should like to make. The Commission explains that the Indicator will be obtained by written exams, \u2018for practical reasons\u2019. I understand this, but I cannot understand why those same practical reasons are behind the decision to assess, and I quote, \u2018the five most widely-spoken languages in the EU\u2019. The Indicator thus obtained would run counter to the Barcelona Summit objectives, because the choice of languages establishes working guidelines for Member States interested in obtaining results. The objective that we share, that every child should learn to speak at least two languages apart from their mother tongue, can be assessed.\nPlease note, Mr Figel', the Indicator is obtained by sample and via written exams. There is no practical reason why people should not be able to learn any language in the EU area. If the tests are applied to the world of languages, the conclusions might be surprising. One might find, for example, that Turkish, Arabic, Chinese and Russian are important languages in the Union and that the children of immigrants are the closest to being able to speak two languages in addition to their mother tongue. This is why we voted in favour of the Resetarits amendments.\nI should briefly like to make a second comment. The Indicator should not be confused with the certificate of language knowledge. The harmonisation of language certificates is not a cultural measure and is not socially neutral. With populist policies and public opinion divided over immigration policy, such a measure could legitimise discriminatory policies of selecting immigrants, to the detriment of the poorest countries in the Union.", "lang": "PT", "original": "Miguel Portas, em nome do Grupo GUE/NGL . \u2013 A cria\u00e7\u00e3o de um indicador de compet\u00eancia lingu\u00edstica fi\u00e1vel e cred\u00edvel \u00e9 consensual entre n\u00f3s. Contudo, ficam aqui algumas reflex\u00f5es: o indicador, explica a Comiss\u00e3o, ser\u00e1 obtido atrav\u00e9s de testes escritos e cito \"por raz\u00f5es pr\u00e1ticas\".

O indicador assim obtido contraria os objectivos da Cimeira de Barcelona, porque a selec\u00e7\u00e3o de l\u00ednguas estabelece uma orienta\u00e7\u00e3o de trabalho para os Estados interessados na obten\u00e7\u00e3o de resultados. O objectivo que partilhamos, que cada crian\u00e7a aprenda a dominar pelo menos duas l\u00ednguas para al\u00e9m da l\u00edngua materna, pode ser medido.\nRepare, Senhor Figel', o indicador \u00e9 obtido por amostra e atrav\u00e9s de teste escrito. N\u00e3o h\u00e1 qualquer raz\u00e3o pr\u00e1tica que impe\u00e7a o conhecimento sobre o dom\u00ednio de qualquer l\u00edngua no espa\u00e7o da Uni\u00e3o. Se os testes forem aplicados ao universo das l\u00ednguas, talvez cheguemos a conclus\u00f5es surpreendentes, nomeadamente que o turco ou o \u00e1rabe, o chin\u00eas ou o russo s\u00e3o l\u00ednguas importantes na Uni\u00e3o e que os filhos dos imigrantes s\u00e3o os que mais perto se encontram de dominarem duas l\u00ednguas para al\u00e9m da l\u00edngua materna.
