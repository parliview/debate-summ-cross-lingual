{"speaker": "J\u00e1n Fige\u013e,", "english": "J\u00e1n Fige\u013e, Member of the Commission . Mr President, I am very grateful for this report and I congratulate the rapporteur Mr Mavrommatis on his contribution and thank him for his comments and especially for the work and spirit which is embodied in this report.\nI am sure that diversity and unity is the best basis for our enlarged European Union in this 21st century and this diversity is strongly represented and built up further by multilingualism.\nI have just come from the first conference within the EU on minority and regional languages at the Centre Borschette. We believe that it is this diversity that makes Europe and in terms of culture and languages it should be protected and promoted. A new framework strategy for multilingualism adopted in November 2005 is a first multilingualism policy. The European Indicator of Language Competence is a very important instrument for making real progress in the area of multilingualism, which means language teaching, language learning and communication between different language communities in Europe.\nMr Mavrommatis called on the Commission to encourage early language learning. We are currently funding a study of best practice in early language learning and the communication invites Member States to review their arrangements for early language learning in the light of best practice across Europe. As you rightly pointed out, it is a Member State competence, so that is why we need the Member States to be even more active.\nI also note the emphasis on awareness raising through initiatives such as the European Day of Languages or the European Language Label. We strongly support this type of grassroots activity.\nFurther steps ahead of us are, for example, the creation of a high-level working group on multilingualism to develop new ideas and initiatives in this area. This high-level group will start work before this summer. On the basis of Member States\u2019 reports in response to the Commission\u2019s November communication and on the basis of the advice of this high-level group, I will present a further communication to Parliament and to the Council proposing a comprehensive approach to multilingualism in the European Union next year. We also plan to hold a ministerial conference on multilingualism next year in order to share the progress Member States have made and to plan future work.\nThe Indicator of Language Competence is a highly valuable contribution in this area. Since there is no existing standardised survey of language skills across the Union, it is necessary to collect accurate and up-to-date data on the effectiveness of foreign language teaching. This indicator will show us a general level of foreign language knowledge. With such an instrument we will be able to improve more significantly the teaching and learning of foreign languages and, of course, increase the mobility of students and workers in our Union.\nIn conclusion, I want to repeat my gratitude to the rapporteur and also to the Committee on Culture and Education and its Chairman Mr Sifunakis for their very valuable and continuous support for our programmes and policies. This report on multilingualism clearly demonstrates how Parliament can help the Commission and Council in our common commitment to promote diversity.", "lang": "EN", "original": "J\u00e1n Fige\u013e, Member of the Commission .
