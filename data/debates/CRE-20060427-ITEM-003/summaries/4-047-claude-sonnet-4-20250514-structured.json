{"speaker": "Ljudmila Novak (PPE-DE). \u2013", "english": "Ljudmila Novak (PPE-DE). \u2013 (SL) Every nation is proud of its language and wishes to preserve and use it in a united Europe too. The cultural image of Europe is enriched by linguistic diversity. And by learning foreign languages we also become acquainted with a nation\u2019s culture, its history and its land and this also contributes to greater mutual respect.\nLearning foreign languages is a real struggle for adults but for children it is more often than not a game. It is therefore right and proper that we should introduce into schools the teaching of two foreign languages even in the earliest stages of education. Knowing other languages also makes it easier for us to establish friendly ties with other peoples, and this is especially important for the peoples of neighbouring countries, since it is with our neighbours that we usually have most in common and also the largest number of problems.\nFor this reason it is sometimes beyond comprehension that certain politicians should build their political power on the limiting of the rights of minorities to use their mother tongue, as is happening to the Slovenian minority in Austrian Carinthia and the minority in Italy. Austria and Slovenia cooperate closely in various fields, and I am certain therefore that Austria\u2019s democratic public does not approve of Mr\u00a0Haider\u2019s anti-Slovenian actions.\nThe Austrian Presidency of the European Union has been exemplary. I would therefore call once again upon the government and democratic people of Austria to abide by the Austrian State Treaty, which lays down the rights of minorities. I would also call upon the Italian Government to begin to implement the law protecting the Slovenian minority.\nEuropean Union institutions should also play a more important role where there are infringements of minority rights, and should issue serious warnings to countries that guarantee minority rights on paper, but in practice violate their own laws and also the rules of the European Union.\n(Applause)", "lang": "SL", "original": "Ljudmila Novak (PPE-DE). \u2013 Vsak narod je ponosen na svoj jezik in ga \u017eeli ohraniti in uporabljati tudi v zdru\u017eeni Evropi.

Zato s tega mesta \u0161e enkrat pozivam avstrijsko vlado in demokrati\u010dno javnost k spo\u0161tovanju avstrijske dr\u017eavne pogodbe, v kateri so zapisane pravice manj\u0161in.
