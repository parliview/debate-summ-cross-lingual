Although there was no ban on learning French or English in the region, there was certainly lack of motivation. Hence the great significance of the European Union\u2019s language policy, which requires citizens in the Member States to start learning a first foreign language between the ages of 6 to 12, for example, and to begin a second after the age of 12. The principle of learning two foreign languages is excellent. It will broaden our intellectual scope, particularly in the case of representatives of popular languages.\nThe European Indicator of Language Competence is very appropriate, because assessment, examinations and diplomas are a source of motivation. They constitute a reward for work and encourage further development. I cannot, however, agree to including only the five most commonly used or taught languages in the first phase. We must not handicap ourselves from the outset. For instance, Polish is not a very popular language at present, but Poland is a large country, and it could soon generate significant interest in our language too.", "lang": "PL", "original": "Jan Tadeusz Masiel (NI). \u2013 Panie Przewodnicz\u0105cy!
