{"speaker": "Milan Ga\u013ea (PPE-DE). \u2013", "english": "Milan Ga\u013ea (PPE-DE). \u2013 (SK) Mr\u00a0President, ladies and gentlemen, as a\u00a0member of the Committee on Culture and Education I\u00a0would like to state that this Committee has respected the principle of subsidiarity and has taken into consideration national interests while successfully pursuing the European legislative framework for the areas under its political purview. These areas include the adoption of norms for Europass, the European City of Culture, the report on key skills for life-long learning, the European Qualifications Framework, digital libraries and many other areas. Mr\u00a0Manolis\u00a0Maurommatis\u2019s report on measures to promote multilingualism and language learning in the EU Union \u2013 the European Indicator of Language Competence \u2013 is another such example, and I\u00a0would like to take this opportunity to thank him for his work.\nThe report focuses on a common goal set out in the Lisbon Strategy, namely the goal of a knowledge-based society. I consider linguistic knowledge to be an integral part of life-long learning for EU citizens, and the report submitted by Mr\u00a0Maurommatis adds another tile to the mosaic of European education, rightly complementing existing plans and programmes in the area of education. The theme of language learning is important not only in terms of simplifying communication and mobility for students and employees in the European Union, but also for evaluating the skills gained during the life-long learning of citizens.\nAs a rapporteur of the Committee on Culture and Education dealing with drafting the European Qualifications Framework, which is primarily designed to set up a\u00a0reference structure to transfer and recognise qualifications, I\u00a0find it important to establish reliable systems for measuring progress and verifying language proficiency. As there is not enough information at present to evaluate the language skills of EU citizens properly, I\u00a0am convinced that the proposed European Indicator of Language Competence should provide a key yardstick to be used by EU Member States.", "lang": "SK", "original": "Milan Ga\u013ea (PPE-DE). \u2013 V\u00e1\u017een\u00fd p\u00e1n predsedaj\u00faci, v\u00e1\u017een\u00e9 d\u00e1my a p\u00e1ni.
