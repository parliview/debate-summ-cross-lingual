{"speaker": "Erna Hennicot-Schoepges,", "english": "Erna Hennicot-Schoepges, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . \u2013 (FR) Mr\u00a0President, I should like to begin by congratulating our rapporteur on his excellent work.\nAs you know, my country, Luxembourg, is in favour of multilingualism, and perhaps on more than one account. It is, in fact, a country that does not insist on using its own national language, Luxemburgish, and in which people do not hesitate to speak German, French and English. It is a country that is careful not to overemphasise the status of its own language in the context of its actions.\nIn a way, multilingualism is the best means of promoting the unity of Europe; it is the best means of promoting mutual understanding. Yet, multilingualism is also the sign of our diversity, and the disappearance of languages spoken in a limited area must be of concern to us. We must ensure that languages that are still spoken also have the means to survive, even if it means including them within a multilingual context, otherwise we will not be able to understand each other. The measures taken by the Commission, which aim to encourage the learning of languages of neighbouring countries, are very welcome. It is this move that must lead us not only to promote the languages spoken, but also to take measures to understand our fellow citizens.\nMr\u00a0President, I will not hide from you the fact that I have some anxieties about the future of our European schools. We know that our officials, who are growing in number, are often called upon to move; besides, we are in the Year of Workers' Mobility. We should therefore provide for the school system in all of the European countries, in general, and make multilingualism more accessible, in particular.", "lang": "FR", "original": "Erna Hennicot-Schoepges, au nom du groupe PPE-DE . - Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, je voudrais f\u00e9liciter tout d\u2019abord notre rapporteur pour son excellent travail.\nComme vous le savez, le pays d\u2019o\u00f9 je viens, le Luxembourg, est pour le multilinguisme, peut-\u00eatre m\u00eame \u00e0 plus d\u2019un titre.

C\u2019est un pays qui veille \u00e0 ne pas trop mettre en avant, dans le cadre de ses actions, le statut de sa propre langue.\nEn quelque sorte, le multilinguisme, c\u2019est le meilleur moyen de promouvoir l\u2019unit\u00e9 de l\u2019Europe, c\u2019est le meilleur moyen de promouvoir la compr\u00e9hension mutuelle.
