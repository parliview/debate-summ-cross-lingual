{"speaker": "Silva Peneda (PPE-DE).", "english": "Silva Peneda (PPE-DE). \u2013 (PT) In recent weeks, the Commission has taken decisions on two key themes: the strategic guidelines for its mandate and the reform of the Lisbon Strategy. Both decisions emphasise the fact that the highest priorities for the EU, in the current circumstances, are reinvigorating economic growth and creating jobs.\nFrankly, I do not understand the argument over which comes first, economic growth or jobs. For me it is simple. Jobs are created in companies. Well, companies only grow and develop when there is a climate of confidence and a widespread desire to create an investment-friendly atmosphere.\nThis approach to life, this culture, will become a reality if the capacity is there to carry out the right economic policies. The greater the commitment among the Member States to implement the necessary reforms, the more quickly such a culture can be introduced. That is the only way in which we can maintain, and indeed develop, the European social model. Economic dynamism must not be seen as the enemy of social protection; it is, in fact, its staunchest ally.\nI have a different concern, however, which relates to the definition of priorities and the clear allocation of responsibilities. It was precisely because of the absence of these elements that reform of the Lisbon Strategy was needed. It is now the duty of the Member States to display the reforming spirit proposed by the Commission through practical political action.\nThere is a pressing need to carry out reforms, which, for the most part, are not popular with the public, but which Europe needs. These reforms will only succeed if they are explained, exhaustively if necessary. That is the only way in which they will be understood and accepted.\nI shall finish by saying that, to my mind, it is worthwhile looking into the benefits of escaping from the office environment and going out onto the street, and, as Members of the European Parliament, we should be the first to do this.", "lang": "PT", "original": "Silva Peneda (PPE-DE). \u2013 Nas \u00faltimas semanas, a Comiss\u00e3o Europeia tomou decis\u00f5es sobre dois temas marcantes: as orienta\u00e7\u00f5es estrat\u00e9gicas para o seu mandato e a reforma da Estrat\u00e9gia de Lisboa. Ambas as decis\u00f5es insistem naquilo que nas actuais circunst\u00e2ncias \u00e9 o mais determinante para a Uni\u00e3o Europeia: o relan\u00e7amento do crescimento econ\u00f3mico e a cria\u00e7\u00e3o de emprego.\nSinceramente, n\u00e3o entendo a discuss\u00e3o sobre quem vem primeiro: se o crescimento econ\u00f3mico ou o emprego. Para mim \u00e9 simples. Os empregos criam-se nas empresas. Ora, as empresas s\u00f3 surgem e se desenvolvem se existir um clima de confian\u00e7a, uma vontade generalizada de empreender o ambiente amigo do investimento.\nEste modo de estar na vida, esta cultura ser\u00e1 uma realidade se houver capacidade para executar pol\u00edticas econ\u00f3micas correctas. E tudo acontecer\u00e1 tanto mais rapidamente quanto mais empenhados andarem os Estados-Membros na concretiza\u00e7\u00e3o das reformas que \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio levar a cabo. Esta \u00e9 a \u00fanica via que nos poder\u00e1 permitir a manuten\u00e7\u00e3o e at\u00e9 o desenvolvimento do modelo social europeu. Portanto, o dinamismo econ\u00f3mico n\u00e3o pode ser visto como inimigo da protec\u00e7\u00e3o social, pelo contr\u00e1rio, \u00e9 o seu principal aliado.\nMas a minha preocupa\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 outra e tem a ver com a defini\u00e7\u00e3o de prioridades e a clareza na atribui\u00e7\u00e3o de responsabilidades. Foi precisamente a aus\u00eancia delas que justificou a reforma da Estrat\u00e9gia de Lisboa. Cabe agora aos Estados-Membros a responsabilidade de concretizarem o \u00edmpeto reformador proposto pela Comiss\u00e3o atrav\u00e9s de ac\u00e7\u00f5es pol\u00edticas concretas.\nEstamos perante a absoluta necessidade de proceder a reformas que, na maior parte dos casos, n\u00e3o s\u00e3o simp\u00e1ticas para a opini\u00e3o p\u00fablica, mas s\u00e3o aquelas que a Europa precisa. Estas reformas s\u00f3 ser\u00e3o bem sucedidas se forem explicadas, se necess\u00e1rio, at\u00e9 \u00e0 exaust\u00e3o. S\u00f3 assim, poder\u00e3o ser entendidas e aceites.\nConcluo dizendo que, na minha opini\u00e3o, penso que vale a pena estudar as vantagens em sair do ambiente dos gabinetes e ir para a rua come\u00e7ando por n\u00f3s pr\u00f3prios, deputados europeus.", "agenda_item": "Commission legislative and work programme (2005) (continuation of debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20050221-ITEM-013", "intervention_id": "1-094", "summary_english": "```json\n{\n  \"headline\": \"Economic Growth and Jobs Creation Require Investment-Friendly Policies and Member State Reform Commitment\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"The speaker addresses the Commission's strategic guidelines focusing on economic growth and job creation, the reform of the Lisbon Strategy, and the need for Member States to implement necessary but unpopular reforms.
