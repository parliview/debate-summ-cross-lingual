Thank you.

I would do so whether the person in question was Mr\u00a0Schulz or the chairman of any group or party, and I would do so regardless of whether that person was a Socialist, a Green, a Catholic or an adherent of any other political movement or religion. If the event concerned promoted social and psychological unity and the creation of a common Europe, then it would deserve genuine respect. I believe that Mr\u00a0Schulz will acknowledge that this is the case, and indeed I can see him nodding in agreement. I should like to thank him for that.\nI should also like to remind Members from the ten new Member States, and not only those from the Group of the European People\u2019s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, but also those who are Socialists, Greens, Communists or non-attached Members, that it is thanks to the Pope and his actions that we are able to discuss a common Europe together today. If it were not for him, we would still be unable to hold such a meeting, and I should like to remind Mr\u00a0Schulz that this was mainly the Pope\u2019s doing, and that Mr\u00a0Kov\u00e1cs only played a small part at most. If Members are not aware of this fact, or have forgotten it, I should like to remind them most strongly of it, and encourage them to vote in favour of this grant, which will allow the meeting to be held in an appropriate fashion and ensure it will be a great success.
