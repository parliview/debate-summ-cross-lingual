{"speaker": "Goebbels (PSE).", "english": "Goebbels (PSE). \u2013 (FR) Mr\u00a0President, President Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to make a few personal observations on the Commission\u2019s Work Programme. This is a splendid inventory of the kind once drawn up by the poet Jacques Pr\u00e9vert, but it reminds one of what Wim Kok used to say about the Lisbon Process, \u2018Lisbon is about everything and thus about nothing\u2019. The Commission\u2019s Work Programme is a rather similar case, where one cannot see the wood for the trees. Each Commissioner has done his or her best to decorate their own Christmas tree by hanging a few bits of tinsel of their own upon it.\nI am not criticising you, Mr\u00a0President. If you had confined yourself to what was essential, the Members of this House would have been the first to say that you had forgotten this or that issue they considered more important. Nonetheless, I would ask you to devote your energies to what is essential. Europe must defend its social and environmental models. We all agree that Europe must carry out reforms and be more flexible in certain areas. You will not, however, win the support of Europeans by voting in favour of what the right is preparing to vote in favour of tomorrow when I present my report, that is to say less tax for the rich and more labour for the workers. That will not work.\nIn its 2005 annual report, the Economic Policy Committee said that Europe needs a macroeconomic framework supportive of stability and growth and that such a framework is indispensable, but that governments will reap the full benefits of structural reforms in terms of growth and employment only in an appropriate macroeconomic environment.
