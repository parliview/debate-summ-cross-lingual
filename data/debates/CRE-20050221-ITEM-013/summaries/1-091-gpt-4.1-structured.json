{"speaker": "Roure (PSE).", "english": "Roure (PSE). \u2013 (FR) Mr\u00a0President, Mr President of the Commission, as we know, it is the Commission\u2019s legislative programme that enables us to translate the Council\u2019s political priorities into practical actions. We are therefore pleased to note that priority has been given to the implementation of European legislation, but we want firm commitments for future years.\nThe strengthening of security in Europe does indeed remain a priority, yet it must not on any account be strengthened at the expense of civil liberties. The proposals that have been put forward on improving the exchange of information and strengthening operational cooperation are a step forward in the fight against terrorism and organised crime, but Europeans\u2019 feelings of insecurity, which we acknowledge, must above all be combated through an active policy of protecting and promoting fundamental rights. That is how our democracies must defend themselves, and that is how they will win the day.\nWe want initiatives to be taken with a view to combating racism, xenophobia and forms of discrimination. The strengthening of judicial cooperation remains one of the priority measures to be taken in order to ensure that Europeans have the same rights and the same access to justice everywhere in Europe. We therefore welcome plans to extend judicial cooperation to include certain aspects of family law. We call upon the Commission to maintain this commitment and to present proposals based on the principle of mutual recognition in the areas of the evaluation and use of evidence and procedural guarantees. We wish to see a fairer approach adopted to asylum and immigration issues, namely one that will above all enable rights to be respected and burdens and responsibilities to be shared. We want to see legal immigration channels opened whereby migrants\u2019 basic needs and rights are respected. Finally, we ask that significant progress be made on the matter of defining minimum standards for granting and withdrawing refugee status.", "lang": "FR", "original": "Roure (PSE). - Madame la Pr\u00e9sidente, Monsieur le pr\u00e9sident de la Commission, c\u2019est le programme l\u00e9gislatif de la Commission, nous le savons, qui permet de traduire les priorit\u00e9s politiques du Conseil en actions concr\u00e8tes. Nous appr\u00e9cions donc de constater que la priorit\u00e9 est accord\u00e9e \u00e0 la mise en \u0153uvre de la l\u00e9gislation europ\u00e9enne, mais nous souhaitons des engagements fermes pour les ann\u00e9es \u00e0 venir.\nEn effet, le renforcement de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 en Europe reste une priorit\u00e9. Il ne doit cependant en aucun cas se faire au d\u00e9triment des libert\u00e9s civiles.

C\u2019est ainsi que nos d\u00e9mocraties doivent se d\u00e9fendre, et c\u2019est ainsi qu\u2019elles gagneront.\nNous voulons que des initiatives soient prises afin de lutter contre les discriminations, le racisme et la x\u00e9nophobie.

Nous accueillons donc favorablement l\u2019extension pr\u00e9vue de la coop\u00e9ration judiciaire \u00e0 certains aspects du droit de la famille. Nous appelons la Commission \u00e0 tenir cet engagement et \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter des propositions bas\u00e9es sur le principe de reconnaissance mutuelle dans les domaines de l\u2019\u00e9valuation et de l\u2019utilisation des preuves et des garanties proc\u00e9durales. Nous souhaitons voir adopter une approche plus juste sur les questions d\u2019asile et d\u2019immigration, qui permette avant tout le respect des droits et le partage des charges et des responsabilit\u00e9s. Nous souhaitons une ouverture des voies l\u00e9gales d\u2019immigration qui respecte les besoins et les droits fondamentaux des migrants.
