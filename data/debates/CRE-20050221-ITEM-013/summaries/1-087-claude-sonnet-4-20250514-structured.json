{"speaker": "Kirkhope (PPE-DE).", "english": "Kirkhope (PPE-DE). \u2013 Mr President, this programme offers real hope for the revitalisation and refocusing of the Lisbon Agenda. However, as we approach the Spring Council next month, it is vital that national governments get a grip and push ahead with the economic reforms that are vital to the future prosperity envisaged in the programme.\nIn recent weeks, I have been impressed by the statements by the President of the Commission and his clear aim of putting growth and prosperity at the heart of his strategy for the period ahead. Similarly, I am unimpressed by the rantings of Socialists, like Mr Schulz, on refocusing priorities within the Lisbon process. The left in Europe remain wedded to the old ways of inflexible labour markets, high non-wage labour costs and other barriers to growth.\nCan they not see that it is precisely because of the old social model that Europe is today in relative economic decline? Can they not understand that the high unemployment in so many parts of Europe is caused by the very outmoded proposals that they cling on to in economic terms? Nothing Mr Schulz has just said would help any of the five million presently unemployed in his country. Therefore we continue to urge the Commission President to keep up the pace on reform, and we urge the governments to take heed of the reasons for the failure of the Lisbon Agenda in the first five years.\nWe want to see a renewed commitment to the completion of the single market. Mr Barroso sensibly understands that many remedies for the lack of economic dynamism lie in the hands of Member States themselves. However, in addition to the lead he has taken, I would encourage him to put real effort into reducing the legislative output from the Commission itself.\nThe Commission must be as efficient as it is requiring our businesses and citizens to be. He rightly talks about better regulation, but the priority must be less regulation and, crucially, that legislation must be subject to full impact assessment. British Conservative MEPs have been at the forefront of campaigning for less regulation and enforcing such impact assessments. I look forward to, and am confident that I will see, some progress soon on all these issues in relation to the Services Directive, which I am so pleased he supports.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Kirkhope (PPE-DE). \u2013 Mr President, this programme offers real hope for the revitalisation and refocusing of the Lisbon Agenda.
