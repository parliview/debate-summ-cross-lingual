  "english": "Kirkhope (PPE-DE). – Mr President, this programme offers real hope for the revitalisation and refocusing of the Lisbon Agenda. However, as we approach the Spring Council next month, it is vital that national governments get a grip and push ahead with the economic reforms that are vital to the future prosperity envisaged in the programme.\nIn recent weeks, I have been impressed by the statements by the President of the Commission and his clear aim of putting growth and prosperity at the heart of his strategy for the period ahead. Similarly, I am unimpressed by the rantings of Socialists, like Mr Schulz, on refocusing priorities within the Lisbon process. The left in Europe remain wedded to the old ways of inflexible labour markets, high non-wage labour costs and other barriers to growth.\nCan they not see that it is precisely because of the old social model that Europe is today in relative economic decline? Can they not understand that the high unemployment in so many parts of Europe is caused by the very outmoded proposals that they cling on to in economic terms? Nothing Mr Schulz has just said would help any of the five million presently unemployed in his country. Therefore we continue to urge the Commission President to keep up the pace on reform, and we urge the governments to take heed of the reasons for the failure of the Lisbon Agenda in the first five years.\nWe want to see a renewed commitment to the completion of the single market. Mr Barroso sensibly understands that many remedies for the lack of economic dynamism lie in the hands of Member States themselves. However, in addition to the lead he has taken, I would encourage him to put real effort into reducing the legislative output from the Commission itself.\nThe Commission must be as efficient as it is requiring our businesses and citizens to be. He rightly talks about better regulation, but the priority must be less regulation and, crucially, that legislation must be subject to full impact assessment. British Conservative MEPs have been at the forefront of campaigning for less regulation and enforcing such impact assessments. I look forward to, and am confident that I will see, some progress soon on all these issues in relation to the Services Directive, which I am so pleased he supports.",

    "headline": "Kirkhope Calls for Economic Reforms, Less Regulation, and Completion of Single Market in Response to Commission Work Programme",
    "issueSum": "The speaker addresses the revitalisation and refocusing of the Lisbon Agenda through the Commission's legislative and work programme for 2005. Key issues include the need for economic reform, the importance of promoting growth and prosperity, high unemployment rates, inflexible labour markets, over-regulation, and barriers to a dynamic single market.",
    "positionSum": "Kirkhope expresses strong support for economic reforms centered on growth and prosperity, criticizes the 'old social model' upheld by socialist politicians as a cause for economic decline and unemployment, and advocates for less EU regulation. He also stresses the urgency for national governments to actively implement reforms and for the Commission to reduce the quantity of legislation it produces.",
    "argSum": "To justify his position, Kirkhope argues that inflexible labour markets and high non-wage costs are primary barriers to economic growth and the reasons for high unemployment. He asserts that current socialist approaches perpetuate decline, and that real solutions lie in reform, completion of the single market, and regulatory reduction. He also highlights the importance of full impact assessments on legislation.",
    "propSum": "Kirkhope proposes a renewed commitment to completing the single market, urges for less legislation and better (more efficient) regulation by the Commission, and advocates for mandatory full impact assessments for new laws. He supports the Commission President's direction, particularly regarding the Services Directive.",

    "issueSum": "The key issues raised by the speaker concern the need to revitalize the Lisbon Agenda, address high unemployment and economic decline in Europe, complete the single market, and reduce excessive regulation from the European Commission.",
    "positionSum": "Kirkhope strongly supports the Commission President's focus on growth, prosperity, and economic reform. He is critical of socialist opposition to reform, arguing that their adherence to inflexible labour markets and high costs contributes to economic stagnation and unemployment. He advocates for less regulation and urges national governments and the Commission to proceed more assertively with reforms.",
    "argSum": "Kirkhope argues that Europe's relative economic decline and high unemployment are direct consequences of holding on to outdated social and economic policies. He believes that real improvement depends on government willingness to implement necessary structural reforms and on reducing the legislative burden on businesses.",
    "propSum": "He calls for renewed efforts to complete the single market, reduction in the legislative output from the Commission, a shift toward better and less regulation (with full impact assessments), and support for the Services Directive.",
