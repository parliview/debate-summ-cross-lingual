If you really want us to achieve prosperity, solidarity and security for our citizens, you will have to deal a great deal more thoroughly with this directive on services than you seemed to indicate today.\nIf you are serious about your partnership with us, and indeed with all the institutions, you will have to go much further yet. Moreover, we must not forget something that is even more important, Mr\u00a0Barroso, and that is our partnership with the people of the European Union, with all of its 450 million inhabitants.

Herr Barroso, Sie haben Ihre heutige Rede unter ein sch\u00f6nes Motto gestellt: Wohlstand, Solidarit\u00e4t und Sicherheit! Das weckt nat\u00fcrlich sehr hohe Erwartungen bei uns Abgeordneten, und ich muss sagen, mir ging es genauso wie Herrn Swoboda: Was Sie \u00fcber die Dienstleistungsrichtlinie in diesem Zusammenhang gesagt haben, war dann doch recht d\u00fcrftig. Wenn Sie wirklich wollen, dass wir f\u00fcr die B\u00fcrgerinnen und B\u00fcrger Wohlstand, Solidarit\u00e4t und Sicherheit erreichen, m\u00fcssen Sie sehr viel tiefgreifender an diese Dienstleistungsrichtlinie herangehen, als Sie es heute angedeutet haben.\nWenn Sie die Partnerschaft mit uns, mit allen Institutionen, ernst meinen, dann werden Sie noch viel weiter gehen m\u00fcssen. Und eines, was noch wichtiger ist, Herr Barroso, d\u00fcrfen wir auf keinen Fall vergessen: Partnerschaft mit den B\u00fcrgerinnen und B\u00fcrgern der Europ\u00e4ischen Union, und zwar mit allen 450 Millionen B\u00fcrgerinnen und B\u00fcrgern.
