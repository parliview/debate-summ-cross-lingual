{"speaker": "Brejc, Mihael (PPE-DE).", "english": "Brejc, Mihael (PPE-DE). (SL) Thank you, Mr President. The Commission has drawn up an extensive and ambitious programme. It has drawn up priority tasks which I agree with and support. I am also pleased by the ambition, energy and of course the enthusiasm of the Commission President. Yet if we want Europe to be effective, if we want Europe to be closer to its citizens and if we wish to achieve the objectives, then we must act much more effectively than hitherto ourselves. An important part of the European Union\u2019s effectiveness is its administrative systems, its public administration. You mention them in the strategic objectives on page four, Mr President. This is very pleasing. Yet at the same time I recall that the Prodi Commission began the reform of public administration in the European Union. Former Commissioner Kinnock was responsible for this. While I am unaware of how the whole thing ended, if indeed it was ever started, the fact remains that the citizens of the European Union see this as a great bureaucratic apparatus, removed from the people, an apparatus which costs a great deal and which requires an extremely large amount of administration for every trifling thing, not to mention major projects. So all of us together, not just those of us here in the European Parliament, but also our electorates, justifiably expect the new Commission to find, within the framework of the priority tasks you have set out, the energy, time and will to deal with its own administrative system, with its own bureaucracy. In this regard I anticipate very clear answers. And one more thing! Good legislation is fine, but what is more important is that we actually put good legislation into practice.
