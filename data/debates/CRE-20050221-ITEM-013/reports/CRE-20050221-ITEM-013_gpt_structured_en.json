(PT) Mr President, eminent Members of the European Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, before I address you on the Commission\u2019s legislative and work programme for 2005, I should like briefly to express my satisfaction with the results of yesterday\u2019s referendum on the European Constitution in Spain and I shall try to do this in Spanish.\n(ES) The Spanish people have said yes to the European Constitution, a clear and resounding yes.\n(Applause)\nI would like to express to you the European Commission\u2019s satisfaction with this result. Spain has said yes to a Europe united in its diversity. I would like to thank everybody who has participated in the referendum process with such commitment, in particular all the Members of this Parliament who have contributed with their voices and opinions to achieving this significant result. In this regard, I called the President of the Spanish Government, Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero, yesterday to congratulate him and thank him for the great commitment demonstrated by his government during the referendum campaign.\nThis \u2018yes\u2019, expressed clearly and unreservedly, opens the way for the other European citizens who will also be called upon to express their opinions on the European Constitution over the coming months.\nThis has been a very important step in the process of ratifying the European Constitution, which the Commission believes to be the only instrument which will allow us Europeans to consolidate our ideas of peace, prosperity, solidarity and security in Europe.\nMr President, one month ago I presented the Commission's proposed strategic objectives, designed to guide European action until the end of the decade. This is a political roadmap based on three pillars: prosperity, solidarity and security. Being mutually reinforcing, they address the concrete and challenging concerns of European citizens. I also presented the first delivery of the strategic objectives: the legislative work programme for this year. Let me remind you of some of its most important elements.\nFirst of all, the programme is more focused in political terms. The proposed initiatives are structured around the three strategic objectives and their external dimension, and represent a first concrete translation of the balanced approach pursued by the Commission. This applies to new initiatives as well as areas where we propose to reinforce an existing action.\nSecond, the Commission is fully committed to delivering its work programme. For this purpose, the Commission intends to adopt a list of just over 100 priority initiatives by the end of the year.\nFinally, we do not only want to deliver on time \u2013 we also want to deliver in a better way. We want to be serious about the principles of better regulation. This means ensuring quality of legislation; respect for the principles of proportionality, subsidiarity and added value; and widespread use of impact assessments.\nIn addition to this work programme, I announced that the Commission will regularly inform the Parliament about its planning agenda for legislative proposals in preparation. I am happy to be able to say that this information channel is now operational.\nIn the meantime, the Commission has gone further in implementing its proposals. On 2 February, I presented to you our proposals for a mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy. By focusing on growth and jobs, it aims to create the conditions for proper living standards, social justice for all and environmental sustainability. On 6\u00a0January and 2 February we had an initial exchange of views.\nI was pleased to hear that, broadly speaking, the Commission's proposals met many of the expectations and concerns of Members of this House. I welcome the detailed motions for resolutions tabled today by the political groups on the work programme. When we talk about partnership, dialogue and consultation, we know that we will not always agree on everything. As in any partnership, the important thing is to have positions on the table clearly spelt out, and to work together to achieve common objectives.\nI would like to comment briefly on some of the important issues raised in the comments and motions for resolutions.\nFirst, actions count more than words. The European Union has a responsibility to turn its aspirations into reality. It must promote prosperity, cohesion and social justice, both at home and beyond our borders. The Commission is fully committed to this task. We have already started to work towards this goal by implementing our work programme for 2005: we are on track.\nSecond, competitiveness and social cohesion need to go hand in hand. We all know that striking a balance is difficult. I want the Commission to be helpful in this regard. This requires listening carefully to your opinions and contributions.\nTake the REACH initiative, for example. Let me assure you that we have taken due note of the concerns expressed. We all agree on the need to protect the safety of individuals and the environment properly. On the other hand, we should also address the fear that certain elements of the proposal would put a key European industry in serious difficulty without adding real value in the fields of health and the environment. Throughout the legislative process, we will continue to look into further possibilities to refine and improve the balance between regulation and competitiveness.\nWith regard to the draft services directive, here too we are pursuing an aim which commands general support \u2013 the completion of the single market for services by 2010. Again I can assure you that we have taken due note of the concerns expressed. I am fully convinced that, via the legislative process, we will be able to settle upon an instrument which will tap the single market's hidden potential without jeopardising legitimate public interest objectives.\nLet us do this on an informed basis and dispel the myths. Our proposals do not call into question the responsibility of Member States when it comes to organising and financing key public services as required by their societal needs, nor do they undermine the rules on the posting of workers as laid down in the directive.\nFinally, I shall mention the Stability and Growth Pact. The Commission is committed to helping improve the pact and ensuring it fully complies with the Treaty. The improvements proposed by the Commission aim to increase its economic rationale and refine its implementation. We want better incentives to foster 'good policies' in 'good times'. We want a better definition of the medium-term objectives of fiscal policy by taking into account elements such as the debt level and the up-front costs of structural reforms. We want to avoid undesirable fiscal restraint in a downturn, because, ultimately, we want our budgets to be in a position to enhance prosperity by focusing expenditure on growth-oriented sectors and by investing for the future.\nThese are not academic issues \u2013 this is about quality of life, people's opportunities to earn a living and reap the benefits of their savings and pensions. This is about the chances of current and future generations to lead as full a life as they can legitimately expect to.\nAs part of this balanced approach, the Commission has made progress via its recently adopted proposal on the revised social agenda for the period up to 2010. This shows the Commission's full commitment to modernising and developing European social systems, to tackling social exclusion and poverty, and to attaining the target of more and better jobs.\nWhen liberalising markets, individuals must not be forgotten. That is why last week we adopted two new proposals to strengthen passengers' rights. This brings me to a key issue: the European Union needs to be given sufficient financial means to act. Cohesion policy is and must remain central to the purpose of the Union. Without solidarity, we can never be united. It is an essential complement to competitiveness and the Lisbon Strategy \u2013 raising prosperity levels in the less-developed regions of the Union benefits the Union as a whole.\nWe should also bear in mind that there are now 25 Member States. The new Member States are waiting for tangible proof of our solidarity. This is why our proposals for a new generation of cohesion policies for the next Financial Perspective are of critical importance for the Union, both economically and politically. We cannot afford to see our obligations in this area watered down.\nIn addition, the Commission is currently preparing its third package of proposals for the next Financial Perspective, which are based on a careful examination of their European added value with respect to providing citizens with opportunities that complement national approaches or fill existing gaps. This set of instruments will include proposals on the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Development; consumer protection and public health; energy \u2013 including renewable energy sources; competitiveness and innovation in respect of freedom, security and justice.\nThe Commission is doing its work, but making these proposals a reality will very much depend on the terms of the agreement on the Financial Perspectives expected by June. As I said before, I do not see how the Commission can contribute to a Europe which aims to do more, but with less resources.\n(FR) Honourable Members, sustainable development and the issue of climate change are both firmly rooted in the Commission\u2019s agenda. Although we are delighted that the Kyoto Protocol has come into force, we cannot however stop there. On 9\u00a0February, we adopted a communication on sustainable development and another entitled \u2018Winning the battle against global climate change\u2019. These proposals supplement those relating to the mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy. Alongside the economic pillar, the sustainable development strategy and the new social agenda constitute two other supplementary pillars upon which our strategy for the next five years will be based.\nNaturally, we must also look beyond our borders. We shall be able this year to take stock of the progress made in achieving the Millennium Development Goals. The situation is clearly disappointing. The European Union can and must make a larger contribution to achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Next month, we shall publish our contribution to the current review exercise. We must be more dynamic and more imaginative in giving concrete expression to our Monterrey Commitments. In doing so, our main priority will be Africa, and we intend to propose specific new initiatives for Africa.\nMultilateralism and the reinforced Neighbourhood Policy are also priorities for the Commission. Renewed involvement in the peace process in the Middle East and revitalising transatlantic relations are also key objectives. When we meet President Bush tomorrow, we shall share with him our wish for effective multilateralism and our commitment to work for peace and provide humanitarian aid wherever required.\nWe all share the belief that it is our action for the benefit of Europeans that is the source of legitimacy for our daily work. Increasing public involvement is a priority for the Commission and, in order to fulfil this duty, we shall propose a specific programme within the framework of the Financial Perspective. By providing people with simple and transparent information on the subject, they will be in a better position to understand what is at stake in Europe and to form opinions. All the Commissioners \u2013 including, principally, Vice-President Wallstr\u00f6m, whose particular area this is \u2013 have undertaken to exert themselves in this area.\nAllow me, in conclusion, to explain how the Commission, of which I have the honour of being President, intends to meet these shared challenges and address these shared concerns. The method we will use will be partnership, particularly between the European institutions. I should like to repeat what I have already said on many occasions before this House, namely that I intend to develop a constructive rapport between the Commission and the European Parliament. I was delighted to see, during the debate of 26\u00a0January, that President Juncker and many Members of this House agree on the importance of working together on the strategic objectives proposed by the Commission. This would be an unprecedented step towards greater coherence in the action taken by the EU.\nFinally, the Commission wants to work very closely with Parliament in the spirit of the proposed partnership. Vice-President Wallstr\u00f6m will be present tomorrow at the Conference of Committee Chairmen, and this within the framework of what the Commission wishes to be a permanent and regular dialogue concerning the issues that have priority for us, from the points of view both of programming and of establishing political priorities.\nTo summarise, Mr\u00a0President, ladies and gentlemen, I want the Work Programme for 2005 to be the first achievement of the partnership I am proposing to you for the renewal of Europe. I shall be happy to hear now your comments and suggestions regarding its content.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Barroso, President of the Commission .

Your programme is ambitious, and we have every confidence in you \u2013 confidence that we should very much like to re-affirm, as you have been an attentive listener, specifically to ourselves. Indeed, you took the initiative to review the Directive on Services in order to take account of our concerns. The same applies to REACH, as you have just explained to us.\nWe must therefore concentrate on the key issues, namely growth and employment. Fewer laws and better lawmaking will be the main thrust of our work. I know that we are on the same wavelength as you on this subject. You also spoke to us about actions to be taken. Productivity in Europe is increasing half as fast as in the United States, where the average growth in investment is 5.4% per year, compared with 1.7% for European investments.\nWhat our fellow citizens are waiting for are, in fact, practical changes that can be described in simple terms: seeing purchasing power increase and no longer needing to fear unemployment or relocation. It is therefore with impatience that we await your framework programme for competitiveness and innovation, including precise objectives and pre-arranged meetings.\nIncreasing growth and employment means relying upon innovation and research and, above all, reconciling environmental and industrial policies. These two policies are not contradictory, in fact quite the opposite is true; they are complementary. Environmental considerations are not constraints or obstacles. They are assets and present an opportunity for our economy. Europe must therefore opt for eco-innovation and cutting-edge technologies in order to meet a demand for high added value products that our competitors cannot satisfy.\nThanks to its high environmental standards, the European Union stimulates innovation and increases the competitive ability of European industry. I have in mind the development of renewable energy sources, including solar and wind power, of biofuels and of clean forms of transport \u2013 all sectors that offer our industries a real opportunity in terms of employment and exports. We note your proposals in this area with interest, particularly the regulation on the measures to be taken to combat forms of air pollution.\nViable economic development and renewed growth depend above all upon both the health of our companies and the health of the men and women who make our economy work. We value that part of your programme concerning health and consumer policy. Europe must also anticipate the possible threats from major scourges and combat the new epidemics and resistance to antibiotics. It is therefore with great interest that we await the proposal for a directive aimed at putting Community measures in place to combat avian influenza. We shall have to act quickly and effectively.\nRegarding demographic development in Europe, the Green Paper must quickly be followed up by practical measures involving, for example, lifelong learning, health systems that can be relied upon over time and research into neurodegenerative diseases. As far as solidarity policy is concerned, it is only right that the new Member States should benefit from these programmes, but do not forget that the funds in question also convey the image of the European Union across all the Member States. It is therefore vital for all the countries to have access to these forms of structural aid.\nWe also call for greater efficiency in the way in which Member States follow up each other\u2019s judicial decisions, although, on this subject, we were still awaiting the results of the codecision provided for by the Constitution. We know that all this should help improve Europeans\u2019 mobility. In particular, we must also improve young people\u2019s mobility by facilitating university exchanges and having people benefit from the terrific experience constituted by career routes to the professions.\nWe are ambitious, and so are you. We wish to develop and improve working conditions with a view to putting practical measures in place and improving work-life balance. That is how we shall be able to fulfil the objective that the EU must pursue, so enhancing the whole of European society. The European Commission must be visionary in its initiating role.\nIn the field of policy, we would emphasise Euro-Mediterranean relations. Euro-Mediterranean policy must be much stronger and be accorded priority. In the same way, we must turn our attention to our European borders.\nIn conclusion, I should like to say to you that political will must be reflected in a Financial Perspective that is evaluated for what it really is. The Member States cannot ask more of Europe while giving less. What, therefore, we now need is political energy for kick-starting the engine that drives our efforts \u2013 efforts that are the basis of our work. You have that energy. We shall be at your side in that spirit of constructive rapport you mentioned.", "lang": "FR", "original": "Grosset\u00eate (PPE-DE), au nom du groupe . - Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, nous sommes tr\u00e8s heureux que le Pr\u00e9sident Barroso ait pu nous rejoindre et que nous puissions examiner avec lui ce programme\u00a02005 qui avait pris du retard, mais nous en connaissons les raisons.\nNous savons, Monsieur\u00a0Barroso, que vous ferez tout pour redoubler d\u2019efficacit\u00e9. Votre programme est ambitieux et nous vous faisons confiance, une confiance que nous tenons \u00e0 vous renouveler, car vous avez su \u00eatre \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9coute, \u00e0 notre \u00e9coute: vous avez en effet pris l\u2019initiative de revoir la directive relative aux services pour prendre en compte nos pr\u00e9occupations. Il en est de m\u00eame pour REACH, comme vous venez de nous l\u2019expliquer.\nNous devrons donc nous concentrer sur l\u2019essentiel: la croissance et l\u2019emploi. Moins et mieux l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer sera notre axe de travail. Je sais que nous sommes en phase avec vous sur ce sujet. Vous nous avez d\u2019ailleurs parl\u00e9 d\u2019actions. Le niveau de productivit\u00e9 en Europe augmente deux fois moins vite qu\u2019aux USA, o\u00f9 la croissance moyenne des investissements est de 5,4% par an contre 1,7% pour les investissements europ\u00e9ens.\nCe qu\u2019attendent nos concitoyens, ce sont bien des changements concrets qui se traduisent en termes simples: ne plus craindre les d\u00e9localisations, ne plus avoir peur du ch\u00f4mage et voir augmenter le pouvoir d\u2019achat. Nous attendons donc avec impatience votre programme-cadre pour la comp\u00e9titivit\u00e9 et l\u2019innovation, avec des objectifs et des rendez-vous pr\u00e9cis.\nD\u00e9velopper la croissance et l\u2019emploi, c\u2019est s\u2019appuyer sur l\u2019innovation et la recherche, c\u2019est surtout r\u00e9concilier politique de l\u2019environnement et politique industrielle. Ces deux politiques ne sont pas contradictoires, au contraire, elles sont compl\u00e9mentaires. Les consid\u00e9rations environnementales ne sont pas des contraintes ou des entraves. Elles sont des atouts, une chance pour notre \u00e9conomie. L\u2019Europe doit donc jouer la carte de l\u2019\u00e9co-innovation et des technologies de pointe afin de pouvoir r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une demande de produits \u00e0 haute valeur ajout\u00e9e que nos concurrents ne peuvent satisfaire.\nGr\u00e2ce \u00e0 des normes environnementales \u00e9lev\u00e9es, l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne stimule l\u2019innovation et augmente les capacit\u00e9s comp\u00e9titives de son industrie. Je songe au d\u00e9veloppement des \u00e9nergies renouvelables, entre autres aux \u00e9nergies \u00e9olienne et solaire, aux biocarburants, aux transports propres, autant de secteurs qui offrent \u00e0 nos industries une v\u00e9ritable chance en termes d\u2019emploi et d\u2019exportations. Nous notons avec int\u00e9r\u00eat, Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident de la Commission, vos propositions dans ce domaine, notamment le r\u00e8glement sur les mesures \u00e0 prendre contre les pollutions de l\u2019air.\nUn d\u00e9veloppement \u00e9conomique viable, une croissance retrouv\u00e9e s\u2019appuient avant tout sur la sant\u00e9 de nos entreprises, mais aussi sur la sant\u00e9 des hommes et des femmes qui sont les acteurs de notre \u00e9conomie. Nous appr\u00e9cions le volet de votre programme qui concerne la sant\u00e9 et la politique des consommateurs. L\u2019Europe doit aussi anticiper les menaces \u00e9ventuelles de grands fl\u00e9aux, lutter contre les nouvelles formes d\u2019\u00e9pid\u00e9mie, les r\u00e9sistances aux antibiotiques. C\u2019est donc avec grand int\u00e9r\u00eat que nous attendons la proposition de directive visant \u00e0 mettre en place des mesures communautaires de lutte contre la grippe aviaire. Il nous faudra faire vite et bien.\nEn ce qui concerne l\u2019\u00e9volution d\u00e9mographique en Europe, le livre vert doit rapidement \u00eatre suivi de mesures concr\u00e8tes: apprentissage tout au long de la vie, p\u00e9rennit\u00e9 de nos syst\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9, recherche sur les maladies neurod\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9ratives. Concernant la politique de solidarit\u00e9, il est juste que les nouveaux entrants b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient de ces programmes, mais n\u2019oubliez pas que les fonds concern\u00e9s v\u00e9hiculent aussi l\u2019image de l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne \u00e0 travers tous les \u00c9tats membres. Il est donc indispensable que tous les pays puissent acc\u00e9der \u00e0 ces aides structurelles.\nNous demandons \u00e9galement plus d\u2019efficacit\u00e9 dans le suivi des d\u00e9cisions de justice entre \u00c9tats membres, bien qu\u2019\u00e0 ce sujet nous attendions encore les r\u00e9sultats de la cod\u00e9cision telle que pr\u00e9vue par la Constitution. Nous savons que tout cela doit contribuer \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer la mobilit\u00e9 des Europ\u00e9ens. Nous devons \u00e9galement am\u00e9liorer la mobilit\u00e9 de la jeunesse plus sp\u00e9cifiquement: faciliter les \u00e9changes universitaires, faire profiter de ces formidables exp\u00e9riences que sont les fili\u00e8res professionnelles.\nNous avons de l\u2019ambition, vous en avez aussi. Nous souhaitons d\u00e9velopper et am\u00e9liorer les conditions de travail pour aboutir \u00e0 la mise en place de mesures concr\u00e8tes, am\u00e9liorer l\u2019\u00e9quilibre entre vie familiale et vie professionnelle. C\u2019est ainsi que nous pourrons remplir l\u2019objectif que l\u2019Union doit poursuivre et tirer l\u2019ensemble de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 europ\u00e9enne vers le haut. Dans son r\u00f4le d\u2019initiative, la Commission europ\u00e9enne doit \u00eatre visionnaire.\nDans le domaine de la politique, nous insistons sur les relations euro-m\u00e9diterran\u00e9ennes. La politique euro-m\u00e9diterran\u00e9enne doit \u00eatre beaucoup plus forte. Elle doit \u00eatre prioritaire. De m\u00eame, nous devons nous pencher sur nos fronti\u00e8res, les fronti\u00e8res de l\u2019Europe.\nPour terminer, je souhaiterais, Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident de la Commission, vous dire que la volont\u00e9 politique doit se traduire par des perspectives financi\u00e8res qui doivent, elles, \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9es \u00e0 leur juste mesure. Les \u00c9tats membres ne peuvent demander plus \u00e0 l\u2019Europe en donnant moins.

Mrs\u00a0Grosset\u00eate, given the substance of your speech, I cordially invite you to join us, and we shall quickly secure majorities for socially responsible policies in the European Union. I saw the profound shock in the eyes of my fellow Member, Mr Poettering, and it was a real treat to observe his reaction.\nPresident Barroso, I am delighted that you have managed to be with us in spite of the present demands on your time. I want to make that very clear. We are all aware of the problems you experienced in London with your flight. Your presence here augurs well for cooperation between the Commission and the European Parliament. Let me emphasise that. But enough of these pleasantries, for I also have one or two remarks to make that I believe you will be less happy to hear.\nI do not wish to return to the issue of whether it was right or wrong for you to appear in an advert for the PSD in Portugal. That is in the past now. I would like to make a serious proposal, however, with regard to the negotiations on the framework agreement. We must make a decision. There is a provision in the framework agreement between Parliament and the Commission which clearly states that Commissioners are not forbidden to engage in political activities in their home countries, provided they discuss the activity beforehand with the President of the Commission, who either gives his consent to whatever is necessary for the performance of the activity or expresses his misgivings.\nThere is no rule, however, for the President, although his conduct should, of course, be exemplary. I personally have no problem whatsoever with the principle that the Commissioners, or you as President of the Commission, have a set of political views and can air those views in public. I am well aware of where your political affiliation lies. It goes without saying that you are not required to go around hypocritically pretending that your election to the presidency of the Commission has made you politically neutral. I believe it is only right that you should continue to uphold your views, but the same rule must apply to the President and the Commissioners alike, whether it authorises or forbids all of you to engage in national politics. Saying \u2018yes\u2019 to some and \u2018no\u2019 to others is unacceptable. This is why I suggest that we clarify this matter in the framework agreement.\nA second remark, Mr\u00a0President; in our most recent discussion of your work programme, I said on behalf of our group that we saw the glass as half full. I said this because we had seen encouraging signs that you were heeding the appeals which we Socialists had been making to you and your Commission.\nThen, a few days later, I found an interview with you in the Financial Times in which you took a completely different line from the one you had presented when you addressed this Parliament. \u2018Economy is in the front seat\u2019, you were now saying. No! Social coherence is in the front seat \u2013 at least for us Socialists, Mr\u00a0President \u2013 and we shall not release you from your obligations on this score. You presented a work programme with Socialist elements but then gave an interview in the Financial Times which went in the very opposite direction. Later, Mr\u00a0\u0160pidla presented a paper to which we Socialists can heartily subscribe, but this was followed by comments in the press by Mrs\u00a0H\u00fcbner which we find absolutely impossible to accept.\nYou made it to the Berlaymont building, Mr\u00a0President, but I have the impression that, whenever you arrive at the Schuman roundabout, you are no longer sure which exit to take. For this reason, let me suggest that you follow our Socialist proposals, because the problem with the European Union is this: if we do not make it clear to the public that this Union of ours offers them social security, and allow them to carrying on thinking that Brussels is out to destroy their social security, the risks we incur will outweigh the opportunities we create. Until we stop conveying that impression, citizens will continue to turn their backs on Europe.\nThis has to do with the fact that the neo-liberal approach is presented \u2013 perhaps not by you, Mr\u00a0Barroso, but by many of your Commissioners and, what is far worse, by a great many of your officials within the Commission as a fact of everyday life; all will be well with Europe, so the theory goes, when it is deregulated, made more flexible, and locked into a downward social spiral. As long as this is the main thrust of your Commission\u2019s policies, the climate will never change in favour of the EU. We Socialists have not been elected to support the sort of neo-liberal policies that are enshrined in the Bolkestein directive, but to guarantee both sides of the coin on which our discussions have long been focused. On the one hand, we need competition and flexibility, but this increase in competition and flexibility must serve to promote the achievement of the other goal, namely social stability.\nFor this reason, I ask you to stand by what you said in your strategic guidelines and what you presented to us, together with Mrs Wallstr\u00f6m and Mr\u00a0Verheugen, in the Lisbon strategy, which formulates these very principles: greater flexibility and more competition, certainly, but also an enduring commitment to the social structures that are Europe\u2019s greatest achievement. If you read our resolution, you will see that we are willing to engage in constructive cooperation with you, but only if you, along with your Commission, are willing to build a social Europe. Then we shall gladly give you our backing.\n(Applause)", "lang": "DE", "original": "Schulz (PSE), im Namen der PSE-Fraktion . \u2013 Frau Pr\u00e4sidentin, sehr geehrte Damen und Herren! Die Rede, die wir gerade geh\u00f6rt haben, war keine Rede der PPE, es war eine Rede der franz\u00f6sischen Gaullisten. Frau Grosset\u00eate, ich lade Sie herzlich ein, sich mit den Inhalten Ihrer Rede uns anzuschlie\u00dfen, dann werden wir schnell Mehrheiten f\u00fcr eine sozial verantwortliche Politik in der Europ\u00e4ischen Union bekommen.

Ich freue mich, dass Sie trotz der schwierigen terminlichen Situation, in der Sie sind, den Weg zu uns gefunden haben. Ich will das ausdr\u00fccklich sagen! Wir wissen alle, dass Sie in London noch Schwierigkeiten mit dem Flug hatten. Dass Sie hier sind, ist ein gutes Zeichen f\u00fcr die Zusammenarbeit zwischen der Kommission und dem Europ\u00e4ischen Parlament. Dies will ich hier ausdr\u00fccklich erw\u00e4hnen. Damit habe ich Ihnen aber auch schon genug Freude gemacht, denn ich muss die eine oder andere Bemerkung machen, von der ich glaube, dass sie Sie nicht so fr\u00f6hlich stimmen wird.\nIch will nicht mehr auf die Frage zur\u00fcckkommen, ob es richtig war, dass Sie in einem Werbespot f\u00fcr die PSD in Portugal aufgetreten sind. Das ist jetzt vorbei. Aber ich m\u00f6chte ernsthaft folgenden Vorschlag unterbreiten: Was die Verhandlungen zum Rahmenabkommen angeht, m\u00fcssen wir uns entscheiden. Es gibt eine Regelung im Rahmenabkommen zwischen Parlament und Kommission, die klar ist. Den Kommissaren ist es nicht untersagt, sich in ihren Heimatl\u00e4ndern politisch zu bet\u00e4tigen. Sie m\u00fcssen dies \u2013 so sieht dieses Rahmenabkommen vor \u2013 mit dem Pr\u00e4sidenten der Kommission besprechen. Und der Pr\u00e4sident der Kommission gibt im Rahmen der Notwendigkeiten sein Einverst\u00e4ndnis oder \u00e4u\u00dfert seine Skepsis.\nEs gibt aber keine Regel f\u00fcr den Pr\u00e4sidenten, wobei dieser nat\u00fcrlich eigentlich ein Vorbild sein m\u00fcsste. Ich pers\u00f6nlich habe \u00fcberhaupt kein Problem damit, dass Kommissarinnen oder Kommissare, oder Sie als Kommissionspr\u00e4sident, eine politische Linie haben und dies auch nach au\u00dfen klar machen. Ich wei\u00df ja eh, wo Sie politisch stehen. Sie brauchen ja nicht heuchlerisch rumzulaufen und so zu tun, als h\u00e4tten Sie sich ab Ihrer Wahl zum Kommissionspr\u00e4sident zum politischen Neutrum verwandelt. Also, stehen Sie zu Ihrer Meinung, ich finde das gut, dann aber alle, der Pr\u00e4sident wie die Kommissare, oder alle nicht. Aber mal ja und mal nein, das geht nicht. Deshalb schlage ich vor, dass wir diese Frage im Rahmenabkommen kl\u00e4ren.\nEine zweite Bemerkung, Herr Pr\u00e4sident! Ich hatte in der letzten Diskussion, die wir \u00fcber Ihr Arbeitsprogramm f\u00fchrten, im Namen unser Fraktion gesagt: Das Glas ist halb voll. Dies, weil wir positive Zeichen sehen hinsichtlich der Forderungen, die wir als Sozialdemokraten an Sie und Ihre Kommission stellen.\nDann schlage ich einige Tage sp\u00e4ter die Financial Times auf und sehe ein Interview mit Ihnen, das in eine absolut andere Richtung geht als die, die Sie in Ihrer Rede hier im Parlament vorgetragen hatten: Economy is in the front seat. Nein! Social coherence is in the front seat \u2013 jedenfalls f\u00fcr uns Sozialdemokraten, Herr Pr\u00e4sident, und aus dieser Forderung werden wir Sie nicht entlassen. Sie pr\u00e4sentieren Ihr Arbeitsprogramm mit sozialdemokratischen Elementen, geben aber dann in der Financial Times ein Interview, das genau in die entgegengesetzte Richtung geht. Sp\u00e4ter legt Herr Spidla ein Papier vor, mit dem wir Sozialdemokraten wunderbar leben k\u00f6nnen, doch dann bekommen wir wieder \u00c4u\u00dferungen von Frau H\u00fcbner in der Presse zu lesen, die wir absolut nicht akzeptieren k\u00f6nnen.\nSie sind zwar im Berlaymont angekommen, Herr Pr\u00e4sident, aber ich habe den Eindruck, immer wenn Sie auf dem Schuman-Kreisel sind, wissen Sie nicht mehr, welche Ausfahrt Sie nehmen sollen. Deshalb mache ich Ihnen einen Vorschlag: Fahren Sie in Richtung unserer sozialdemokratischen Vorschl\u00e4ge, denn das Problem der Europ\u00e4ischen Union liegt darin, dass, wenn wir den B\u00fcrgerinnen und B\u00fcrgern nicht klarmachen, dass diese Union ihnen soziale Sicherheit bietet, sondern es l\u00e4nger zulassen, dass die B\u00fcrger den Eindruck haben, das, was in Br\u00fcssel geschieht, zerst\u00f6re die soziale Sicherheit, dies uns mehr Risiken als Chancen bringt. Solange wir das zulassen, werden sich die B\u00fcrger von Europa abwenden.\nDies hat damit zu tun, dass der neoliberale Ansatz \u2013 vielleicht nicht bei Ihnen, Herr Barroso, aber bei vielen Ihrer Kommissare, und was noch viel schlimmer ist, bei ganz vielen Ihrer Beamten in der Kommission \u2013 als allt\u00e4gliche Selbstverst\u00e4ndlichkeit dargestellt wird; dass Europa nur dann gut ist, wenn es dereguliert, flexibilisiert wird und in sozialer Hinsicht immer nur nach unten geht. Solange dies in Ihrer Kommission die Hauptintonation ist, solange wird sich die Atmosph\u00e4re nicht zugunsten der EU wenden. Wir Sozialdemokraten sind nicht gew\u00e4hlt worden, um eine neoliberale Politik, wie sie die Bolkestein-Richtlinie vorsah, zu unterst\u00fctzen, sondern um die zwei Seiten der Medaille, \u00fcber die wir schon lange diskutieren, auch zu garantieren. Auf der einen Seite brauchen wir Wettbewerb und Flexibilit\u00e4t, aber diese Steigerung von Wettbewerb und Flexibilit\u00e4t muss der anderen Seite dienen, n\u00e4mlich der sozialen Stabilit\u00e4t.\nDeshalb bitte ich Sie, bleiben Sie bei dem, was Sie in Ihren strategischen Leitlinien vorgetragen haben, und bei dem, was Sie uns gemeinsam mit Margot Wallstr\u00f6m und G\u00fcnther Verheugen in der Lissabon-Strategie vorgestellt haben, wo n\u00e4mlich genau das formuliert ist. Flexibilisierung, mehr Wettbewerb: ja; aber immer unter Wahrung der sozialen Strukturen, die Europas Errungenschaft sind. Wenn Sie unsere Entschlie\u00dfung lesen, werden Sie sehen, dass wir zu einer sehr konstruktiven Zusammenarbeit mit Ihnen bereit sind, aber nur dann, wenn Sie auch Ihrerseits bereit sind, mit Ihrer Kommission das soziale Europa zu verwirklichen. Dann reichen wir Ihnen gerne die Hand.\n(Beifall)", "agenda_item": "Commission legislative and work programme (2005) (continuation of debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20050221-ITEM-013", "intervention_id": "1-081", "summary_english": "{\n  \"headline\": \"Schulz Criticizes Commission's Neo-Liberalism, Urges Commitment to Social Europe in 2005 Work Programme\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"Schulz addresses the direction of the Commission's 2005 legislative and work programme, raising concerns over inconsistencies between public statements and policy actions, the portrayal of neo-liberal policies, and the need for stronger social protections within the EU.

On behalf of my group, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I should like to refer to two possible areas of complicity in the light of current events. You mentioned the most relevant event yourself, Mr\u00a0Barroso, namely the forthcoming talks in Brussels with the President of the United States.\nI believe that, following Condoleezza Rice\u2019s charm offensive in Europe, it must and it will emerge in the coming days and weeks \u2013 and the Iran issue will be the acid test \u2013 whether we have only one common goal and continue to go our own separate ways, or whether we manage to develop multilateral measures and avert the danger of unilateralism, which we saw during the preventive war against Iraq.\nOn behalf of my group, may I warmly encourage you and strongly urge the Commission to make every effort in the forthcoming talks to persuade the US Administration to lend its active support to the negotiating strategy of the three EU representatives.\nLet me reiterate the common aims of both the American and the European negotiators and the EU Member States. Our aim is complete consensus. We must prevent the further proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in the wider Middle East. We must press on with the development of a political strategy for the wider Middle East on the basis of the European security strategy. We must succeed in enshrining a binding commitment by Iran to refrain from military use of the potential created by its nuclear programme, and we need unlimited access for the International Atomic Energy Agency to enable it to inspect all of Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities. These are the prerequisites for the creation of a ring of security around every country in the region, including Israel.\nI am convinced that the European negotiations are the right way forward and are far more likely to succeed if we can persuade President Bush not merely to wait in the wings, not to engage in verbal sabre-rattling and not to keep open the option of a preventive attack, but to put on the agenda an active review of the current economic sanctions against Iran, as well as discussing security guarantees for Iran.\nI believe we shall advance in this area if we also remain true to our principle of safeguarding human rights. I appeal specifically to the Commission not to shelve the dialogue on human rights for the duration of the negotiations, but to intensify it. I very much regret having to say this, but I have learned that the German Government, the selfsame Government which is actively supporting our negotiations on the EU side, has instituted deportation proceedings against a 26-year-old woman who obtained a divorce from her Iranian husband and converted to Christianity. Deportation to Iran in these circumstances \u2013 and we have opposed it in two previous resolutions \u2013 exposes a woman to the danger of stoning, persecution or even death.\nI believe that such a bipolar policy makes it difficult, but we must manage to rally a majority in Europe behind a coherent human rights policy. That will establish our credibility on the Iran issue. I have no wish to see Iran succeed in playing off the Europeans against the Americans, because we both have the same objectives. I must re-emphasise that point.\nLet me also refer at this juncture to another issue where my group is in agreement with the President of the United States, namely the continuation of the embargo against China. If we say that the criterion of respect for human rights is fundamental to our European foreign policy, we must acknowledge that the human rights situation in China remains appalling, and it was for this reason that the House adopted a resolution only a few weeks ago in which it rejected the initiative launched by President Chirac and Chancellor Schr\u00f6der. We expect this embargo to be maintained and reaffirm that economic interests must not take precedence over human rights.", "lang": "DE", "original": "Beer (Verts/ALE), im Namen der Verts/ALE-Fraktion . \u2013 Frau Pr\u00e4sidentin, Herr Pr\u00e4sident Barroso! Sie haben gerade eine positive Komplizenschaft zwischen Kommission und Parlament angeboten. F\u00fcr meine Fraktion, Die Gr\u00fcnen, m\u00f6chte ich aus aktuellem Anlass zwei solche M\u00f6glichkeiten der Komplizenschaft benennen. Sie haben den aktuellen Anlass selbst genannt: Es sind die bevorstehenden Gespr\u00e4che mit dem US-Pr\u00e4sidenten in Br\u00fcssel.\nIch denke, dass nach der Charme-Offensive von Condoleezza Rice in Europa sich in den n\u00e4chsten Tagen und Wochen zeigen wird und zeigen muss \u2013 und zwar in der Iran-Frage \u2013, ob wir nur ein gemeinsames Ziel haben und nach wie vor getrennte Wege gehen, oder ob wir es schaffen, multilaterale Schritte zu entwickeln, und die Gefahr eines Unilateralismus, wie wir ihn im Rahmen des Pr\u00e4ventivschlages gegen den Irak erlebt haben, ausschalten k\u00f6nnen.\nIch m\u00f6chte Sie im Namen meiner Fraktion ausdr\u00fccklich ermuntern und die Kommission eindringlich auffordern, alles M\u00f6gliche zu versuchen, um in den bevorstehenden Gespr\u00e4chen die US-Regierung dazu zu bewegen, die europ\u00e4ische Verhandlungsstrategie der drei EU-Vertreter aktiv zu unterst\u00fctzen.\nLassen Sie mich noch einmal die gemeinsamen Ziele sowohl der Amerikaner als auch der Europ\u00e4er und der europ\u00e4ischen Mitgliedsl\u00e4nder nennen. Unser Ziel ist vollkommener Konsens. Wir m\u00fcssen die weitere Verbreitung von Massenvernichtungswaffen im Nahen und Mittleren Osten verhindern. Wir m\u00fcssen die Entwicklung einer politischen Strategie f\u00fcr den gesamten Weiteren Nahen und Mittleren Osten auf der Grundlage der europ\u00e4ischen Sicherheitsstrategie vorantreiben. Wir m\u00fcssen den Verzicht von Iran auf eine milit\u00e4rische Nutzung des Atomprogramms verbindlich festschreiben k\u00f6nnen, und wir brauchen die unbegrenzte Zutrittsm\u00f6glichkeit der IAEO, um s\u00e4mtliche Anlagen von Iran zu inspizieren. Das sind die Voraussetzungen, um auch f\u00fcr Israel ein sicheres Umfeld zu schaffen.\nIch bin \u00fcberzeugt davon, dass der richtige Weg der europ\u00e4ischen Verhandlungen eine viel gr\u00f6\u00dfere Chance hat, positiv zu verlaufen, wenn wir den US-Pr\u00e4sidenten \u00fcberzeugen k\u00f6nnen, nicht nur stand by zu sitzen, nicht nur verbal mit dem S\u00e4bel zu rasseln, die Frage des Pr\u00e4ventivschlages nicht offen zu lassen, sondern eine aktive \u00dcberpr\u00fcfung der geltenden Wirtschaftssanktionen gegen\u00fcber Iran auf die Tagesordnung zu setzen und auch \u00fcber Sicherheitsgarantien f\u00fcr Iran zu reden.\nIch denke, dass wir in diesem Bereich weiterkommen, wenn wir auch unserem Grundsatz der Wahrung der Menschenrechte treu bleiben. Ich appelliere ausdr\u00fccklich an die Kommission, den Menschenrechtsdialog mit Iran nicht zur\u00fcckzustellen, solange die Verhandlungen laufen, sondern diesen zu intensivieren. Ich sage das mit gr\u00f6\u00dftem Bedauern, zumal ich feststellen musste, dass ausgerechnet die deutsche Regierung, die ja unsere Verhandlungen auf Seiten der EU aktiv unterst\u00fctzt, ein Abschiebeverfahren gegen eine 26j\u00e4hrige Frau in die Wege geleitet hat, die sich von ihrem iranischen Mann hat trennen lassen und die zum christlichen Glauben \u00fcbergetreten ist. Eine Abschiebung nach Iran in dieser Situation \u2013 und wir haben uns zweimal mit Entschlie\u00dfungen dagegen gewandt \u2013 bedeutet die Gefahr von Steinigung, von Verfolgung, sogar von T\u00f6tung.\nIch glaube, dass eine solche gespaltene Politik es schwierig macht, aber wir m\u00fcssen es schaffen, in Europa eine koh\u00e4rente Menschenrechtspolitik mehrheitsf\u00e4hig zu machen. Dann sind wir auch, was Iran betrifft, glaubw\u00fcrdig. Ich m\u00f6chte nicht, dass Iran erfolgreich versucht, die Europ\u00e4er gegen die Amerikaner auszuspielen, denn wir haben die gleichen Zielsetzungen. Dies will ich noch mal unterstreichen.\nEinen Punkt des Konsens meiner Fraktion mit dem US-Pr\u00e4sidenten m\u00f6chte ich hier auch zur Sprache bringen: Es ist die Frage der Aufrechterhaltung des Embargos gegen China. Wenn wir sagen, das Kriterium \u201eEinhaltung der Menschenrechte\u201c ist Grundlage unserer europ\u00e4ischen Au\u00dfenpolitik, dann m\u00fcssen wir zur Kenntnis nehmen, dass die Menschenrechtssituation in China nach wie vor fatal ist, und aus diesem Grund hat dieses Parlament vor wenigen Wochen eine Entschlie\u00dfung verabschiedet und den Vorsto\u00df der Kanzler Schr\u00f6der und Chirac zur\u00fcckgewiesen. Wir erwarten, dass dieses Embargo aufrecht bleibt und nicht Wirtschaftsinteressen zu Lasten der Menschenrechtslage in den Vordergrund ger\u00fcckt werden.", "agenda_item": "Commission legislative and work programme (2005) (continuation of debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20050221-ITEM-013", "intervention_id": "1-083", "summary_english": "{\n  \"headline\": \"Calls for Multilateralism and Human Rights Focus in EU Commission's 2005 Legislative Programme\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"The speaker raises key issues regarding the EU's approach to international relations in the Commission's 2005 work programme, particularly in the context of Iran's nuclear programme, relations with the United States, and the EU's embargo against China.

To make matters worse, I believe it is also using the wrong means to pursue that goal.\nThe operating profits of the large conglomerates in the European Union increased by 78% in 2004. The ratio of profits to GDP is at what is nearly its highest level in the last 25 years. Over the past 12\u00a0months, another substantial surplus has been registered in the balance of trade and the balance of payments.\nEven in the Federal Republic of Germany, where the large companies are constantly bleating about being shackled by an uncompetitive location, 46 of the 50 companies listed in the Dax index clocked up staggering increases in their profits over the first three quarters.\nAt the same time, unemployment is rising. There are more and more debates on the introduction of longer working hours in various different forms. Employees are expected to practise wage restraint, which effectively amounts to a drop in real incomes. Welfare benefits are being cut or recipients\u2019 contributions drastically increased, and schemes based on solidarity are increasingly being shunted towards dependence on private funding.\nThese actions are weakening demand instead of strengthening it. We regard this as a pernicious trend. Of course we need competition, but it must be compatible with the Gothenburg criteria, so as to minimise unemployment, maximise consumer protection and guarantee social security within a healthy environment, and so as to achieve social cohesion through solidarity and sustainable development.\nAccordingly, we must make the following pleas to the Commission: abandon your neo-liberal economic policies and scrap your directives on service provision in the single market as well as the Working Time Directive and present replacements in the form of directives on improved health and safety at work or on the harmonisation of welfare standards. Protect small and medium-sized enterprises by using the directives adopted by the last Parliament, such as the directive on software patents, as the basis for a new proposal. Together with the Council, amend the Stability Pact to make expenditure on education and training count as investment, thereby eliminating it from the calculation of the debt ratio. Strive for democratic and socially just world trade by trying to reform the WTO, and do not go to Hong Kong with the same ideas that the old Commission took to Canc\u00fan.\nDo not argue for more effective military options, but only for peaceful solutions. Campaign for better protection of the environment, and remember that there is certainly still work to be done here in the European Union in fields such as biodiversity, the avoidance and recycling of waste and the sustainable use of resources. Exert more influence in the struggle to protect the global climate, because not only the United States but also China, India and Brazil must be motivated to commit themselves more firmly to this effort.\nThis would be the right course for the European Union; it would promote sustainable development and create jobs.

Die Debatten um Verl\u00e4ngerung der Arbeitszeit, egal in welcher Form, nehmen zu. Von den Arbeitnehmern wird Lohnzur\u00fcckhaltung gefordert, was in Wirklichkeit ein Absinken des Realeinkommens darstellt.

This was outlined very clearly in a report in today's Financial Times on a study by the Centre for the Study of Financial Innovation, which stated clearly that most people involved in banking and financial services believe that we have far too much regulation and that we need to tackle it so that business can become more competitive.\nThe key priorities for the European Union at this time include: the completion of the Financial Services Action Plan so as to guarantee a greater level of competition amongst the financial institutions operating within the 25 Member States of the EU, which includes ensuring that retail banking services are available to all EU citizens in the 25 Member States; facilitating the merging of European banks and the updating of asset management legislation so as to guarantee that fund managers can operate asset funds on a cross-border basis; the introduction of new legislation to reduce the costs of clearing and settling trading security transactions; and the introduction of greater competition in the insurance sector.\nThe European Union must promote a greater level of dialogue with America to streamline the rules governing the operating of the accountancy industry. The European Union operates under a system known as IAS, which is the International Accountancy Standards system. Meanwhile, the American business community operates under the GAAP accountancy structure. This year, 8\u00a0000 companies will be listed on European stock exchanges, operating under the IAS system. It is simply wrong that America and Europe operate under two different accountancy models. A greater level of dialogue will have to take place to hammer out these issues.\nThe European Union must implement the new Services Directive. It must guarantee that the benefits of all technologies are available to communities in Europe, both urban and rural.\nMr Barroso, your recent statements on the Lisbon strategy and the economic way forward for Europe have been very positive, and I wish you well.

If that is what we want, we must offer citizens real substance, and explain the importance of that substance.\nIn our view, a social Europe should be the priority. In order to achieve a social Europe, however, we need jobs. For jobs we need growth, and for growth we need both investment and, first and foremost, education, training and lifelong learning, and \u2013 yes, Mr\u00a0Kirkhope \u2013 we need greater flexibility too. Anyone calling for flexibility, however, must know that flexibility and social security are not mutually exclusive; as the Nordic model has shown, the public is in fact willing to accept a greater degree of flexibility if a social safety net is in place and if there are also, for example, extensive opportunities for further training to enable people to cope with the implications of this flexibility, including its social implications.\nWe also need effective public services. Your statement, Mr\u00a0President, did not entirely satisfy me, because the question of services cannot be reduced to market economics. Our public services are part of our own identity; whether they be postal services or local transport, they are part of the European identity, which the people of Europe rightly want to see defended. This is therefore not a purely economic matter, but a profoundly emotive issue too.\nOne final point: what Vice-President Wallstr\u00f6m did very recently with regard to the rights of air passengers was a very positive step, in my opinion. The fact is that we must go public and tell people what we have achieved in this Parliament, including our responses to proposals from the Commission. We must tell them that we are here for them, which is why I ask you not to approach legislative measures from an exclusively technical perspective as a means of creating better regulations, but always to think of the people for whom we make these laws and to whom we wish to communicate them.

We also have something to show tomorrow, when you see President Bush. It has become clear to all of us \u2013 and this must be reflected in our policies \u2013 that only joint action makes us a significant factor, and this action pays off, because I can find no other explanation for Condoleezza Rice\u2019s comment that the European Constitution should be adopted.

Allow me also to express my thanks to you, President Barroso, for your own particular role in enabling the President of this House to take part in tomorrow\u2019s meeting.\nI should like to refer to another related point, namely our neighbourhood policy. I do not believe we have made enough progress in this direction, and President Yushchenko will be here in Parliament on Wednesday so that we can seek a new way to address the formidable challenge of cementing democracy in Eastern Europe, so that closer links can be forged between Eastern Europe and the European Union. This implies an urgent need for something more than the neighbourhood policy, because the alternative is increased pressure to narrow the focus of discussions prematurely onto full membership, which we could not deliver immediately, because it would overstretch the integrative capacity of the European Union.\nWe must offer a vision to the people of these countries, and so it is certainly worth considering whether there should perhaps be another option besides full membership, an option that does not close the door on full membership but holds out that prospect as a long-term goal. At the same time, such an option can bring immediate gains, as happened in the past with the European Economic Area, from which Austria, Finland and Sweden entered the European Union.\nI ask the Commission to give this serious thought, because I fear that we shall otherwise become embroiled very soon in a difficult situation.

Nonetheless, I would ask you to devote your energies to what is essential. Europe must defend its social and environmental models. We all agree that Europe must carry out reforms and be more flexible in certain areas. You will not, however, win the support of Europeans by voting in favour of what the right is preparing to vote in favour of tomorrow when I present my report, that is to say less tax for the rich and more labour for the workers. That will not work.\nIn its 2005 annual report, the Economic Policy Committee said that Europe needs a macroeconomic framework supportive of stability and growth and that such a framework is indispensable, but that governments will reap the full benefits of structural reforms in terms of growth and employment only in an appropriate macroeconomic environment.

There is absolutely no doubt that all the pillars are, in principle, equally important components of the strategy. On the other hand, it is a truism that proper social and environmental policies cannot be pursued without a functioning economy. The economy is, as it were, the key to the realisation of all our other good political intentions. Priorities must therefore be set accordingly, although the pillar structure must not be forgotten. I should perhaps mention in passing that there is no better social policy than the creation of jobs. That may be another truism, but it still needs to be said.\nAnother gentle reminder might be in order, because the President of the Commission is constantly being taken to task over this matter. Both of the competent Vice-Presidents of the European Commission \u2013 the one who signed the paper in Lisbon and the one who signed the programme we are discussing today \u2013 are Socialists. It is perhaps appropriate to reiterate that in passing. This should mean that the dossier is in the best hands within the Commission, and I fail to see the point of forever dredging up this discussion on alleged differences that do not even exist.\nI also have a particular appeal to make in this matter, which is that the Commission must attach high priority in the framework of this legislative programme, as in other areas, to the implementation of its interinstitutional agreement with the Council and Parliament. This is vitally important. Among the reasons why things have not worked as well as they should in the past have been the lack of impact assessments of legislative proposals and the inadequate way in which the consultation of stakeholders has been conducted.\nI urge the President and Vice-President of the Commission, particularly in the course of their work over the coming months, to ensure that the interinstitutional agreement is consistently implemented in this context. In many areas, this will be the key to the success to which they and all of us aspire.\n(Applause)", "lang": "DE", "original": "Lehne (PPE-DE). \u2013 Frau Pr\u00e4sidentin, meine sehr verehrten Damen und Herren Kollegen!

Es gibt gar keinen Zweifel, dass all diese Pfeiler vom Grundsatz her gleichberechtigt Bestandteil dieser Strategie sind. Aber auf der anderen Seite ist es eine Binsenweisheit, dass ohne eine funktionierende Wirtschaft auch keine vern\u00fcnftige Sozialpolitik und keine vern\u00fcnftige Umweltpolitik betrieben werden kann. Dies ist sozusagen die Voraussetzung daf\u00fcr, dass man die anderen Wohltaten auch tats\u00e4chlich in der Politik umsetzen kann. Darum muss man die Priorit\u00e4ten auch in der richtigen Reihenfolge setzen, ohne dabei die S\u00e4ulen zu vergessen. Vielleicht noch am Rande bemerkt: Eine bessere Sozialpolitik als das Schaffen von Arbeitspl\u00e4tzen gibt es nicht. Ich denke, dies ist auch eine Binsenwahrheit, die man an dieser Stelle einfach einmal aussprechen sollte.\nVielleicht noch ein anderer dezenter Hinweis, weil ja in diesem Zusammenhang immer wieder auf den Kommissionspr\u00e4sidenten geschimpft wird. Die beiden verantwortlichen Vizepr\u00e4sidenten der Europ\u00e4ischen Kommission, die sowohl das Papier in Lissabon als auch das Programm, \u00fcber das wir heute hier beraten, mit unterzeichnet haben, sind Sozialisten. Vielleicht ist ein solcher Hinweis am Rande auch noch einmal angebracht. Von daher sollte das in der Kommission eigentlich in besten H\u00e4nden sein, und ich verstehe gar nicht, was diese immer wieder hochgezogene Diskussion \u00fcber angebliche Unterschiede, die es gar nicht gibt, eigentlich ausmacht.\nIch habe noch ein besonderes Anliegen in diesem Zusammenhang, und das ist, dass die Kommission auch im Rahmen dieses Gesetzgebungsprogramms besondere Priorit\u00e4t auf die Umsetzung der interinstitutionellen Vereinbarung mit Rat und Parlament legen muss. Dies ist von entscheidender Bedeutung! Einer der Gr\u00fcnde, warum die Dinge in der Vergangenheit nicht so funktioniert haben, wie sie funktionieren sollten, ist der Mangel an impact assessment, an Gesetzesfolgenabsch\u00e4tzung, gewesen, und die unzureichende Art und Weise, in der die Konsultation von stake holders durchgef\u00fchrt worden ist.\nIch bitte Sie, Herr Kommissionspr\u00e4sident, und Sie, Frau Kommissionsvizepr\u00e4sidentin, insbesondere auch in Ihrer Arbeit in den n\u00e4chsten Monaten darauf zu achten, dass die interinstitutionelle Vereinbarung diesbez\u00fcglich konsequent umgesetzt wird.

Both decisions emphasise the fact that the highest priorities for the EU, in the current circumstances, are reinvigorating economic growth and creating jobs.\nFrankly, I do not understand the argument over which comes first, economic growth or jobs. For me it is simple. Jobs are created in companies. Well, companies only grow and develop when there is a climate of confidence and a widespread desire to create an investment-friendly atmosphere.\nThis approach to life, this culture, will become a reality if the capacity is there to carry out the right economic policies. The greater the commitment among the Member States to implement the necessary reforms, the more quickly such a culture can be introduced. That is the only way in which we can maintain, and indeed develop, the European social model. Economic dynamism must not be seen as the enemy of social protection; it is, in fact, its staunchest ally.\nI have a different concern, however, which relates to the definition of priorities and the clear allocation of responsibilities. It was precisely because of the absence of these elements that reform of the Lisbon Strategy was needed. It is now the duty of the Member States to display the reforming spirit proposed by the Commission through practical political action.\nThere is a pressing need to carry out reforms, which, for the most part, are not popular with the public, but which Europe needs. These reforms will only succeed if they are explained, exhaustively if necessary. That is the only way in which they will be understood and accepted.\nI shall finish by saying that, to my mind, it is worthwhile looking into the benefits of escaping from the office environment and going out onto the street, and, as Members of the European Parliament, we should be the first to do this.", "lang": "PT", "original": "Silva Peneda (PPE-DE). \u2013 Nas \u00faltimas semanas, a Comiss\u00e3o Europeia tomou decis\u00f5es sobre dois temas marcantes: as orienta\u00e7\u00f5es estrat\u00e9gicas para o seu mandato e a reforma da Estrat\u00e9gia de Lisboa.

Europe today has grown to consist of 25 Member States, and I am one of those Members who come from one of the countries most recently added to it by enlargement. Europe is what it rightly should be; a Europe with a significant voice in global decision-making processes, and we must maintain this role by continuing to reinforce the foundations once laid by Schuman, De Gasperi and Monnet, based on principles that have enabled the European Union to come as far as it has today. The work that the European Union performs must constantly reflect the principles of subsidiarity and solidarity.\nIt is vitally important that economic growth be equally spread around all European regions. Europe is obliged to help those who for some reason have lagged behind to catch up and expand their economies. A strong economy can be created by closer cooperation between the Member States, and this is where I would like to congratulate the Commission on the implementation of a new economic strategy that aims to create over six million jobs. The Lisbon Strategy must be an absolute priority for all of us who work in the European institutions.\nWe must be able to translate this strategy into work and prosperity, a goal that can be achieved only if we manage to eliminate excess bureaucracy and create a strong business environment. We in this House must encourage initiatives that will create work across our continent. Europe\u2019s citizens expect us to improve Europe\u2019s standard of living, and so we must do our best.

(FR) Mr President, I will try to reply to some specific questions and then I would like to deal with a more general issue of policy, which I believe to be important in terms of our future work.\nWith regard to the specific issues, first of all, Mr\u00a0Duff, you told me that you had not properly understood, or not appreciated, a comment apparently attributed to me concerning na\u00efve federalism. I would very much like to clarify what I said, because it may not have been clear in the context. When I criticise na\u00efve federalism, it is not in fact federalism itself that I am criticising; quite the opposite. I have great respect for all the federalists, all the men and women who founded our great European project. I still believe, moreover, that the federal method is essential to this Europe of ours. Furthermore, the community method, or at least the method we generally describe as such, is a kind of federal method. So, in reality, I criticised na\u00efve federalism as contrasted with what I might consider to be a more sophisticated and more intelligent form of federalism, that is to say, an approach that does not seek to build our European Union \u2013 an increasingly close union between all Europeans, at the expense of the legitimacy of the democratic states. Our countries are, in fact, democratic states with democratic governments and democratic parliaments. I have had the honour of working in Geneva with a great federalist, Denis de Rougemont, who sometimes blamed the state for all evils, as if the state were not also a democratic institution. I am in favour of an increasingly strong Union, but that strengthening should not jeopardise the legitimacy of the democratic states. I very much wish to offer that clarification because I have heard criticisms of my comment, which gave a distorted view of my thoughts and feelings on the subject of Europe.\nThe second issue relates to security and justice. We have talked a lot about the economy, but we must not forget that we have a programme \u2013 and a very ambitious one at that \u2013 in the field of security and justice \u2013 a programme that will be implemented by Vice-President Frattini. That, specifically, was the subject of one of the questions raised. Security, justice and the protection of fundamental rights will be one of the Commission's priorities. We need to offer a practical response to people\u2019s demands in terms of security. That is why, in 2005, we are, in particular, going to present Parliament with the action plan aimed at implementing the strategy adopted in The Hague, in the form of proposals concerning the protection of the victims of organised crime, women and children in particular. I would draw your attention to the fact that this is a new dimension to the action described in our programme: placing more emphasis on the protection of children. We believe \u2013 and I also very much want to stress this \u2013 that this is a field in which it is possible to strengthen action at European level. Proposals can thus be presented with a view to strengthening mutual recognition and trust between the judicial authorities, and a proposal concerning a European strategy in relation to legal immigration and to the fight against people traffickers can be drawn up. Security, justice and the protection of human rights are a genuine priority, and I would like you to know that the Commission is going to do everything possible to respond to those demands.\nCertain Members, including Mr\u00a0Karas, Mr\u00a0Kirkhope, and Mr\u00a0Lehne, and also Mr\u00a0Goebbels to a certain degree, have raised the issue of how to focus legislation and of whether it should be strengthened or restricted. I am delighted, moreover, that the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council are fully aware of this concern. When I talk about \u2018better legislation\u2019, I do not always mean that we need less legislation. In certain cases, precisely because we are a Union, we need a degree of harmonisation or more legislation, sometimes in order to harmonise or simplify the existing legislation. I would, however, like to stress that we do share this concern about the quality of legislation, and we have introduced it into our programme. Throughout all of the action we take, we shall, therefore, be weighing up the factors of cost, proportionality and subsidiarity that we shall be using for the purposes of impact assessment.\nThis is why \u2013 and I say this partly in response to Mr\u00a0Goebbels \u2013 we have of course had to draw up a list of our main objectives. This is an implementation programme for this year. You would no doubt criticise us if I only presented four or five priorities. The political line is one dimension and, in this regard, we are talking about very clear and well-focussed priorities, defined when we presented the strategic objectives. The specific, legislative and implementation programme is another dimension, and one of which you should be aware so that you can monitor our activities, the Commission being answerable to this Parliament.\nWith regard to another specific question, namely climate change, I would like very much to say to Mrs Beer, who I am sure will put this question to President Bush tomorrow, that one of the subjects on our agenda is the possibility of cooperation with the Americans, partly in a post-Kyoto spirit. That is a sensitive subject. We are aware of the positions taken by the American administration to date, but I believe we should embark upon a dialogue on this issue with the United States of America. I shall probably have the opportunity to raise this issue with the President of the United States.\nWith regard, now, to the issue of the Directive on Services, I would very much like to say, in response specifically to Mr\u00a0Swoboda, that I agree with your concerns about services of general interest. I have already said this on many occasions: services of general interest, or certain public services, are part of what might be called the tradition, or organisational culture, of certain states. We are therefore seeking specifically to ensure that these concerns are taken into account, since we believe them to be legitimate.\nThat is why my Commission has taken the initiative to review certain aspects of the Directive on Services, and I was expecting a word of congratulation from yourselves. It is exactly the opposite that I hear from you when you describe this Commission as neoliberal even though it was not this Commission that presented the directive in question. In fact, we are seeking a balance while maintaining the objective, which is to create a genuine internal market in services, since that is essential to the creation of jobs in Europe. This is an objective we cannot abandon and on which, furthermore, there is consensus until 2010, but it must be pursued in a balanced manner. That is the fundamental political question I would like to put to our friends in the Socialist Party in the European Parliament, and in particular to Mr\u00a0Schultz, who raised this question.\nYou must choose: either you want to oppose the Commission or you want to work with it. I have already said that the Commission wants to work in a spirit of cooperation and constructive rapport with Parliament and, in particular, with all those Members who truly want to move Europe forward. This is no neoliberal proposal on our part.\nThe proposals I have put forward in this House are the result of a consensus. The Commission includes Christian Democrats, Socialists and Liberals. The Lisbon Agenda was presented to the Commission by myself and Vice-President Verheugen, who is a member of your political grouping. The programme I have just presented today has been presented by myself and Vice-President Wallstr\u00f6m, who is also a member of your political grouping.\nWe do not want to engage in dogmatism; we want to unite those Europeans who want reforms for Europe, but we do not want to abandon the reforms. If it has been possible for the Commission to take all these decisions unanimously, although there may have been expressed differences; if Christian Democrats, Socialists, Liberals and Independents have reached a consensus, why might we not also achieve that here in the European Parliament and unite around an ambitious programme of reform for this Europe of ours, which takes account of social and environmental concerns? Do not present a caricature of our Commission. That is not fair.\n(Applause)\nIf you look at the list of our objectives, you will find that it contains a series of specific proposals in the social and environmental fields. We are well aware that, today, it is impossible to create growth without an environmental dimension. On the contrary, we believe that the environment contributes to growth and increased competitiveness in Europe. We agree on this point, so please do not see obstacles where there are, in fact, none. What we want is to make it clear that the status quo is no longer an option today, that Europe has serious competitiveness problems when compared to other regions of the world and that we intend to put this right by adapting and renewing our social model. That is why the Commission has a President who wants reform, but also Socialist, Liberal, Christian Democrat and Independent members who all also want this reform to be carried out in a spirit of balance and proportion.\nI would therefore like to ask the PSE Group not to set itself up in opposition to the Commission: on the contrary, I would ask it to cooperate, though not in an uncritical way, with us, just as all the other groups do. Mrs Grosset\u00eate, who is a member of the largest political grouping in the European Parliament, has also expressed to us certain demands and requirements, and I thank her for that.\nI would now like to draw your attention, as fellow Europeans, to the fact that this is not just any moment in the history of Europe. Yesterday, we learned the result of the referendum in Spain, and we are delighted about this, but we shall also have a referendum in France. We shall have a referendum in the United Kingdom; I talked about it today with Prime Minister Blair in London. What do you believe Europeans expect now? They want the institutions to work together; they do not have a very good understanding of the fine details of the debate or of the policies of the political groups. They want to know whether the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council are working along the same lines and whether or not they are genuinely concerned about their problems.\nI believe it would be highly inappropriate, at a time like this when very important referendums are taking place, for people to look at Europe and see, on the one hand, the Commission and, on the other, a number of large groups such as your great European Socialist grouping, and thus to be presented with an image of division. I have already addressed this very sincere appeal to some of you personally and I would like to repeat it. We should not abandon our ideas, of course, since we are all very attached to them, but it is possible to look beyond these ideas and reach a dynamic consensus in favour of the reforms Europe needs. I believe that this is genuinely possible.\n(Applause)\nThe last issue relates to the criticism you expressed, Mr\u00a0Schultz, of the statement I made about my country. As, moreover, you acknowledged, I did not, where this matter was concerned, fail to honour any obligation, because the Commission's code of conduct clearly allows Commissioners to be active members of political parties and unions. There was therefore no failure to honour obligations. All I did was express my solidarity with the party of which I was President for several years. What would have been a real political event in my country is if I had kept quiet! I would therefore thank you for not putting the question in the form of an attack against me personally for the position I took, because it was perfectly permissible for me to take that position.\nYou raised the possibility of the code of conduct\u2019s being revised in terms of the interinstitutional agreement. I would very much like to say that I am completely opposed to this idea, since our code of conduct stipulates that the members of the Commission may participate in an election campaign if they request authorisation to do so from the President of the Commission. The question you raised is therefore about what happens in the case of the President of the Commission. I must state that if the President of the Commission has the power to decide whether or not Commissioners can participate, then he also has that power in relation to himself. This is clearly laid down in the Treaty, Article 217 of which states, and I shall read it in English:\nThe members of the Commission shall carry out duties devolved upon them by the President under his authority.\n(FR) The Treaty therefore clearly establishes the principle of the President's political leadership of the College and the principle of the President's authority. So to accept, by means of an interinstitutional agreement, a reduction in the authority of the President would be contrary to the Treaty as it stands, and to weaken the President of the Commission's authority would mean weakening the authority of the Commission itself.\nWe need a strong Commission. That is why I believe that your proposal is not a good one. I would draw the attention of all the political families to the fact that we, the European Parliament and the Commission, must strengthen each other on a mutual basis. We are the European institutions par excellence . We can do extraordinary things together, and we must therefore enhance each other\u2019s status. Personally, I try to enhance the status of the European Parliament in all my public statements, and not just in my statements. I would expect you to do the same, since we have great challenges to face together, and together we can win the day. However, we cannot do so by reducing the importance of the Commission and by asking the Commissioners to be civil servants. Instead, we must ask them to assume their political responsibilities, to exercise their citizenship and to express their preferences, always while working in a European spirit of course. As a citizen, I have the right to express my point of view about my own country. I have the right, like all European citizens, to vote in accordance with my opinions.\nAs President of the Commission, I will not discriminate. In fact, at your request, I received the leader of the opposition, who will become the Prime Minister of my country. I received him a few days before the beginning of the election campaign, because, as President of the Commission, I do not use my post to oppose any particular government and I do not distinguish between governments of the left and of the right. In fact, I believe that the Commission should represent the general European interest.\nHaving said that, the members of the Commission are political men and women. Perhaps some Members of this House do not like that. As citizens, we have rights, however. We have the right to express ourselves, and that is a fundamental right. That is why I do not accept your criticism in this regard. I would like to point out that we all need strong European institutions. This institution \u2013 the Commission \u2013 must be strong and must work with a strong Parliament, firmly committed to change and reforms and with the sense of balance that is at the heart of our Europe.\n(Applause)", "lang": "EN", "original": "Barroso, President of the Commission.

However, we cannot do so by reducing the importance of the Commission and by asking the Commissioners to be civil servants. Instead, we must ask them to assume their political responsibilities, to exercise their citizenship and to express their preferences, always while working in a European spirit of course. As a citizen, I have the right to express my point of view about my own country. I have the right, like all European citizens, to vote in accordance with my opinions.\nAs President of the Commission, I will not discriminate. In fact, at your request, I received the leader of the opposition, who will become the Prime Minister of my country. I received him a few days before the beginning of the election campaign, because, as President of the Commission, I do not use my post to oppose any particular government and I do not distinguish between governments of the left and of the right. In fact, I believe that the Commission should represent the general European interest.\nHaving said that, the members of the Commission are political men and women. Perhaps some Members of this House do not like that. As citizens, we have rights, however. We have the right to express ourselves, and that is a fundamental right. That is why I do not accept your criticism in this regard. I would like to point out that we all need strong European institutions. This institution \u2013 the Commission \u2013 must be strong and must work with a strong Parliament, firmly committed to change and reforms and with the sense of balance that is at the heart of our Europe.\n(Applause)", "agenda_item": "Commission legislative and work programme (2005) (continuation of debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20050221-ITEM-013", "intervention_id": "1-103", "summary_english": "{\n  \"headline\": \"Barroso Urges Consensus and Balanced Reform in Implementing the 2005 EU Legislative Programme\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"Key issues raised by Barroso include misunderstandings over the concept of federalism in the EU, the priority of security, justice, and fundamental rights, the approach to EU legislation (quality versus quantity), climate change cooperation, concerns about the Directive on Services and services of general interest, the importance of institutional unity during referendums, and questions regarding the political roles and conduct of Commissioners.\",\n  \"positionSum\": \"Barroso clarifies his support for a sophisticated, balanced federalism that does not undermine national democracy.

The main axes of contention centered on how to balance economic growth, social protection, environmental sustainability, effective governance, and democratic legitimacy, with numerous references to the Lisbon Strategy, the new European Constitution, and critical legislative acts like the Stability and Growth Pact, REACH, and the Directive on Services.\n\n---\n\n**B. Key Issues and Positions by Speaker**\n\n#### *Commission and EPP (PPE-DE) Perspectives*\n\n- **Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso (Commission President):**  \n  Barroso outlined a comprehensive and pragmatic programme based on \u201cthree pillars: prosperity, solidarity and security\u201d [Barroso, 2005-02-23]. He advocated for \u201cbetter regulation,\u201d balancing competitiveness with social cohesion, and modernizing social policy. Strategic legislative actions included the revised Lisbon Strategy, Stability and Growth Pact, REACH, and new initiatives on sustainable development and neighbourhood policies. He emphasized the need for \u201cadequate funding,\u201d the central role of cohesion policy, and a renewed social agenda.\n  \n- **Fran\u00e7oise Grosset\u00eate (PPE-DE):**  \n  Grosset\u00eate expressed strong support for Barroso\u2019s \u201cambitious\u201d and \u201cpractical\u201d approach, especially growth, employment, innovation, and a strong Euro-Mediterranean policy. She highlighted the potential of eco-innovation and the need for accessible structural aid: \u201cEnvironmental considerations are not constraints or obstacles. They are assets and present an opportunity for our economy\u201d [Grosset\u00eate, 2005-02-23].\n\n- **Timothy Kirkhope (PPE-DE):**  \n  Kirkhope prioritized economic reform, regulatory reduction, and labour market flexibility, criticizing \u201cthe old social model\u201d for driving \u201ceconomic decline and unemployment\u201d [Kirkhope, 2005-02-23]. Completing the single market and conducting \u201cfull impact assessments\u201d for new legislation were major recommendations.\n\n- **Salvador Garriga Polledo (PPE-DE), Silva Peneda (PPE-DE), Malcolm Harbour (PPE-DE), and others:**  \n  These speakers echoed support for deregulation, the Lisbon strategy, and economic dynamism, stressing the \u201cpressing need to carry out reforms, which, for the most part, are not popular with the public, but which Europe needs\u201d [Silva Peneda, 2005-02-23]. The need for clarity, subsidiarity, unity, and public communication were recurrent themes.\n\n- **Klaus-Heiner Lehne (PPE-DE):**  \n  Lehne highlighted the foundational role of a functioning economy, stating, \u201cthere is no better social policy than the creation of jobs\u201d [Lehne, 2005-02-23], and underlined the importance of implementing interinstitutional agreements (e.g., impact assessments).\n\n- **Other EPP contributors** (Inc. Karas, Casa, Brok, Zaleski, Brejc)  \n  Stressed need for unity, clarity, subsidiarity, and administrative reform, while supporting jobs, growth, and funding for pan-European events (e.g., youth meeting with the Pope).\n\n#### *Socialist Group (PSE) and Allied Views*\n\n- **Martin Schulz (PSE):**  \n  Schulz voiced skepticism about the Commission\u2019s \u201cneo-liberal\u201d tilt, warning: \u201cIf we do not make it clear to the public that this Union of ours offers them social security\u2026 the risks we incur will outweigh the opportunities we create\u201d [Schulz, 2005-02-23]. He insisted on a \u201csocial Europe\u201d with real commitments to cohesion and security, and equal political rules for Commissioners.\n\n- **Hannes Swoboda (PSE):**  \n  Swoboda championed public services and social investment, stating, \u201ca social Europe should be the priority,\u201d and emphasizing the Nordic model where \u201cthe public is in fact willing to accept a greater degree of flexibility if a social safety net is in place\u201d [Swoboda, 2005-02-23].\n\n- **Robert Goebbels (PSE):**  \n  Goebbels advised narrowing the focus: \u201cEurope must defend its social and environmental models. We have stability, Mr Barroso; what we now need is growth\u201d [Goebbels, 2005-02-23].\n\n- **Karin Roth and Genowefa Grabowska (PSE):**\n  Advocated balanced prioritization\u2014warning against undermining social and environmental standards for growth, and demanding vigilant enforcement of non-discrimination, especially towards new Member States.\n\n- **Marie-Arlette Carlotti and Adeline Hazan (PSE), Martine Roure (PSE):**\n  Urged that security, judicial cooperation, and rights must be delivered \u201cwithout weakening civil liberties,\u201d and called for \u201cfairer asylum and immigration policies\u201d [Roure, 2005-02-23].\n\n#### *Liberal (ALDE), Green (Verts/ALE), Left (GUE/NGL), and Other Voices*\n\n- **Andrew Duff (ALDE):**  \n  Called for \u201csharper focus\u201d and completion of the single market, especially financial services, critiquing the idea that \u201cthere can be social progress without economic growth and structural reform\u201d [Duff, 2005-02-23]. Emphasized legacy issues and regulatory quality.\n\n- **Barbara Lochbihler (Verts/ALE):**  \n  Focused on human rights and multilateralism, arguing: \u201cWe expect this embargo to be maintained and reaffirm that economic interests must not take precedence over human rights\u201d [Lochbihler/Beer, 2005-02-23]. Called for an active EU role in international diplomacy, notably on Iran and China.\n\n- **Helmut Markov (GUE/NGL):**  \n  Criticized neo-liberal economic policies, advocating \u201cabandon[ing] your neo-liberal economic policies and scrap[ping] your directives on service provision\u2026 and present[ing] replacements in the form of directives on improved health and safety\u201d [Markov, 2005-02-23].\n\n- **Gerard Batten (IND/DEM):**  \n  Challenged the democratic legitimacy of the Commission\u2019s agenda: \u201cThe European Commission is the unelected government of the EU\u2026 Soon\u2026 the whole EU project \u2013 and the sooner the better\u201d [Batten, 2005-02-23].\n\n- **James Ryan (UEN):**  \n  Argued for \u201cless regulation in Europe, not more,\u201d and stronger financial market integration, aligning with Barroso\u2019s vision for the Lisbon Strategy.\n\n---\n\n**C.

Conclusion**\n\nThe 2005 Commission legislative and work programme debate showcased an EU caught between \u201cold\u201d and \u201cnew\u201d models: growth versus social cohesion, deregulation versus protection, and vision versus pragmatism. Barroso committed to delivering a \u201cpolitical roadmap based on three pillars: prosperity, solidarity and security\u201d and called for unity, better legislation, and partnership with Parliament [Barroso, 2005-02-23]. The Parliament\u2019s input highlighted both support for ambitious reforms and deep concern about the social impact of liberal economic orientation. Successful implementation will require not just legislative action but sustained engagement with citizens and transparent, accountable governance.", "src_model": "gpt", "model_type": "gpt", "model_name": "gpt-4.1", "structured": true, "incremental": false, "hierarchical": false, "grouped": false, "shuffle": false, "prompt": false, "lang": "english"}
