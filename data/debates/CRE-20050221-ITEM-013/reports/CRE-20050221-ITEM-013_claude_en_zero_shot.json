      "english": "Barroso, President of the Commission . (PT) Mr President, eminent Members of the European Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, before I address you on the Commission’s legislative and work programme for 2005, I should like briefly to express my satisfaction with the results of yesterday’s referendum on the European Constitution in Spain and I shall try to do this in Spanish.\n(ES) The Spanish people have said yes to the European Constitution, a clear and resounding yes.\n(Applause)\nI would like to express to you the European Commission’s satisfaction with this result. Spain has said yes to a Europe united in its diversity. I would like to thank everybody who has participated in the referendum process with such commitment, in particular all the Members of this Parliament who have contributed with their voices and opinions to achieving this significant result. In this regard, I called the President of the Spanish Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, yesterday to congratulate him and thank him for the great commitment demonstrated by his government during the referendum campaign.\nThis ‘yes’, expressed clearly and unreservedly, opens the way for the other European citizens who will also be called upon to express their opinions on the European Constitution over the coming months.\nThis has been a very important step in the process of ratifying the European Constitution, which the Commission believes to be the only instrument which will allow us Europeans to consolidate our ideas of peace, prosperity, solidarity and security in Europe.\nMr President, one month ago I presented the Commission's proposed strategic objectives, designed to guide European action until the end of the decade. This is a political roadmap based on three pillars: prosperity, solidarity and security. Being mutually reinforcing, they address the concrete and challenging concerns of European citizens. I also presented the first delivery of the strategic objectives: the legislative work programme for this year. Let me remind you of some of its most important elements.\nFirst of all, the programme is more focused in political terms. The proposed initiatives are structured around the three strategic objectives and their external dimension, and represent a first concrete translation of the balanced approach pursued by the Commission. This applies to new initiatives as well as areas where we propose to reinforce an existing action.\nSecond, the Commission is fully committed to delivering its work programme. For this purpose, the Commission intends to adopt a list of just over 100 priority initiatives by the end of the year.\nFinally, we do not only want to deliver on time – we also want to deliver in a better way. We want to be serious about the principles of better regulation. This means ensuring quality of legislation; respect for the principles of proportionality, subsidiarity and added value; and widespread use of impact assessments.\nIn addition to this work programme, I announced that the Commission will regularly inform the Parliament about its planning agenda for legislative proposals in preparation. I am happy to be able to say that this information channel is now operational.\nIn the meantime, the Commission has gone further in implementing its proposals. On 2 February, I presented to you our proposals for a mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy. By focusing on growth and jobs, it aims to create the conditions for proper living standards, social justice for all and environmental sustainability. On 6 January and 2 February we had an initial exchange of views.\nI was pleased to hear that, broadly speaking, the Commission's proposals met many of the expectations and concerns of Members of this House. I welcome the detailed motions for resolutions tabled today by the political groups on the work programme. When we talk about partnership, dialogue and consultation, we know that we will not always agree on everything. As in any partnership, the important thing is to have positions on the table clearly spelt out, and to work together to achieve common objectives.\nI would like to comment briefly on some of the important issues raised in the comments and motions for resolutions.\nFirst, actions count more than words. The European Union has a responsibility to turn its aspirations into reality. It must promote prosperity, cohesion and social justice, both at home and beyond our borders. The Commission is fully committed to this task. We have already started to work towards this goal by implementing our work programme for 2005: we are on track.\nSecond, competitiveness and social cohesion need to go hand in hand. We all know that striking a balance is difficult. I want the Commission to be helpful in this regard. This requires listening carefully to your opinions and contributions.\nTake the REACH initiative, for example. Let me assure you that we have taken due note of the concerns expressed. We all agree on the need to protect the safety of individuals and the environment properly. On the other hand, we should also address the fear that certain elements of the proposal would put a key European industry in serious difficulty without adding real value in the fields of health and the environment. Throughout the legislative process, we will continue to look into further possibilities to refine and improve the balance between regulation and competitiveness.\nWith regard to the draft services directive, here too we are pursuing an aim which commands general support – the completion of the single market for services by 2010. Again I can assure you that we have taken due note of the concerns expressed. I am fully convinced that, via the legislative process, we will be able to settle upon an instrument which will tap the single market's hidden potential without jeopardising legitimate public interest objectives.\nLet us do this on an informed basis and dispel the myths. Our proposals do not call into question the responsibility of Member States when it comes to organising and financing key public services as required by their societal needs, nor do they undermine the rules on the posting of workers as laid down in the directive.\nFinally, I shall mention the Stability and Growth Pact. The Commission is committed to helping improve the pact and ensuring it fully complies with the Treaty. The improvements proposed by the Commission aim to increase its economic rationale and refine its implementation. We want better incentives to foster 'good policies' in 'good times'. We want a better definition of the medium-term objectives of fiscal policy by taking into account elements such as the debt level and the up-front costs of structural reforms. We want to avoid undesirable fiscal restraint in a downturn, because, ultimately, we want our budgets to be in a position to enhance prosperity by focusing expenditure on growth-oriented sectors and by investing for the future.\nThese are not academic issues – this is about quality of life, people's opportunities to earn a living and reap the benefits of their savings and pensions. This is about the chances of current and future generations to lead as full a life as they can legitimately expect to.\nAs part of this balanced approach, the Commission has made progress via its recently adopted proposal on the revised social agenda for the period up to 2010. This shows the Commission's full commitment to modernising and developing European social systems, to tackling social exclusion and poverty, and to attaining the target of more and better jobs.\nWhen liberalising markets, individuals must not be forgotten. That is why last week we adopted two new proposals to strengthen passengers' rights. This brings me to a key issue: the European Union needs to be given sufficient financial means to act. Cohesion policy is and must remain central to the purpose of the Union. Without solidarity, we can never be united. It is an essential complement to competitiveness and the Lisbon Strategy – raising prosperity levels in the less-developed regions of the Union benefits the Union as a whole.\nWe should also bear in mind that there are now 25 Member States. The new Member States are waiting for tangible proof of our solidarity. This is why our proposals for a new generation of cohesion policies for the next Financial Perspective are of critical importance for the Union, both economically and politically. We cannot afford to see our obligations in this area watered down.\nIn addition, the Commission is currently preparing its third package of proposals for the next Financial Perspective, which are based on a careful examination of their European added value with respect to providing citizens with opportunities that complement national approaches or fill existing gaps. This set of instruments will include proposals on the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Development; consumer protection and public health; energy – including renewable energy sources; competitiveness and innovation in respect of freedom, security and justice.\nThe Commission is doing its work, but making these proposals a reality will very much depend on the terms of the agreement on the Financial Perspectives expected by June. As I said before, I do not see how the Commission can contribute to a Europe which aims to do more, but with less resources.\n(FR) Honourable Members, sustainable development and the issue of climate change are both firmly rooted in the Commission’s agenda. Although we are delighted that the Kyoto Protocol has come into force, we cannot however stop there. On 9 February, we adopted a communication on sustainable development and another entitled ‘Winning the battle against global climate change’. These proposals supplement those relating to the mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy. Alongside the economic pillar, the sustainable development strategy and the new social agenda constitute two other supplementary pillars upon which our strategy for the next five years will be based.\nNaturally, we must also look beyond our borders. We shall be able this year to take stock of the progress made in achieving the Millennium Development Goals. The situation is clearly disappointing. The European Union can and must make a larger contribution to achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Next month, we shall publish our contribution to the current review exercise. We must be more dynamic and more imaginative in giving concrete expression to our Monterrey Commitments. In doing so, our main priority will be Africa, and we intend to propose specific new initiatives for Africa.\nMultilateralism and the reinforced Neighbourhood Policy are also priorities for the Commission. Renewed involvement in the peace process in the Middle East and revitalising transatlantic relations are also key objectives. When we meet President Bush tomorrow, we shall share with him our wish for effective multilateralism and our commitment to work for peace and provide humanitarian aid wherever required.\nWe all share the belief that it is our action for the benefit of Europeans that is the source of legitimacy for our daily work. Increasing public involvement is a priority for the Commission and, in order to fulfil this duty, we shall propose a specific programme within the framework of the Financial Perspective. By providing people with simple and transparent information on the subject, they will be in a better position to understand what is at stake in Europe and to form opinions. All the Commissioners – including, principally, Vice-President Wallström, whose particular area this is – have undertaken to exert themselves in this area.\nAllow me, in conclusion, to explain how the Commission, of which I have the honour of being President, intends to meet these shared challenges and address these shared concerns. The method we will use will be partnership, particularly between the European institutions. I should like to repeat what I have already said on many occasions before this House, namely that I intend to develop a constructive rapport between the Commission and the European Parliament. I was delighted to see, during the debate of 26 January, that President Juncker and many Members of this House agree on the importance of working together on the strategic objectives proposed by the Commission. This would be an unprecedented step towards greater coherence in the action taken by the EU.\nFinally, the Commission wants to work very closely with Parliament in the spirit of the proposed partnership. Vice-President Wallström will be present tomorrow at the Conference of Committee Chairmen, and this within the framework of what the Commission wishes to be a permanent and regular dialogue concerning the issues that have priority for us, from the points of view both of programming and of establishing political priorities.\nTo summarise, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want the Work Programme for 2005 to be the first achievement of the partnership I am proposing to you for the renewal of Europe. I shall be happy to hear now your comments and suggestions regarding its content.",

I am fully convinced that, via the legislative process, we will be able to settle upon an instrument which will tap the single market's hidden potential without jeopardising legitimate public interest objectives.\nLet us do this on an informed basis and dispel the myths. Our proposals do not call into question the responsibility of Member States when it comes to organising and financing key public services as required by their societal needs, nor do they undermine the rules on the posting of workers as laid down in the directive.\nFinally, I shall mention the Stability and Growth Pact. The Commission is committed to helping improve the pact and ensuring it fully complies with the Treaty. The improvements proposed by the Commission aim to increase its economic rationale and refine its implementation. We want better incentives to foster 'good policies' in 'good times'. We want a better definition of the medium-term objectives of fiscal policy by taking into account elements such as the debt level and the up-front costs of structural reforms. We want to avoid undesirable fiscal restraint in a downturn, because, ultimately, we want our budgets to be in a position to enhance prosperity by focusing expenditure on growth-oriented sectors and by investing for the future.\nThese are not academic issues – this is about quality of life, people's opportunities to earn a living and reap the benefits of their savings and pensions. This is about the chances of current and future generations to lead as full a life as they can legitimately expect to.\nAs part of this balanced approach, the Commission has made progress via its recently adopted proposal on the revised social agenda for the period up to 2010. This shows the Commission's full commitment to modernising and developing European social systems, to tackling social exclusion and poverty, and to attaining the target of more and better jobs.\nWhen liberalising markets, individuals must not be forgotten. That is why last week we adopted two new proposals to strengthen passengers' rights. This brings me to a key issue: the European Union needs to be given sufficient financial means to act. Cohesion policy is and must remain central to the purpose of the Union. Without solidarity, we can never be united. It is an essential complement to competitiveness and the Lisbon Strategy – raising prosperity levels in the less-developed regions of the Union benefits the Union as a whole.\nWe should also bear in mind that there are now 25 Member States. The new Member States are waiting for tangible proof of our solidarity. This is why our proposals for a new generation of cohesion policies for the next Financial Perspective are of critical importance for the Union, both economically and politically. We cannot afford to see our obligations in this area watered down.\nIn addition, the Commission is currently preparing its third package of proposals for the next Financial Perspective, which are based on a careful examination of their European added value with respect to providing citizens with opportunities that complement national approaches or fill existing gaps. This set of instruments will include proposals on the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Development; consumer protection and public health; energy – including renewable energy sources; competitiveness and innovation in respect of freedom, security and justice.\nThe Commission is doing its work, but making these proposals a reality will very much depend on the terms of the agreement on the Financial Perspectives expected by June. As I said before, I do not see how the Commission can contribute to a Europe which aims to do more, but with less resources.\n(FR) Honourable Members, sustainable development and the issue of climate change are both firmly rooted in the Commission’s agenda. Although we are delighted that the Kyoto Protocol has come into force, we cannot however stop there. On 9 February, we adopted a communication on sustainable development and another entitled ‘Winning the battle against global climate change’. These proposals supplement those relating to the mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy. Alongside the economic pillar, the sustainable development strategy and the new social agenda constitute two other supplementary pillars upon which our strategy for the next five years will be based.\nNaturally, we must also look beyond our borders. We shall be able this year to take stock of the progress made in achieving the Millennium Development Goals. The situation is clearly disappointing. The European Union can and must make a larger contribution to achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Next month, we shall publish our contribution to the current review exercise. We must be more dynamic and more imaginative in giving concrete expression to our Monterrey Commitments. In doing so, our main priority will be Africa, and we intend to propose specific new initiatives for Africa.\nMultilateralism and the reinforced Neighbourhood Policy are also priorities for the Commission. Renewed involvement in the peace process in the Middle East and revitalising transatlantic relations are also key objectives. When we meet President Bush tomorrow, we shall share with him our wish for effective multilateralism and our commitment to work for peace and provide humanitarian aid wherever required.\nWe all share the belief that it is our action for the benefit of Europeans that is the source of legitimacy for our daily work. Increasing public involvement is a priority for the Commission and, in order to fulfil this duty, we shall propose a specific programme within the framework of the Financial Perspective. By providing people with simple and transparent information on the subject, they will be in a better position to understand what is at stake in Europe and to form opinions. All the Commissioners – including, principally, Vice-President Wallström, whose particular area this is – have undertaken to exert themselves in this area.\nAllow me, in conclusion, to explain how the Commission, of which I have the honour of being President, intends to meet these shared challenges and address these shared concerns. The method we will use will be partnership, particularly between the European institutions. I should like to repeat what I have already said on many occasions before this House, namely that I intend to develop a constructive rapport between the Commission and the European Parliament. I was delighted to see, during the debate of 26 January, that President Juncker and many Members of this House agree on the importance of working together on the strategic objectives proposed by the Commission. This would be an unprecedented step towards greater coherence in the action taken by the EU.\nFinally, the Commission wants to work very closely with Parliament in the spirit of the proposed partnership. Vice-President Wallström will be present tomorrow at the Conference of Committee Chairmen, and this within the framework of what the Commission wishes to be a permanent and regular dialogue concerning the issues that have priority for us, from the points of view both of programming and of establishing political priorities.\nTo summarise, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want the Work Programme for 2005 to be the first achievement of the partnership I am proposing to you for the renewal of Europe. I shall be happy to hear now your comments and suggestions regarding its content."

      "english": "Grossetête (PPE-DE), on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. – (FR) Mr President, we are very happy that President Barroso has been able to join us and that we are able to examine with him this 2005 programme, the presentation of which has been delayed, albeit for reasons of which we are aware.\nMr Barroso, we know that you will do everything to bring about even greater effectiveness. Your programme is ambitious, and we have every confidence in you – confidence that we should very much like to re-affirm, as you have been an attentive listener, specifically to ourselves. Indeed, you took the initiative to review the Directive on Services in order to take account of our concerns. The same applies to REACH, as you have just explained to us.\nWe must therefore concentrate on the key issues, namely growth and employment. Fewer laws and better lawmaking will be the main thrust of our work. I know that we are on the same wavelength as you on this subject. You also spoke to us about actions to be taken. Productivity in Europe is increasing half as fast as in the United States, where the average growth in investment is 5.4% per year, compared with 1.7% for European investments.\nWhat our fellow citizens are waiting for are, in fact, practical changes that can be described in simple terms: seeing purchasing power increase and no longer needing to fear unemployment or relocation. It is therefore with impatience that we await your framework programme for competitiveness and innovation, including precise objectives and pre-arranged meetings.\nIncreasing growth and employment means relying upon innovation and research and, above all, reconciling environmental and industrial policies. These two policies are not contradictory, in fact quite the opposite is true; they are complementary. Environmental considerations are not constraints or obstacles. They are assets and present an opportunity for our economy. Europe must therefore opt for eco-innovation and cutting-edge technologies in order to meet a demand for high added value products that our competitors cannot satisfy.\nThanks to its high environmental standards, the European Union stimulates innovation and increases the competitive ability of European industry. I have in mind the development of renewable energy sources, including solar and wind power, of biofuels and of clean forms of transport – all sectors that offer our industries a real opportunity in terms of employment and exports. We note your proposals in this area with interest, particularly the regulation on the measures to be taken to combat forms of air pollution.\nViable economic development and renewed growth depend above all upon both the health of our companies and the health of the men and women who make our economy work. We value that part of your programme concerning health and consumer policy. Europe must also anticipate the possible threats from major scourges and combat the new epidemics and resistance to antibiotics. It is therefore with great interest that we await the proposal for a directive aimed at putting Community measures in place to combat avian influenza. We shall have to act quickly and effectively.\nRegarding demographic development in Europe, the Green Paper must quickly be followed up by practical measures involving, for example, lifelong learning, health systems that can be relied upon over time and research into neurodegenerative diseases. As far as solidarity policy is concerned, it is only right that the new Member States should benefit from these programmes, but do not forget that the funds in question also convey the image of the European Union across all the Member States. It is therefore vital for all the countries to have access to these forms of structural aid.\nWe also call for greater efficiency in the way in which Member States follow up each other’s judicial decisions, although, on this subject, we were still awaiting the results of the codecision provided for by the Constitution. We know that all this should help improve Europeans’ mobility. In particular, we must also improve young people’s mobility by facilitating university exchanges and having people benefit from the terrific experience constituted by career routes to the professions.\nWe are ambitious, and so are you. We wish to develop and improve working conditions with a view to putting practical measures in place and improving work-life balance. That is how we shall be able to fulfil the objective that the EU must pursue, so enhancing the whole of European society. The European Commission must be visionary in its initiating role.\nIn the field of policy, we would emphasise Euro-Mediterranean relations. Euro-Mediterranean policy must be much stronger and be accorded priority. In the same way, we must turn our attention to our European borders.\nIn conclusion, I should like to say to you that political will must be reflected in a Financial Perspective that is evaluated for what it really is. The Member States cannot ask more of Europe while giving less. What, therefore, we now need is political energy for kick-starting the engine that drives our efforts – efforts that are the basis of our work. You have that energy. We shall be at your side in that spirit of constructive rapport you mentioned.",

      "original": "Grossetête (PPE-DE), au nom du groupe . - Monsieur le Président, nous sommes très heureux que le Président Barroso ait pu nous rejoindre et que nous puissions examiner avec lui ce programme 2005 qui avait pris du retard, mais nous en connaissons les raisons.\nNous savons, Monsieur Barroso, que vous ferez tout pour redoubler d’efficacité. Votre programme est ambitieux et nous vous faisons confiance, une confiance que nous tenons à vous renouveler, car vous avez su être à l’écoute, à notre écoute: vous avez en effet pris l’initiative de revoir la directive relative aux services pour prendre en compte nos préoccupations. Il en est de même pour REACH, comme vous venez de nous l’expliquer.\nNous devrons donc nous concentrer sur l’essentiel: la croissance et l’emploi. Moins et mieux légiférer sera notre axe de travail. Je sais que nous sommes en phase avec vous sur ce sujet. Vous nous avez d’ailleurs parlé d’actions. Le niveau de productivité en Europe augmente deux fois moins vite qu’aux USA, où la croissance moyenne des investissements est de 5,4% par an contre 1,7% pour les investissements européens.\nCe qu’attendent nos concitoyens, ce sont bien des changements concrets qui se traduisent en termes simples: ne plus craindre les délocalisations, ne plus avoir peur du chômage et voir augmenter le pouvoir d’achat. Nous attendons donc avec impatience votre programme-cadre pour la compétitivité et l’innovation, avec des objectifs et des rendez-vous précis.\nDévelopper la croissance et l’emploi, c’est s’appuyer sur l’innovation et la recherche, c’est surtout réconcilier politique de l’environnement et politique industrielle. Ces deux politiques ne sont pas contradictoires, au contraire, elles sont complémentaires. Les considérations environnementales ne sont pas des contraintes ou des entraves. Elles sont des atouts, une chance pour notre économie. L’Europe doit donc jouer la carte de l’éco-innovation et des technologies de pointe afin de pouvoir répondre à une demande de produits à haute valeur ajoutée que nos concurrents ne peuvent satisfaire.\nGrâce à des normes environnementales élevées, l’Union européenne stimule l’innovation et augmente les capacités compétitives de son industrie. Je songe au développement des énergies renouvelables, entre autres aux énergies éolienne et solaire, aux biocarburants, aux transports propres, autant de secteurs qui offrent à nos industries une véritable chance en termes d’emploi et d’exportations. Nous notons avec intérêt, Monsieur le Président de la Commission, vos propositions dans ce domaine, notamment le règlement sur les mesures à prendre contre les pollutions de l’air.\nUn développement économique viable, une croissance retrouvée s’appuient avant tout sur la santé de nos entreprises, mais aussi sur la santé des hommes et des femmes qui sont les acteurs de notre économie. Nous apprécions le volet de votre programme qui concerne la santé et la politique des consommateurs. L’Europe doit aussi anticiper les menaces éventuelles de grands fléaux, lutter contre les nouvelles formes d’épidémie, les résistances aux antibiotiques. C’est donc avec grand intérêt que nous attendons la proposition de directive visant à mettre en place des mesures communautaires de lutte contre la grippe aviaire. Il nous faudra faire vite et bien.\nEn ce qui concerne l’évolution démographique en Europe, le livre vert doit rapidement être suivi de mesures concrètes: apprentissage tout au long de la vie, pérennité de nos systèmes de santé, recherche sur les maladies neurodégénératives. Concernant la politique de solidarité, il est juste que les nouveaux entrants bénéficient de ces programmes, mais n’oubliez pas que les fonds concernés véhiculent aussi l’image de l’Union européenne à travers tous les États membres. Il est donc indispensable que tous les pays puissent accéder à ces aides structurelles.\nNous demandons également plus d’efficacité dans le suivi des décisions de justice entre États membres, bien qu’à ce sujet nous attendions encore les résultats de la codécision telle que prévue par la Constitution. Nous savons que tout cela doit contribuer à améliorer la mobilité des Européens. Nous devons également améliorer la mobilité de la jeunesse plus spécifiquement: faciliter les échanges universitaires, faire profiter de ces formidables expériences que sont les filières professionnelles.\nNous avons de l’ambition, vous en avez aussi. Nous souhaitons développer et améliorer les conditions de travail pour aboutir à la mise en place de mesures concrètes, améliorer l’équilibre entre vie familiale et vie professionnelle. C’est ainsi que nous pourrons remplir l’objectif que l’Union doit poursuivre et tirer l’ensemble de la société européenne vers le haut. Dans son rôle d’initiative, la Commission européenne doit être visionnaire.\nDans le domaine de la politique, nous insistons sur les relations euro-méditerranéennes. La politique euro-méditerranéenne doit être beaucoup plus forte. Elle doit être prioritaire. De même, nous devons nous pencher sur nos frontières, les frontières de l’Europe.\nPour terminer, je souhaiterais, Monsieur le Président de la Commission, vous dire que la volonté politique doit se traduire par des perspectives financières qui doivent, elles, être évaluées à leur juste mesure. Les États membres ne peuvent demander plus à l’Europe en donnant moins. C’est donc aujourd’hui d’énergie politique que nous avons besoin pour mettre en route le moteur de nos performances, lesquelles sont l’essence même de nos emplois. Cette énergie, vous l’avez. Nous serons à vos côtés, Monsieur le Président, dans cet esprit de complicité positive dont vous nous avez parlé.",

      "speaker": "Schulz (PSE),",
      "english": "Schulz (PSE), on behalf of the PSE Group. – (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the speech we have just heard was not a speech from the European People’s Party, but from the French Gaullists. Mrs Grossetête, given the substance of your speech, I cordially invite you to join us, and we shall quickly secure majorities for socially responsible policies in the European Union. I saw the profound shock in the eyes of my fellow Member, Mr Poettering, and it was a real treat to observe his reaction.\nPresident Barroso, I am delighted that you have managed to be with us in spite of the present demands on your time. I want to make that very clear. We are all aware of the problems you experienced in London with your flight. Your presence here augurs well for cooperation between the Commission and the European Parliament. Let me emphasise that. But enough of these pleasantries, for I also have one or two remarks to make that I believe you will be less happy to hear.\nI do not wish to return to the issue of whether it was right or wrong for you to appear in an advert for the PSD in Portugal. That is in the past now. I would like to make a serious proposal, however, with regard to the negotiations on the framework agreement. We must make a decision. There is a provision in the framework agreement between Parliament and the Commission which clearly states that Commissioners are not forbidden to engage in political activities in their home countries, provided they discuss the activity beforehand with the President of the Commission, who either gives his consent to whatever is necessary for the performance of the activity or expresses his misgivings.\nThere is no rule, however, for the President, although his conduct should, of course, be exemplary. I personally have no problem whatsoever with the principle that the Commissioners, or you as President of the Commission, have a set of political views and can air those views in public. I am well aware of where your political affiliation lies. It goes without saying that you are not required to go around hypocritically pretending that your election to the presidency of the Commission has made you politically neutral. I believe it is only right that you should continue to uphold your views, but the same rule must apply to the President and the Commissioners alike, whether it authorises or forbids all of you to engage in national politics. Saying ‘yes’ to some and ‘no’ to others is unacceptable. This is why I suggest that we clarify this matter in the framework agreement.\nA second remark, Mr President; in our most recent discussion of your work programme, I said on behalf of our group that we saw the glass as half full. I said this because we had seen encouraging signs that you were heeding the appeals which we Socialists had been making to you and your Commission.\nThen, a few days later, I found an interview with you in the Financial Times in which you took a completely different line from the one you had presented when you addressed this Parliament. ‘Economy is in the front seat’, you were now saying. No! Social coherence is in the front seat – at least for us Socialists, Mr President – and we shall not release you from your obligations on this score. You presented a work programme with Socialist elements but then gave an interview in the Financial Times which went in the very opposite direction. Later, Mr Špidla presented a paper to which we Socialists can heartily subscribe, but this was followed by comments in the press by Mrs Hübner which we find absolutely impossible to accept.\nYou made it to the Berlaymont building, Mr President, but I have the impression that, whenever you arrive at the Schuman roundabout, you are no longer sure which exit to take. For this reason, let me suggest that you follow our Socialist proposals, because the problem with the European Union is this: if we do not make it clear to the public that this Union of ours offers them social security, and allow them to carrying on thinking that Brussels is out to destroy their social security, the risks we incur will outweigh the opportunities we create. Until we stop conveying that impression, citizens will continue to turn their backs on Europe.\nThis has to do with the fact that the neo-liberal approach is presented – perhaps not by you, Mr Barroso, but by many of your Commissioners and, what is far worse, by a great many of your officials within the Commission as a fact of everyday life; all will be well with Europe, so the theory goes, when it is deregulated, made more flexible, and locked into a downward social spiral. As long as this is the main thrust of your Commission’s policies, the climate will never change in favour of the EU. We Socialists have not been elected to support the sort of neo-liberal policies that are enshrined in the Bolkestein directive, but to guarantee both sides of the coin on which our discussions have long been focused. On the one hand, we need competition and flexibility, but this increase in competition and flexibility must serve to promote the achievement of the other goal, namely social stability.\nFor this reason, I ask you to stand by what you said in your strategic guidelines and what you presented to us, together with Mrs Wallström and Mr Verheugen, in the Lisbon strategy, which formulates these very principles: greater flexibility and more competition, certainly, but also an enduring commitment to the social structures that are Europe’s greatest achievement. If you read our resolution, you will see that we are willing to engage in constructive cooperation with you, but only if you, along with your Commission, are willing to build a social Europe. Then we shall gladly give you our backing.\n(Applause)",

Die Rede, die wir gerade gehört haben, war keine Rede der PPE, es war eine Rede der französischen Gaullisten. Frau Grossetête, ich lade Sie herzlich ein, sich mit den Inhalten Ihrer Rede uns anzuschließen, dann werden wir schnell Mehrheiten für eine sozial verantwortliche Politik in der Europäischen Union bekommen. Ich habe das tiefe Erschrecken in den Augen meines Kollegen Pöttering gesehen, und ich habe das auch mit Freude zur Kenntnis genommen.\nHerr Präsident Barroso! Ich freue mich, dass Sie trotz der schwierigen terminlichen Situation, in der Sie sind, den Weg zu uns gefunden haben. Ich will das ausdrücklich sagen! Wir wissen alle, dass Sie in London noch Schwierigkeiten mit dem Flug hatten. Dass Sie hier sind, ist ein gutes Zeichen für die Zusammenarbeit zwischen der Kommission und dem Europäischen Parlament. Dies will ich hier ausdrücklich erwähnen. Damit habe ich Ihnen aber auch schon genug Freude gemacht, denn ich muss die eine oder andere Bemerkung machen, von der ich glaube, dass sie Sie nicht so fröhlich stimmen wird.\nIch will nicht mehr auf die Frage zurückkommen, ob es richtig war, dass Sie in einem Werbespot für die PSD in Portugal aufgetreten sind. Das ist jetzt vorbei. Aber ich möchte ernsthaft folgenden Vorschlag unterbreiten: Was die Verhandlungen zum Rahmenabkommen angeht, müssen wir uns entscheiden. Es gibt eine Regelung im Rahmenabkommen zwischen Parlament und Kommission, die klar ist. Den Kommissaren ist es nicht untersagt, sich in ihren Heimatländern politisch zu betätigen. Sie müssen dies – so sieht dieses Rahmenabkommen vor – mit dem Präsidenten der Kommission besprechen. Und der Präsident der Kommission gibt im Rahmen der Notwendigkeiten sein Einverständnis oder äußert seine Skepsis.\nEs gibt aber keine Regel für den Präsidenten, wobei dieser natürlich eigentlich ein Vorbild sein müsste. Ich persönlich habe überhaupt kein Problem damit, dass Kommissarinnen oder Kommissare, oder Sie als Kommissionspräsident, eine politische Linie haben und dies auch nach außen klar machen. Ich weiß ja eh, wo Sie politisch stehen. Sie brauchen ja nicht heuchlerisch rumzulaufen und so zu tun, als hätten Sie sich ab Ihrer Wahl zum Kommissionspräsident zum politischen Neutrum verwandelt. Also, stehen Sie zu Ihrer Meinung, ich finde das gut, dann aber alle, der Präsident wie die Kommissare, oder alle nicht. Aber mal ja und mal nein, das geht nicht. Deshalb schlage ich vor, dass wir diese Frage im Rahmenabkommen klären.\nEine zweite Bemerkung, Herr Präsident! Ich hatte in der letzten Diskussion, die wir über Ihr Arbeitsprogramm führten, im Namen unser Fraktion gesagt: Das Glas ist halb voll. Dies, weil wir positive Zeichen sehen hinsichtlich der Forderungen, die wir als Sozialdemokraten an Sie und Ihre Kommission stellen.\nDann schlage ich einige Tage später die Financial Times auf und sehe ein Interview mit Ihnen, das in eine absolut andere Richtung geht als die, die Sie in Ihrer Rede hier im Parlament vorgetragen hatten: Economy is in the front seat. Nein! Social coherence is in the front seat – jedenfalls für uns Sozialdemokraten, Herr Präsident, und aus dieser Forderung werden wir Sie nicht entlassen. Sie präsentieren Ihr Arbeitsprogramm mit sozialdemokratischen Elementen, geben aber dann in der Financial Times ein Interview, das genau in die entgegengesetzte Richtung geht. Später legt Herr Spidla ein Papier vor, mit dem wir Sozialdemokraten wunderbar leben können, doch dann bekommen wir wieder Äußerungen von Frau Hübner in der Presse zu lesen, die wir absolut nicht akzeptieren können.\nSie sind zwar im Berlaymont angekommen, Herr Präsident, aber ich habe den Eindruck, immer wenn Sie auf dem Schuman-Kreisel sind, wissen Sie nicht mehr, welche Ausfahrt Sie nehmen sollen. Deshalb mache ich Ihnen einen Vorschlag: Fahren Sie in Richtung unserer sozialdemokratischen Vorschläge, denn das Problem der Europäischen Union liegt darin, dass, wenn wir den Bürgerinnen und Bürgern nicht klarmachen, dass diese Union ihnen soziale Sicherheit bietet, sondern es länger zulassen, dass die Bürger den Eindruck haben, das, was in Brüssel geschieht, zerstöre die soziale Sicherheit, dies uns mehr Risiken als Chancen bringt. Solange wir das zulassen, werden sich die Bürger von Europa abwenden.\nDies hat damit zu tun, dass der neoliberale Ansatz – vielleicht nicht bei Ihnen, Herr Barroso, aber bei vielen Ihrer Kommissare, und was noch viel schlimmer ist, bei ganz vielen Ihrer Beamten in der Kommission – als alltägliche Selbstverständlichkeit dargestellt wird; dass Europa nur dann gut ist, wenn es dereguliert, flexibilisiert wird und in sozialer Hinsicht immer nur nach unten geht. Solange dies in Ihrer Kommission die Hauptintonation ist, solange wird sich die Atmosphäre nicht zugunsten der EU wenden. Wir Sozialdemokraten sind nicht gewählt worden, um eine neoliberale Politik, wie sie die Bolkestein-Richtlinie vorsah, zu unterstützen, sondern um die zwei Seiten der Medaille, über die wir schon lange diskutieren, auch zu garantieren. Auf der einen Seite brauchen wir Wettbewerb und Flexibilität, aber diese Steigerung von Wettbewerb und Flexibilität muss der anderen Seite dienen, nämlich der sozialen Stabilität.\nDeshalb bitte ich Sie, bleiben Sie bei dem, was Sie in Ihren strategischen Leitlinien vorgetragen haben, und bei dem, was Sie uns gemeinsam mit Margot Wallström und Günther Verheugen in der Lissabon-Strategie vorgestellt haben, wo nämlich genau das formuliert ist. Flexibilisierung, mehr Wettbewerb: ja; aber immer unter Wahrung der sozialen Strukturen, die Europas Errungenschaft sind. Wenn Sie unsere Entschließung lesen, werden Sie sehen, dass wir zu einer sehr konstruktiven Zusammenarbeit mit Ihnen bereit sind, aber nur dann, wenn Sie auch Ihrerseits bereit sind, mit Ihrer Kommission das soziale Europa zu verwirklichen. Dann reichen wir Ihnen gerne die Hand.\n(Beifall)",

      "formatted_summary": "Schulz (PSE), on behalf of the PSE Group. – (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the speech we have just heard was not a speech from the European People’s Party, but from the French Gaullists. Mrs Grossetête, given the substance of your speech, I cordially invite you to join us, and we shall quickly secure majorities for socially responsible policies in the European Union. I saw the profound shock in the eyes of my fellow Member, Mr Poettering, and it was a real treat to observe his reaction.\nPresident Barroso, I am delighted that you have managed to be with us in spite of the present demands on your time. I want to make that very clear. We are all aware of the problems you experienced in London with your flight. Your presence here augurs well for cooperation between the Commission and the European Parliament. Let me emphasise that. But enough of these pleasantries, for I also have one or two remarks to make that I believe you will be less happy to hear.\nI do not wish to return to the issue of whether it was right or wrong for you to appear in an advert for the PSD in Portugal. That is in the past now. I would like to make a serious proposal, however, with regard to the negotiations on the framework agreement. We must make a decision. There is a provision in the framework agreement between Parliament and the Commission which clearly states that Commissioners are not forbidden to engage in political activities in their home countries, provided they discuss the activity beforehand with the President of the Commission, who either gives his consent to whatever is necessary for the performance of the activity or expresses his misgivings.\nThere is no rule, however, for the President, although his conduct should, of course, be exemplary. I personally have no problem whatsoever with the principle that the Commissioners, or you as President of the Commission, have a set of political views and can air those views in public. I am well aware of where your political affiliation lies. It goes without saying that you are not required to go around hypocritically pretending that your election to the presidency of the Commission has made you politically neutral. I believe it is only right that you should continue to uphold your views, but the same rule must apply to the President and the Commissioners alike, whether it authorises or forbids all of you to engage in national politics. Saying ‘yes’ to some and ‘no’ to others is unacceptable. This is why I suggest that we clarify this matter in the framework agreement.\nA second remark, Mr President; in our most recent discussion of your work programme, I said on behalf of our group that we saw the glass as half full. I said this because we had seen encouraging signs that you were heeding the appeals which we Socialists had been making to you and your Commission.\nThen, a few days later, I found an interview with you in the Financial Times in which you took a completely different line from the one you had presented when you addressed this Parliament. ‘Economy is in the front seat’, you were now saying. No! Social coherence is in the front seat – at least for us Socialists, Mr President – and we shall not release you from your obligations on this score. You presented a work programme with Socialist elements but then gave an interview in the Financial Times which went in the very opposite direction. Later, Mr Špidla presented a paper to which we Socialists can heartily subscribe, but this was followed by comments in the press by Mrs Hübner which we find absolutely impossible to accept.\nYou made it to the Berlaymont building, Mr President, but I have the impression that, whenever you arrive at the Schuman roundabout, you are no longer sure which exit to take. For this reason, let me suggest that you follow our Socialist proposals, because the problem with the European Union is this: if we do not make it clear to the public that this Union of ours offers them social security, and allow them to carrying on thinking that Brussels is out to destroy their social security, the risks we incur will outweigh the opportunities we create. Until we stop conveying that impression, citizens will continue to turn their backs on Europe.\nThis has to do with the fact that the neo-liberal approach is presented – perhaps not by you, Mr Barroso, but by many of your Commissioners and, what is far worse, by a great many of your officials within the Commission as a fact of everyday life; all will be well with Europe, so the theory goes, when it is deregulated, made more flexible, and locked into a downward social spiral. As long as this is the main thrust of your Commission’s policies, the climate will never change in favour of the EU. We Socialists have not been elected to support the sort of neo-liberal policies that are enshrined in the Bolkestein directive, but to guarantee both sides of the coin on which our discussions have long been focused. On the one hand, we need competition and flexibility, but this increase in competition and flexibility must serve to promote the achievement of the other goal, namely social stability.\nFor this reason, I ask you to stand by what you said in your strategic guidelines and what you presented to us, together with Mrs Wallström and Mr Verheugen, in the Lisbon strategy, which formulates these very principles: greater flexibility and more competition, certainly, but also an enduring commitment to the social structures that are Europe’s greatest achievement. If you read our resolution, you will see that we are willing to engage in constructive cooperation with you, but only if you, along with your Commission, are willing to build a social Europe. Then we shall gladly give you our backing.\n(Applause)"

      "english": "Beer (Verts/ALE), on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . – (DE) Madam President, President Barroso has just proposed complicity in a good cause between the Commission and Parliament. On behalf of my group, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I should like to refer to two possible areas of complicity in the light of current events. You mentioned the most relevant event yourself, Mr Barroso, namely the forthcoming talks in Brussels with the President of the United States.\nI believe that, following Condoleezza Rice’s charm offensive in Europe, it must and it will emerge in the coming days and weeks – and the Iran issue will be the acid test – whether we have only one common goal and continue to go our own separate ways, or whether we manage to develop multilateral measures and avert the danger of unilateralism, which we saw during the preventive war against Iraq.\nOn behalf of my group, may I warmly encourage you and strongly urge the Commission to make every effort in the forthcoming talks to persuade the US Administration to lend its active support to the negotiating strategy of the three EU representatives.\nLet me reiterate the common aims of both the American and the European negotiators and the EU Member States. Our aim is complete consensus. We must prevent the further proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in the wider Middle East. We must press on with the development of a political strategy for the wider Middle East on the basis of the European security strategy. We must succeed in enshrining a binding commitment by Iran to refrain from military use of the potential created by its nuclear programme, and we need unlimited access for the International Atomic Energy Agency to enable it to inspect all of Iran’s nuclear facilities. These are the prerequisites for the creation of a ring of security around every country in the region, including Israel.\nI am convinced that the European negotiations are the right way forward and are far more likely to succeed if we can persuade President Bush not merely to wait in the wings, not to engage in verbal sabre-rattling and not to keep open the option of a preventive attack, but to put on the agenda an active review of the current economic sanctions against Iran, as well as discussing security guarantees for Iran.\nI believe we shall advance in this area if we also remain true to our principle of safeguarding human rights. I appeal specifically to the Commission not to shelve the dialogue on human rights for the duration of the negotiations, but to intensify it. I very much regret having to say this, but I have learned that the German Government, the selfsame Government which is actively supporting our negotiations on the EU side, has instituted deportation proceedings against a 26-year-old woman who obtained a divorce from her Iranian husband and converted to Christianity. Deportation to Iran in these circumstances – and we have opposed it in two previous resolutions – exposes a woman to the danger of stoning, persecution or even death.\nI believe that such a bipolar policy makes it difficult, but we must manage to rally a majority in Europe behind a coherent human rights policy. That will establish our credibility on the Iran issue. I have no wish to see Iran succeed in playing off the Europeans against the Americans, because we both have the same objectives. I must re-emphasise that point.\nLet me also refer at this juncture to another issue where my group is in agreement with the President of the United States, namely the continuation of the embargo against China. If we say that the criterion of respect for human rights is fundamental to our European foreign policy, we must acknowledge that the human rights situation in China remains appalling, and it was for this reason that the House adopted a resolution only a few weeks ago in which it rejected the initiative launched by President Chirac and Chancellor Schröder. We expect this embargo to be maintained and reaffirm that economic interests must not take precedence over human rights.",
      "lang": "DE",
      "original": "Beer (Verts/ALE), im Namen der Verts/ALE-Fraktion . – Frau Präsidentin, Herr Präsident Barroso! Sie haben gerade eine positive Komplizenschaft zwischen Kommission und Parlament angeboten. Für meine Fraktion, Die Grünen, möchte ich aus aktuellem Anlass zwei solche Möglichkeiten der Komplizenschaft benennen. Sie haben den aktuellen Anlass selbst genannt: Es sind die bevorstehenden Gespräche mit dem US-Präsidenten in Brüssel.\nIch denke, dass nach der Charme-Offensive von Condoleezza Rice in Europa sich in den nächsten Tagen und Wochen zeigen wird und zeigen muss – und zwar in der Iran-Frage –, ob wir nur ein gemeinsames Ziel haben und nach wie vor getrennte Wege gehen, oder ob wir es schaffen, multilaterale Schritte zu entwickeln, und die Gefahr eines Unilateralismus, wie wir ihn im Rahmen des Präventivschlages gegen den Irak erlebt haben, ausschalten können.\nIch möchte Sie im Namen meiner Fraktion ausdrücklich ermuntern und die Kommission eindringlich auffordern, alles Mögliche zu versuchen, um in den bevorstehenden Gesprächen die US-Regierung dazu zu bewegen, die europäische Verhandlungsstrategie der drei EU-Vertreter aktiv zu unterstützen.\nLassen Sie mich noch einmal die gemeinsamen Ziele sowohl der Amerikaner als auch der Europäer und der europäischen Mitgliedsländer nennen. Unser Ziel ist vollkommener Konsens. Wir müssen die weitere Verbreitung von Massenvernichtungswaffen im Nahen und Mittleren Osten verhindern. Wir müssen die Entwicklung einer politischen Strategie für den gesamten Weiteren Nahen und Mittleren Osten auf der Grundlage der europäischen Sicherheitsstrategie vorantreiben. Wir müssen den Verzicht von Iran auf eine militärische Nutzung des Atomprogramms verbindlich festschreiben können, und wir brauchen die unbegrenzte Zutrittsmöglichkeit der IAEO, um sämtliche Anlagen von Iran zu inspizieren. Das sind die Voraussetzungen, um auch für Israel ein sicheres Umfeld zu schaffen.\nIch bin überzeugt davon, dass der richtige Weg der europäischen Verhandlungen eine viel größere Chance hat, positiv zu verlaufen, wenn wir den US-Präsidenten überzeugen können, nicht nur stand by zu sitzen, nicht nur verbal mit dem Säbel zu rasseln, die Frage des Präventivschlages nicht offen zu lassen, sondern eine aktive Überprüfung der geltenden Wirtschaftssanktionen gegenüber Iran auf die Tagesordnung zu setzen und auch über Sicherheitsgarantien für Iran zu reden.\nIch denke, dass wir in diesem Bereich weiterkommen, wenn wir auch unserem Grundsatz der Wahrung der Menschenrechte treu bleiben. Ich appelliere ausdrücklich an die Kommission, den Menschenrechtsdialog mit Iran nicht zurückzustellen, solange die Verhandlungen laufen, sondern diesen zu intensivieren. Ich sage das mit größtem Bedauern, zumal ich feststellen musste, dass ausgerechnet die deutsche Regierung, die ja unsere Verhandlungen auf Seiten der EU aktiv unterstützt, ein Abschiebeverfahren gegen eine 26jährige Frau in die Wege geleitet hat, die sich von ihrem iranischen Mann hat trennen lassen und die zum christlichen Glauben übergetreten ist. Eine Abschiebung nach Iran in dieser Situation – und wir haben uns zweimal mit Entschließungen dagegen gewandt – bedeutet die Gefahr von Steinigung, von Verfolgung, sogar von Tötung.\nIch glaube, dass eine solche gespaltene Politik es schwierig macht, aber wir müssen es schaffen, in Europa eine kohärente Menschenrechtspolitik mehrheitsfähig zu machen. Dann sind wir auch, was Iran betrifft, glaubwürdig. Ich möchte nicht, dass Iran erfolgreich versucht, die Europäer gegen die Amerikaner auszuspielen, denn wir haben die gleichen Zielsetzungen. Dies will ich noch mal unterstreichen.\nEinen Punkt des Konsens meiner Fraktion mit dem US-Präsidenten möchte ich hier auch zur Sprache bringen: Es ist die Frage der Aufrechterhaltung des Embargos gegen China. Wenn wir sagen, das Kriterium „Einhaltung der Menschenrechte“ ist Grundlage unserer europäischen Außenpolitik, dann müssen wir zur Kenntnis nehmen, dass die Menschenrechtssituation in China nach wie vor fatal ist, und aus diesem Grund hat dieses Parlament vor wenigen Wochen eine Entschließung verabschiedet und den Vorstoß der Kanzler Schröder und Chirac zurückgewiesen. Wir erwarten, dass dieses Embargo aufrecht bleibt und nicht Wirtschaftsinteressen zu Lasten der Menschenrechtslage in den Vordergrund gerückt werden.",

      "formatted_summary": "Beer (Verts/ALE), on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . – (DE) Madam President, President Barroso has just proposed complicity in a good cause between the Commission and Parliament. On behalf of my group, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I should like to refer to two possible areas of complicity in the light of current events. You mentioned the most relevant event yourself, Mr Barroso, namely the forthcoming talks in Brussels with the President of the United States.\nI believe that, following Condoleezza Rice’s charm offensive in Europe, it must and it will emerge in the coming days and weeks – and the Iran issue will be the acid test – whether we have only one common goal and continue to go our own separate ways, or whether we manage to develop multilateral measures and avert the danger of unilateralism, which we saw during the preventive war against Iraq.\nOn behalf of my group, may I warmly encourage you and strongly urge the Commission to make every effort in the forthcoming talks to persuade the US Administration to lend its active support to the negotiating strategy of the three EU representatives.\nLet me reiterate the common aims of both the American and the European negotiators and the EU Member States. Our aim is complete consensus. We must prevent the further proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in the wider Middle East. We must press on with the development of a political strategy for the wider Middle East on the basis of the European security strategy. We must succeed in enshrining a binding commitment by Iran to refrain from military use of the potential created by its nuclear programme, and we need unlimited access for the International Atomic Energy Agency to enable it to inspect all of Iran’s nuclear facilities. These are the prerequisites for the creation of a ring of security around every country in the region, including Israel.\nI am convinced that the European negotiations are the right way forward and are far more likely to succeed if we can persuade President Bush not merely to wait in the wings, not to engage in verbal sabre-rattling and not to keep open the option of a preventive attack, but to put on the agenda an active review of the current economic sanctions against Iran, as well as discussing security guarantees for Iran.\nI believe we shall advance in this area if we also remain true to our principle of safeguarding human rights. I appeal specifically to the Commission not to shelve the dialogue on human rights for the duration of the negotiations, but to intensify it. I very much regret having to say this, but I have learned that the German Government, the selfsame Government which is actively supporting our negotiations on the EU side, has instituted deportation proceedings against a 26-year-old woman who obtained a divorce from her Iranian husband and converted to Christianity. Deportation to Iran in these circumstances – and we have opposed it in two previous resolutions – exposes a woman to the danger of stoning, persecution or even death.\nI believe that such a bipolar policy makes it difficult, but we must manage to rally a majority in Europe behind a coherent human rights policy. That will establish our credibility on the Iran issue. I have no wish to see Iran succeed in playing off the Europeans against the Americans, because we both have the same objectives. I must re-emphasise that point.\nLet me also refer at this juncture to another issue where my group is in agreement with the President of the United States, namely the continuation of the embargo against China. If we say that the criterion of respect for human rights is fundamental to our European foreign policy, we must acknowledge that the human rights situation in China remains appalling, and it was for this reason that the House adopted a resolution only a few weeks ago in which it rejected the initiative launched by President Chirac and Chancellor Schröder. We expect this embargo to be maintained and reaffirm that economic interests must not take precedence over human rights."

      "english": "Markov (GUE/NGL), on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group . – (DE) Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, even though the subject of this debate is the Commission’s legislative and work programme for 2005, it must, of course, be seen in the wider strategic framework, which is strongly influenced by the Lisbon strategy and, regrettably, is designed primarily to intensify competition. To make matters worse, I believe it is also using the wrong means to pursue that goal.\nThe operating profits of the large conglomerates in the European Union increased by 78% in 2004. The ratio of profits to GDP is at what is nearly its highest level in the last 25 years. Over the past 12 months, another substantial surplus has been registered in the balance of trade and the balance of payments.\nEven in the Federal Republic of Germany, where the large companies are constantly bleating about being shackled by an uncompetitive location, 46 of the 50 companies listed in the Dax index clocked up staggering increases in their profits over the first three quarters.\nAt the same time, unemployment is rising. There are more and more debates on the introduction of longer working hours in various different forms. Employees are expected to practise wage restraint, which effectively amounts to a drop in real incomes. Welfare benefits are being cut or recipients’ contributions drastically increased, and schemes based on solidarity are increasingly being shunted towards dependence on private funding.\nThese actions are weakening demand instead of strengthening it. We regard this as a pernicious trend. Of course we need competition, but it must be compatible with the Gothenburg criteria, so as to minimise unemployment, maximise consumer protection and guarantee social security within a healthy environment, and so as to achieve social cohesion through solidarity and sustainable development.\nAccordingly, we must make the following pleas to the Commission: abandon your neo-liberal economic policies and scrap your directives on service provision in the single market as well as the Working Time Directive and present replacements in the form of directives on improved health and safety at work or on the harmonisation of welfare standards. Protect small and medium-sized enterprises by using the directives adopted by the last Parliament, such as the directive on software patents, as the basis for a new proposal. Together with the Council, amend the Stability Pact to make expenditure on education and training count as investment, thereby eliminating it from the calculation of the debt ratio. Strive for democratic and socially just world trade by trying to reform the WTO, and do not go to Hong Kong with the same ideas that the old Commission took to Cancún.\nDo not argue for more effective military options, but only for peaceful solutions. Campaign for better protection of the environment, and remember that there is certainly still work to be done here in the European Union in fields such as biodiversity, the avoidance and recycling of waste and the sustainable use of resources. Exert more influence in the struggle to protect the global climate, because not only the United States but also China, India and Brazil must be motivated to commit themselves more firmly to this effort.\nThis would be the right course for the European Union; it would promote sustainable development and create jobs. It is wrong to perpetuate and even intensify the pursuit of the old roads to nowhere that have long been discredited.",

Selbst wenn das Thema der Aussprache „Gesetzgebungs- und Arbeitsprogramm der Kommission für 2005“ lautet, lässt sich diese Debatte natürlich nur in einen gesamtstrategischen Rahmen einordnen, welcher durch die Lissabon-Strategie geprägt ist und leider vorrangig auf die Stärkung des Wettbewerbs zielt – und dies in meinen Augen auch noch mit den falschen Mitteln.\nDie operationellen Gewinne der Großkonzerne der Europäischen Union haben sich 2004 um 78 % gesteigert. Das Verhältnis zwischen Erlös und Bruttoinlandsprodukt ist fast an den höchsten Wert der letzten 25 Jahre herangerückt. Die Handels- und Währungsbilanzen sind in den letzten zwölf Monaten wieder von einem starken Plus gekennzeichnet.\nSelbst in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland, wo die großen Unternehmen permanent weinerlich erklären, sie hätten keine Chance im Standortwettbewerb, haben 46 der 50 im Dax geführten Unternehmen in den ersten drei Quartalen Gewinnzuwächse von ungeahnter Größe eingefahren.\nGleichzeitig steigt die Arbeitslosigkeit. Die Debatten um Verlängerung der Arbeitszeit, egal in welcher Form, nehmen zu. Von den Arbeitnehmern wird Lohnzurückhaltung gefordert, was in Wirklichkeit ein Absinken des Realeinkommens darstellt. Sozialleistungen werden gekürzt bzw. drastisch verteuert, solidarisch aufgebaute Systeme immer mehr in Richtung Privatfinanzierung verlagert.\nDieses Agieren führt nicht zur Stärkung, sondern zu einer Schwächung der Nachfrage. Diese Tendenz halten wir für falsch! Jawohl, wir benötigen Wettbewerb – aber in Einklang mit den Göteborg-Kriterien, um die geringstmögliche Arbeitslosigkeit, hohen Verbraucherschutz, soziale Sicherheit der Bürger in einer gesunden Umwelt, soziale Kohäsion durch Solidarität und nachhaltige Entwicklung zu erreichen.\nDeshalb können wir die Kommission nur auffordern: Stoppen Sie Ihre neoliberale Wirtschaftspolitik, ziehen Sie Ihre Richtlinien zu den Dienstleistungen im Binnenmarkt zurück, ebenso wie Ihre Arbeitszeitrichtlinie, und legen Sie stattdessen Richtlinien für verbesserten Arbeitsschutz oder für eine Harmonisierung von Sozialstandards vor! Schützen Sie den Klein- und Mittelstand, indem Sie die vom letzten Parlament verabschiedeten Richtlinien, z. B. für die Software-Patente, als Basis für einen neuen Vorschlag nehmen! Verändern Sie gemeinsam mit dem Rat den Stabilitätspakt, indem Ausgaben für Bildung und Ausbildung als Investition angerechnet und aus der Verschuldungsquote herausgerechnet werden! Setzen Sie sich für einen demokratischen und sozial gerechten Welthandel ein, indem Sie versuchen, die WTO zu reformieren und nach Hongkong nicht mit denselben Vorstellungen zu gehen, wie die alte Kommission dies in Cancún getan hat!\nSetzen Sie sich nicht für eine Stärkung der militärischen Optionen ein, sondern ausschließlich für friedliche Lösungen! Setzen Sie sich für höheren Umweltschutz ein, wobei auch hier innerhalb der Europäischen Union durchaus noch Nachholbedarf besteht, wie z. B. auf dem Gebiet der biologischen Vielfalt, der Vermeidung und Verarbeitung von Abfall und der nachhaltigen Nutzung der Ressourcen! Verstärken Sie Ihre Einflussnahme beim Klimaschutz, da sowohl die USA als auch China, Indien und Brasilien hier stärker eingebunden werden müssen!\nDies wäre der richtige Weg für die Europäische Union, und dies würde die nachhaltige Entwicklung fördern, und dies würde Arbeitsplätze schaffen – und nicht die Fortführung bzw. Verstärkung der alten, längst überholten Wege, die sich als falsch herausgestellt haben.",

      "english": "Ryan (UEN), on behalf of the UEN Group . – Madam President, the key challenge facing the European Union at this time is an economic one. The European Parliament, the European Commission and the EU governments are going to have to work together closely if the objectives of the Lisbon strategy are to be met. This will not be an easy task – we must not underestimate the challenges that lie ahead of us.\nOne of the issues that must be looked at most carefully relates to the regulatory framework in Europe – we need less regulation in Europe, not more. This was outlined very clearly in a report in today's Financial Times on a study by the Centre for the Study of Financial Innovation, which stated clearly that most people involved in banking and financial services believe that we have far too much regulation and that we need to tackle it so that business can become more competitive.\nThe key priorities for the European Union at this time include: the completion of the Financial Services Action Plan so as to guarantee a greater level of competition amongst the financial institutions operating within the 25 Member States of the EU, which includes ensuring that retail banking services are available to all EU citizens in the 25 Member States; facilitating the merging of European banks and the updating of asset management legislation so as to guarantee that fund managers can operate asset funds on a cross-border basis; the introduction of new legislation to reduce the costs of clearing and settling trading security transactions; and the introduction of greater competition in the insurance sector.\nThe European Union must promote a greater level of dialogue with America to streamline the rules governing the operating of the accountancy industry.

Your statement, Mr President, did not entirely satisfy me, because the question of services cannot be reduced to market economics.

Aber jeder, der Flexibilität will, weiß, dass Flexibilität und soziale Sicherheit – wie am nordischen Modell sichtbar – kein Widerspruch sind, sondern dass im Gegenteil die Bürgerinnen und Bürger sogar bereit sind, mehr Flexibilität zu akzeptieren, wenn es ein soziales Netz der Sicherheit gibt. Und wenn es z. B. auch massive Maßnahmen zur Weiterbildung gibt, die den Menschen helfen, diese Flexibilität auch sozial bewältigen zu können.\nWir brauchen aber auch funktionierende öffentliche Dienstleistungen. Da hat mich Ihre Aussage, Herr Präsident, nicht ganz befriedigt, denn die Frage der Dienstleistungen ist nicht nur etwas, was die Frage des Marktes betrifft. Unsere öffentlichen Dienstleistungen sind unsere eigene Identität – ob es die Post oder der Nahverkehr ist, sie gehören zur europäischen Identität und diese wollen die Bürgerinnen und Bürger auch entsprechend verteidigt haben. Daher ist es nicht nur eine ökonomische, sondern auch eine zutiefst emotionale Sache.\nZuletzt noch eine Bemerkung: Ich finde das, was die Vizepräsidentin Wallström vor kurzem mit den Flugpassagierrechten gemacht hat, sehr gut. Wir müssen nämlich an die Öffentlichkeit treten und das, was wir in diesem Parlament, auch auf Vorschlag der Kommission, erreichen, den Bürgerinnen und Bürgern vermitteln.

We have now seen the results from Spain, which put us all in a better position, not only as regards the referendum campaign but also by making it clear that a great nation has decided by a large majority in favour of this political project. We also have something to show tomorrow, when you see President Bush. It has become clear to all of us – and this must be reflected in our policies – that only joint action makes us a significant factor, and this action pays off, because I can find no other explanation for Condoleezza Rice’s comment that the European Constitution should be adopted. US policy, indeed, is sounding an entirely new note here. Allow me also to express my thanks to you, President Barroso, for your own particular role in enabling the President of this House to take part in tomorrow’s meeting.\nI should like to refer to another related point, namely our neighbourhood policy. I do not believe we have made enough progress in this direction, and President Yushchenko will be here in Parliament on Wednesday so that we can seek a new way to address the formidable challenge of cementing democracy in Eastern Europe, so that closer links can be forged between Eastern Europe and the European Union.

Hier haben wir auch einen Schritt für morgen, wenn Sie Präsident Bush sehen werden. Es ist uns allen klar geworden – und dies muss in unserer Politik zum Ausdruck kommen –, dass nur ein gemeinschaftliches Handeln uns zu einem Faktor macht. Und dieses Handeln ist wertvoll, denn anders kann ich es nicht verstehen, dass Condoleezza Rice erklärt hat, dass die Europäische Verfassung angenommen werden sollte. Dies ist auch ein völlig neuer Ton in der amerikanischen Politik. Gestatten Sie, Herr Präsident Barroso, dass ich mich auch noch einmal dafür bedanke, dass gerade Sie es mit möglich gemacht haben, dass unser Präsident morgen an den Treffen teilnehmen kann.\nIch möchte einen weiteren Punkt ansprechen, der damit zusammenhängt, nämlich die Frage der Nachbarschaftspolitik. Ich glaube, hier sind wir noch nicht ausreichend weit gekommen, und Präsident Juschtschenko wird am Mittwoch in diesem Parlament sein, damit wir einen neuen Weg zu dieser großartigen Herausforderung einer Demokratie in Osteuropa finden, damit wir Osteuropa zur Anbindung an die Europäische Union bringen. Das bedeutet, dass wir dringend mehr brauchen als die Nachbarschaftspolitik, weil sonst nur erhöhter Druck entsteht, zu schnell nur über Vollmitgliedschaft zu reden, die wir nicht sofort bewältigen können, weil dies zu einem Overstretching der Europäischen Union führen würde.\nWir müssen den Menschen in diesen Ländern eine Perspektive eröffnen, und deswegen ist es wirklich eine Überlegung wert, ob es nicht möglich ist, eine Option neben der Vollmitgliedschaft zu haben, die nicht ein Nein zur Vollmitgliedschaft bedeutet, sondern Perspektiven für später eröffnet, zugleich aber auch sofort etwas bringen kann, so wie dies in der Vergangenheit der Europäische Wirtschaftsraum war, aus dem Schweden, Finnland und Österreich in die Europäische Union gekommen sind.\nIch bitte die Kommission, hier wirklich eine Überlegung anzustellen, weil ich fürchte, dass wir ansonsten sehr schnell in eine schwierige Situation geraten.

There is absolutely no doubt that all the pillars are, in principle, equally important components of the strategy. On the other hand, it is a truism that proper social and environmental policies cannot be pursued without a functioning economy. The economy is, as it were, the key to the realisation of all our other good political intentions. Priorities must therefore be set accordingly, although the pillar structure must not be forgotten. I should perhaps mention in passing that there is no better social policy than the creation of jobs. That may be another truism, but it still needs to be said.\nAnother gentle reminder might be in order, because the President of the Commission is constantly being taken to task over this matter. Both of the competent Vice-Presidents of the European Commission – the one who signed the paper in Lisbon and the one who signed the programme we are discussing today – are Socialists. It is perhaps appropriate to reiterate that in passing. This should mean that the dossier is in the best hands within the Commission, and I fail to see the point of forever dredging up this discussion on alleged differences that do not even exist.\nI also have a particular appeal to make in this matter, which is that the Commission must attach high priority in the framework of this legislative programme, as in other areas, to the implementation of its interinstitutional agreement with the Council and Parliament. This is vitally important. Among the reasons why things have not worked as well as they should in the past have been the lack of impact assessments of legislative proposals and the inadequate way in which the consultation of stakeholders has been conducted.\nI urge the President and Vice-President of the Commission, particularly in the course of their work over the coming months, to ensure that the interinstitutional agreement is consistently implemented in this context. In many areas, this will be the key to the success to which they and all of us aspire.\n(Applause)",

Lassen Sie mich zu Beginn eine kurze Anmerkung zu den politischen Inhalten machen, die hier insbesondere vom Kollegen Schulz vorgetragen wurden.\nIch glaube – und das zeigt ja auch die Debatte die wir im Augenblick über die Lissabon-Strategie führen – dass die Lissabon-Strategie nun einmal mehrere Pfeiler hat. Es gibt gar keinen Zweifel, dass all diese Pfeiler vom Grundsatz her gleichberechtigt Bestandteil dieser Strategie sind. Aber auf der anderen Seite ist es eine Binsenweisheit, dass ohne eine funktionierende Wirtschaft auch keine vernünftige Sozialpolitik und keine vernünftige Umweltpolitik betrieben werden kann. Dies ist sozusagen die Voraussetzung dafür, dass man die anderen Wohltaten auch tatsächlich in der Politik umsetzen kann. Darum muss man die Prioritäten auch in der richtigen Reihenfolge setzen, ohne dabei die Säulen zu vergessen. Vielleicht noch am Rande bemerkt: Eine bessere Sozialpolitik als das Schaffen von Arbeitsplätzen gibt es nicht. Ich denke, dies ist auch eine Binsenwahrheit, die man an dieser Stelle einfach einmal aussprechen sollte.\nVielleicht noch ein anderer dezenter Hinweis, weil ja in diesem Zusammenhang immer wieder auf den Kommissionspräsidenten geschimpft wird. Die beiden verantwortlichen Vizepräsidenten der Europäischen Kommission, die sowohl das Papier in Lissabon als auch das Programm, über das wir heute hier beraten, mit unterzeichnet haben, sind Sozialisten. Vielleicht ist ein solcher Hinweis am Rande auch noch einmal angebracht. Von daher sollte das in der Kommission eigentlich in besten Händen sein, und ich verstehe gar nicht, was diese immer wieder hochgezogene Diskussion über angebliche Unterschiede, die es gar nicht gibt, eigentlich ausmacht.\nIch habe noch ein besonderes Anliegen in diesem Zusammenhang, und das ist, dass die Kommission auch im Rahmen dieses Gesetzgebungsprogramms besondere Priorität auf die Umsetzung der interinstitutionellen Vereinbarung mit Rat und Parlament legen muss. Dies ist von entscheidender Bedeutung! Einer der Gründe, warum die Dinge in der Vergangenheit nicht so funktioniert haben, wie sie funktionieren sollten, ist der Mangel an impact assessment, an Gesetzesfolgenabschätzung, gewesen, und die unzureichende Art und Weise, in der die Konsultation von stake holders durchgeführt worden ist.\nIch bitte Sie, Herr Kommissionspräsident, und Sie, Frau Kommissionsvizepräsidentin, insbesondere auch in Ihrer Arbeit in den nächsten Monaten darauf zu achten, dass die interinstitutionelle Vereinbarung diesbezüglich konsequent umgesetzt wird. Damit steht und fällt in vielen Bereichen auch der Erfolg, den Sie und wir alle gemeinsam haben wollen.\n(Beifall)",

There is absolutely no doubt that all the pillars are, in principle, equally important components of the strategy. On the other hand, it is a truism that proper social and environmental policies cannot be pursued without a functioning economy. The economy is, as it were, the key to the realisation of all our other good political intentions. Priorities must therefore be set accordingly, although the pillar structure must not be forgotten. I should perhaps mention in passing that there is no better social policy than the creation of jobs. That may be another truism, but it still needs to be said.\nAnother gentle reminder might be in order, because the President of the Commission is constantly being taken to task over this matter. Both of the competent Vice-Presidents of the European Commission – the one who signed the paper in Lisbon and the one who signed the programme we are discussing today – are Socialists. It is perhaps appropriate to reiterate that in passing. This should mean that the dossier is in the best hands within the Commission, and I fail to see the point of forever dredging up this discussion on alleged differences that do not even exist.\nI also have a particular appeal to make in this matter, which is that the Commission must attach high priority in the framework of this legislative programme, as in other areas, to the implementation of its interinstitutional agreement with the Council and Parliament. This is vitally important. Among the reasons why things have not worked as well as they should in the past have been the lack of impact assessments of legislative proposals and the inadequate way in which the consultation of stakeholders has been conducted.\nI urge the President and Vice-President of the Commission, particularly in the course of their work over the coming months, to ensure that the interinstitutional agreement is consistently implemented in this context. In many areas, this will be the key to the success to which they and all of us aspire.\n(Applause)"

Cabe agora aos Estados-Membros a responsabilidade de concretizarem o ímpeto reformador proposto pela Comissão através de acções políticas concretas.\nEstamos perante a absoluta necessidade de proceder a reformas que, na maior parte dos casos, não são simpáticas para a opinião pública, mas são aquelas que a Europa precisa.

We need more optimism and confidence, more serious intent, more clarity and scrutiny and the political will to honour the pledges we make from our soap boxes. We need more leadership – more leadership from political circles, more leadership from those in government and more leadership from the Commission.\nI should also like to appeal to everyone here to reflect a little. All of us are here to make the four freedoms a reality in law and in fact, and everything that serves this purpose is good politics. We must reflect on what we have enshrined in the Constitution. I really do not understand why we are arguing about these things today. In the Constitution, we proclaim the principle of a social market economy. In so doing, we are clearly stating that the market is not an end in itself but a means to an end, that we need an efficient market which fulfils its social and environmental responsibilities. We have set ourselves the aim of full employment, and we have set ourselves the aim of sustainability.

Wenn ich mir die Debatte so anhöre, dann muss ich wiederholen, dass wir eine stärkere Europäisierung des Denkens benötigen und nicht mehr nationalisieren oder parteipolitisieren sollten. Wir benötigen mehr Optimismus und Vertrauen, Ernsthaftigkeit und Klarheit, Überprüfbarkeit und den politischen Willen, das umzusetzen, wozu wir uns in Sonntagsreden laufend verpflichten. Wir benötigen mehr leadership , mehr leadership der politisch Handelnden, mehr leaderhip der Regierenden, mehr leadership der Kommission.\nIch möchte dazu aufrufen, dass wir uns ein bisschen besinnen. Wir alle sind hier, um die vier Freiheiten umzusetzen und zu verwirklichen. Und alles, was der Umsetzung der vier Freiheiten dient, ist richtige Politik. Wir haben uns darauf zu besinnen, was wir mit der Verfassung beschlossen haben. Ich verstehe heute die Auseinandersetzung eigentlich nicht. In der Verfassung steht: Wir bekennen uns zur sozialen Marktwirtschaft. Wir sagen damit deutlich, dass der Markt nicht Selbstzweck ist, sondern Mittel zum Zweck, dass wir einen effizienten Markt benötigen, der seiner sozialen und ökologischen Verantwortung gerecht wird. Wir haben uns als Ziel die Vollbeschäftigung gesetzt, wir haben uns als Ziel die Nachhaltigkeit gesetzt. Warum vermitteln wir hier den Bürgern laufend den Eindruck, als würden wir das eine gegen das andere ausspielen?\nWir wollen nicht mehr tagespolitischen Populismus, sondern wir wollen eine stärkere Verantwortung gegenüber der Zukunft. Und daher sage ich Ihnen, Herr Kommissionspräsident, machen Sie vor jedem Vorschlag die Subsidiaritätsprüfung! Legen Sie dem Bürger dar, welchen Mehrwert die europäische Regelung hat! Definieren Sie den Mehrwert für Wachstum, Wettbewerb und Beschäftigung! Definieren Sie die betroffene Zielgruppe! Machen Sie die Motive, die Ziele und die Auswirkungen klar und sagen Sie, wer was bis wann zu tun hat, damit wir unserer parlamentarischen Kontrolle gerecht werden können!",

We need more leadership – more leadership from political circles, more leadership from those in government and more leadership from the Commission.\nI should also like to appeal to everyone here to reflect a little. All of us are here to make the four freedoms a reality in law and in fact, and everything that serves this purpose is good politics. We must reflect on what we have enshrined in the Constitution. I really do not understand why we are arguing about these things today. In the Constitution, we proclaim the principle of a social market economy. In so doing, we are clearly stating that the market is not an end in itself but a means to an end, that we need an efficient market which fulfils its social and environmental responsibilities. We have set ourselves the aim of full employment, and we have set ourselves the aim of sustainability.

Yet if we want Europe to be effective, if we want Europe to be closer to its citizens and if we wish to achieve the objectives, then we must act much more effectively than hitherto ourselves. An important part of the European Union’s effectiveness is its administrative systems, its public administration. You mention them in the strategic objectives on page four, Mr President. This is very pleasing. Yet at the same time I recall that the Prodi Commission began the reform of public administration in the European Union. Former Commissioner Kinnock was responsible for this. While I am unaware of how the whole thing ended, if indeed it was ever started, the fact remains that the citizens of the European Union see this as a great bureaucratic apparatus, removed from the people, an apparatus which costs a great deal and which requires an extremely large amount of administration for every trifling thing, not to mention major projects. So all of us together, not just those of us here in the European Parliament, but also our electorates, justifiably expect the new Commission to find, within the framework of the priority tasks you have set out, the energy, time and will to deal with its own administrative system, with its own bureaucracy.

(MT) Mr President, allow me to congratulate Mr Barroso, the President of the Commission, on the legislative programme of the Commission and on the programme he has presented. Europe today has grown to consist of 25 Member States, and I am one of those Members who come from one of the countries most recently added to it by enlargement. Europe is what it rightly should be; a Europe with a significant voice in global decision-making processes, and we must maintain this role by continuing to reinforce the foundations once laid by Schuman, De Gasperi and Monnet, based on principles that have enabled the European Union to come as far as it has today. The work that the European Union performs must constantly reflect the principles of subsidiarity and solidarity.\nIt is vitally important that economic growth be equally spread around all European regions. Europe is obliged to help those who for some reason have lagged behind to catch up and expand their economies. A strong economy can be created by closer cooperation between the Member States, and this is where I would like to congratulate the Commission on the implementation of a new economic strategy that aims to create over six million jobs. The Lisbon Strategy must be an absolute priority for all of us who work in the European institutions.\nWe must be able to translate this strategy into work and prosperity, a goal that can be achieved only if we manage to eliminate excess bureaucracy and create a strong business environment. We in this House must encourage initiatives that will create work across our continent. Europe’s citizens expect us to improve Europe’s standard of living, and so we must do our best. The legislative and work programme that was presented gives a clear indication of the Commission’s vision for the coming years and, if it cooperates closely with Parliament, I think we can translate this new programme into benefits for all European citizens."

      "english": "Barroso, President of the Commission. (FR) Mr President, I will try to reply to some specific questions and then I would like to deal with a more general issue of policy, which I believe to be important in terms of our future work.\nWith regard to the specific issues, first of all, Mr Duff, you told me that you had not properly understood, or not appreciated, a comment apparently attributed to me concerning naïve federalism. I would very much like to clarify what I said, because it may not have been clear in the context. When I criticise naïve federalism, it is not in fact federalism itself that I am criticising; quite the opposite. I have great respect for all the federalists, all the men and women who founded our great European project. I still believe, moreover, that the federal method is essential to this Europe of ours. Furthermore, the community method, or at least the method we generally describe as such, is a kind of federal method. So, in reality, I criticised naïve federalism as contrasted with what I might consider to be a more sophisticated and more intelligent form of federalism, that is to say, an approach that does not seek to build our European Union – an increasingly close union between all Europeans, at the expense of the legitimacy of the democratic states. Our countries are, in fact, democratic states with democratic governments and democratic parliaments. I have had the honour of working in Geneva with a great federalist, Denis de Rougemont, who sometimes blamed the state for all evils, as if the state were not also a democratic institution. I am in favour of an increasingly strong Union, but that strengthening should not jeopardise the legitimacy of the democratic states. I very much wish to offer that clarification because I have heard criticisms of my comment, which gave a distorted view of my thoughts and feelings on the subject of Europe.\nThe second issue relates to security and justice. We have talked a lot about the economy, but we must not forget that we have a programme – and a very ambitious one at that – in the field of security and justice – a programme that will be implemented by Vice-President Frattini. That, specifically, was the subject of one of the questions raised. Security, justice and the protection of fundamental rights will be one of the Commission's priorities. We need to offer a practical response to people’s demands in terms of security. That is why, in 2005, we are, in particular, going to present Parliament with the action plan aimed at implementing the strategy adopted in The Hague, in the form of proposals concerning the protection of the victims of organised crime, women and children in particular. I would draw your attention to the fact that this is a new dimension to the action described in our programme: placing more emphasis on the protection of children. We believe – and I also very much want to stress this – that this is a field in which it is possible to strengthen action at European level. Proposals can thus be presented with a view to strengthening mutual recognition and trust between the judicial authorities, and a proposal concerning a European strategy in relation to legal immigration and to the fight against people traffickers can be drawn up. Security, justice and the protection of human rights are a genuine priority, and I would like you to know that the Commission is going to do everything possible to respond to those demands.\nCertain Members, including Mr Karas, Mr Kirkhope, and Mr Lehne, and also Mr Goebbels to a certain degree, have raised the issue of how to focus legislation and of whether it should be strengthened or restricted. I am delighted, moreover, that the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council are fully aware of this concern. When I talk about ‘better legislation’, I do not always mean that we need less legislation. In certain cases, precisely because we are a Union, we need a degree of harmonisation or more legislation, sometimes in order to harmonise or simplify the existing legislation. I would, however, like to stress that we do share this concern about the quality of legislation, and we have introduced it into our programme. Throughout all of the action we take, we shall, therefore, be weighing up the factors of cost, proportionality and subsidiarity that we shall be using for the purposes of impact assessment.\nThis is why – and I say this partly in response to Mr Goebbels – we have of course had to draw up a list of our main objectives. This is an implementation programme for this year. You would no doubt criticise us if I only presented four or five priorities. The political line is one dimension and, in this regard, we are talking about very clear and well-focussed priorities, defined when we presented the strategic objectives. The specific, legislative and implementation programme is another dimension, and one of which you should be aware so that you can monitor our activities, the Commission being answerable to this Parliament.\nWith regard to another specific question, namely climate change, I would like very much to say to Mrs Beer, who I am sure will put this question to President Bush tomorrow, that one of the subjects on our agenda is the possibility of cooperation with the Americans, partly in a post-Kyoto spirit. That is a sensitive subject. We are aware of the positions taken by the American administration to date, but I believe we should embark upon a dialogue on this issue with the United States of America. I shall probably have the opportunity to raise this issue with the President of the United States.\nWith regard, now, to the issue of the Directive on Services, I would very much like to say, in response specifically to Mr Swoboda, that I agree with your concerns about services of general interest. I have already said this on many occasions: services of general interest, or certain public services, are part of what might be called the tradition, or organisational culture, of certain states. We are therefore seeking specifically to ensure that these concerns are taken into account, since we believe them to be legitimate.\nThat is why my Commission has taken the initiative to review certain aspects of the Directive on Services, and I was expecting a word of congratulation from yourselves. It is exactly the opposite that I hear from you when you describe this Commission as neoliberal even though it was not this Commission that presented the directive in question. In fact, we are seeking a balance while maintaining the objective, which is to create a genuine internal market in services, since that is essential to the creation of jobs in Europe. This is an objective we cannot abandon and on which, furthermore, there is consensus until 2010, but it must be pursued in a balanced manner. That is the fundamental political question I would like to put to our friends in the Socialist Party in the European Parliament, and in particular to Mr Schultz, who raised this question.\nYou must choose: either you want to oppose the Commission or you want to work with it. I have already said that the Commission wants to work in a spirit of cooperation and constructive rapport with Parliament and, in particular, with all those Members who truly want to move Europe forward. This is no neoliberal proposal on our part.\nThe proposals I have put forward in this House are the result of a consensus. The Commission includes Christian Democrats, Socialists and Liberals. The Lisbon Agenda was presented to the Commission by myself and Vice-President Verheugen, who is a member of your political grouping. The programme I have just presented today has been presented by myself and Vice-President Wallström, who is also a member of your political grouping.\nWe do not want to engage in dogmatism; we want to unite those Europeans who want reforms for Europe, but we do not want to abandon the reforms. If it has been possible for the Commission to take all these decisions unanimously, although there may have been expressed differences; if Christian Democrats, Socialists, Liberals and Independents have reached a consensus, why might we not also achieve that here in the European Parliament and unite around an ambitious programme of reform for this Europe of ours, which takes account of social and environmental concerns? Do not present a caricature of our Commission. That is not fair.\n(Applause)\nIf you look at the list of our objectives, you will find that it contains a series of specific proposals in the social and environmental fields. We are well aware that, today, it is impossible to create growth without an environmental dimension. On the contrary, we believe that the environment contributes to growth and increased competitiveness in Europe. We agree on this point, so please do not see obstacles where there are, in fact, none. What we want is to make it clear that the status quo is no longer an option today, that Europe has serious competitiveness problems when compared to other regions of the world and that we intend to put this right by adapting and renewing our social model. That is why the Commission has a President who wants reform, but also Socialist, Liberal, Christian Democrat and Independent members who all also want this reform to be carried out in a spirit of balance and proportion.\nI would therefore like to ask the PSE Group not to set itself up in opposition to the Commission: on the contrary, I would ask it to cooperate, though not in an uncritical way, with us, just as all the other groups do. Mrs Grossetête, who is a member of the largest political grouping in the European Parliament, has also expressed to us certain demands and requirements, and I thank her for that.\nI would now like to draw your attention, as fellow Europeans, to the fact that this is not just any moment in the history of Europe. Yesterday, we learned the result of the referendum in Spain, and we are delighted about this, but we shall also have a referendum in France. We shall have a referendum in the United Kingdom; I talked about it today with Prime Minister Blair in London. What do you believe Europeans expect now? They want the institutions to work together; they do not have a very good understanding of the fine details of the debate or of the policies of the political groups. They want to know whether the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council are working along the same lines and whether or not they are genuinely concerned about their problems.\nI believe it would be highly inappropriate, at a time like this when very important referendums are taking place, for people to look at Europe and see, on the one hand, the Commission and, on the other, a number of large groups such as your great European Socialist grouping, and thus to be presented with an image of division. I have already addressed this very sincere appeal to some of you personally and I would like to repeat it. We should not abandon our ideas, of course, since we are all very attached to them, but it is possible to look beyond these ideas and reach a dynamic consensus in favour of the reforms Europe needs. I believe that this is genuinely possible.\n(Applause)\nThe last issue relates to the criticism you expressed, Mr Schultz, of the statement I made about my country. As, moreover, you acknowledged, I did not, where this matter was concerned, fail to honour any obligation, because the Commission's code of conduct clearly allows Commissioners to be active members of political parties and unions. There was therefore no failure to honour obligations. All I did was express my solidarity with the party of which I was President for several years. What would have been a real political event in my country is if I had kept quiet! I would therefore thank you for not putting the question in the form of an attack against me personally for the position I took, because it was perfectly permissible for me to take that position.\nYou raised the possibility of the code of conduct’s being revised in terms of the interinstitutional agreement. I would very much like to say that I am completely opposed to this idea, since our code of conduct stipulates that the members of the Commission may participate in an election campaign if they request authorisation to do so from the President of the Commission. The question you raised is therefore about what happens in the case of the President of the Commission. I must state that if the President of the Commission has the power to decide whether or not Commissioners can participate, then he also has that power in relation to himself. This is clearly laid down in the Treaty, Article 217 of which states, and I shall read it in English:\nThe members of the Commission shall carry out duties devolved upon them by the President under his authority.\n(FR) The Treaty therefore clearly establishes the principle of the President's political leadership of the College and the principle of the President's authority. So to accept, by means of an interinstitutional agreement, a reduction in the authority of the President would be contrary to the Treaty as it stands, and to weaken the President of the Commission's authority would mean weakening the authority of the Commission itself.\nWe need a strong Commission. That is why I believe that your proposal is not a good one. I would draw the attention of all the political families to the fact that we, the European Parliament and the Commission, must strengthen each other on a mutual basis. We are the European institutions par excellence . We can do extraordinary things together, and we must therefore enhance each other’s status. Personally, I try to enhance the status of the European Parliament in all my public statements, and not just in my statements. I would expect you to do the same, since we have great challenges to face together, and together we can win the day. However, we cannot do so by reducing the importance of the Commission and by asking the Commissioners to be civil servants. Instead, we must ask them to assume their political responsibilities, to exercise their citizenship and to express their preferences, always while working in a European spirit of course. As a citizen, I have the right to express my point of view about my own country. I have the right, like all European citizens, to vote in accordance with my opinions.\nAs President of the Commission, I will not discriminate. In fact, at your request, I received the leader of the opposition, who will become the Prime Minister of my country. I received him a few days before the beginning of the election campaign, because, as President of the Commission, I do not use my post to oppose any particular government and I do not distinguish between governments of the left and of the right. In fact, I believe that the Commission should represent the general European interest.\nHaving said that, the members of the Commission are political men and women. Perhaps some Members of this House do not like that. As citizens, we have rights, however. We have the right to express ourselves, and that is a fundamental right. That is why I do not accept your criticism in this regard. I would like to point out that we all need strong European institutions. This institution – the Commission – must be strong and must work with a strong Parliament, firmly committed to change and reforms and with the sense of balance that is at the heart of our Europe.\n(Applause)",

      "formatted_summary": "Barroso, President of the Commission. (FR) Mr President, I will try to reply to some specific questions and then I would like to deal with a more general issue of policy, which I believe to be important in terms of our future work.\nWith regard to the specific issues, first of all, Mr Duff, you told me that you had not properly understood, or not appreciated, a comment apparently attributed to me concerning naïve federalism. I would very much like to clarify what I said, because it may not have been clear in the context. When I criticise naïve federalism, it is not in fact federalism itself that I am criticising; quite the opposite. I have great respect for all the federalists, all the men and women who founded our great European project. I still believe, moreover, that the federal method is essential to this Europe of ours. Furthermore, the community method, or at least the method we generally describe as such, is a kind of federal method. So, in reality, I criticised naïve federalism as contrasted with what I might consider to be a more sophisticated and more intelligent form of federalism, that is to say, an approach that does not seek to build our European Union – an increasingly close union between all Europeans, at the expense of the legitimacy of the democratic states. Our countries are, in fact, democratic states with democratic governments and democratic parliaments. I have had the honour of working in Geneva with a great federalist, Denis de Rougemont, who sometimes blamed the state for all evils, as if the state were not also a democratic institution. I am in favour of an increasingly strong Union, but that strengthening should not jeopardise the legitimacy of the democratic states. I very much wish to offer that clarification because I have heard criticisms of my comment, which gave a distorted view of my thoughts and feelings on the subject of Europe.\nThe second issue relates to security and justice. We have talked a lot about the economy, but we must not forget that we have a programme – and a very ambitious one at that – in the field of security and justice – a programme that will be implemented by Vice-President Frattini. That, specifically, was the subject of one of the questions raised. Security, justice and the protection of fundamental rights will be one of the Commission's priorities. We need to offer a practical response to people’s demands in terms of security. That is why, in 2005, we are, in particular, going to present Parliament with the action plan aimed at implementing the strategy adopted in The Hague, in the form of proposals concerning the protection of the victims of organised crime, women and children in particular. I would draw your attention to the fact that this is a new dimension to the action described in our programme: placing more emphasis on the protection of children. We believe – and I also very much want to stress this – that this is a field in which it is possible to strengthen action at European level. Proposals can thus be presented with a view to strengthening mutual recognition and trust between the judicial authorities, and a proposal concerning a European strategy in relation to legal immigration and to the fight against people traffickers can be drawn up. Security, justice and the protection of human rights are a genuine priority, and I would like you to know that the Commission is going to do everything possible to respond to those demands.\nCertain Members, including Mr Karas, Mr Kirkhope, and Mr Lehne, and also Mr Goebbels to a certain degree, have raised the issue of how to focus legislation and of whether it should be strengthened or restricted. I am delighted, moreover, that the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council are fully aware of this concern. When I talk about ‘better legislation’, I do not always mean that we need less legislation. In certain cases, precisely because we are a Union, we need a degree of harmonisation or more legislation, sometimes in order to harmonise or simplify the existing legislation. I would, however, like to stress that we do share this concern about the quality of legislation, and we have introduced it into our programme. Throughout all of the action we take, we shall, therefore, be weighing up the factors of cost, proportionality and subsidiarity that we shall be using for the purposes of impact assessment.\nThis is why – and I say this partly in response to Mr Goebbels – we have of course had to draw up a list of our main objectives. This is an implementation programme for this year. You would no doubt criticise us if I only presented four or five priorities. The political line is one dimension and, in this regard, we are talking about very clear and well-focussed priorities, defined when we presented the strategic objectives. The specific, legislative and implementation programme is another dimension, and one of which you should be aware so that you can monitor our activities, the Commission being answerable to this Parliament.\nWith regard to another specific question, namely climate change, I would like very much to say to Mrs Beer, who I am sure will put this question to President Bush tomorrow, that one of the subjects on our agenda is the possibility of cooperation with the Americans, partly in a post-Kyoto spirit. That is a sensitive subject. We are aware of the positions taken by the American administration to date, but I believe we should embark upon a dialogue on this issue with the United States of America. I shall probably have the opportunity to raise this issue with the President of the United States.\nWith regard, now, to the issue of the Directive on Services, I would very much like to say, in response specifically to Mr Swoboda, that I agree with your concerns about services of general interest. I have already said this on many occasions: services of general interest, or certain public services, are part of what might be called the tradition, or organisational culture, of certain states. We are therefore seeking specifically to ensure that these concerns are taken into account, since we believe them to be legitimate.\nThat is why my Commission has taken the initiative to review certain aspects of the Directive on Services, and I was expecting a word of congratulation from yourselves. It is exactly the opposite that I hear from you when you describe this Commission as neoliberal even though it was not this Commission that presented the directive in question. In fact, we are seeking a balance while maintaining the objective, which is to create a genuine internal market in services, since that is essential to the creation of jobs in Europe. This is an objective we cannot abandon and on which, furthermore, there is consensus until 2010, but it must be pursued in a balanced manner. That is the fundamental political question I would like to put to our friends in the Socialist Party in the European Parliament, and in particular to Mr Schultz, who raised this question.\nYou must choose: either you want to oppose the Commission or you want to work with it. I have already said that the Commission wants to work in a spirit of cooperation and constructive rapport with Parliament and, in particular, with all those Members who truly want to move Europe forward. This is no neoliberal proposal on our part.\nThe proposals I have put forward in this House are the result of a consensus. The Commission includes Christian Democrats, Socialists and Liberals. The Lisbon Agenda was presented to the Commission by myself and Vice-President Verheugen, who is a member of your political grouping. The programme I have just presented today has been presented by myself and Vice-President Wallström, who is also a member of your political grouping.\nWe do not want to engage in dogmatism; we want to unite those Europeans who want reforms for Europe, but we do not want to abandon the reforms. If it has been possible for the Commission to take all these decisions unanimously, although there may have been expressed differences; if Christian Democrats, Socialists, Liberals and Independents have reached a consensus, why might we not also achieve that here in the European Parliament and unite around an ambitious programme of reform for this Europe of ours, which takes account of social and environmental concerns? Do not present a caricature of our Commission. That is not fair.\n(Applause)\nIf you look at the list of our objectives, you will find that it contains a series of specific proposals in the social and environmental fields. We are well aware that, today, it is impossible to create growth without an environmental dimension. On the contrary, we believe that the environment contributes to growth and increased competitiveness in Europe. We agree on this point, so please do not see obstacles where there are, in fact, none. What we want is to make it clear that the status quo is no longer an option today, that Europe has serious competitiveness problems when compared to other regions of the world and that we intend to put this right by adapting and renewing our social model. That is why the Commission has a President who wants reform, but also Socialist, Liberal, Christian Democrat and Independent members who all also want this reform to be carried out in a spirit of balance and proportion.\nI would therefore like to ask the PSE Group not to set itself up in opposition to the Commission: on the contrary, I would ask it to cooperate, though not in an uncritical way, with us, just as all the other groups do. Mrs Grossetête, who is a member of the largest political grouping in the European Parliament, has also expressed to us certain demands and requirements, and I thank her for that.\nI would now like to draw your attention, as fellow Europeans, to the fact that this is not just any moment in the history of Europe. Yesterday, we learned the result of the referendum in Spain, and we are delighted about this, but we shall also have a referendum in France. We shall have a referendum in the United Kingdom; I talked about it today with Prime Minister Blair in London. What do you believe Europeans expect now? They want the institutions to work together; they do not have a very good understanding of the fine details of the debate or of the policies of the political groups. They want to know whether the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council are working along the same lines and whether or not they are genuinely concerned about their problems.\nI believe it would be highly inappropriate, at a time like this when very important referendums are taking place, for people to look at Europe and see, on the one hand, the Commission and, on the other, a number of large groups such as your great European Socialist grouping, and thus to be presented with an image of division. I have already addressed this very sincere appeal to some of you personally and I would like to repeat it. We should not abandon our ideas, of course, since we are all very attached to them, but it is possible to look beyond these ideas and reach a dynamic consensus in favour of the reforms Europe needs. I believe that this is genuinely possible.\n(Applause)\nThe last issue relates to the criticism you expressed, Mr Schultz, of the statement I made about my country. As, moreover, you acknowledged, I did not, where this matter was concerned, fail to honour any obligation, because the Commission's code of conduct clearly allows Commissioners to be active members of political parties and unions. There was therefore no failure to honour obligations. All I did was express my solidarity with the party of which I was President for several years. What would have been a real political event in my country is if I had kept quiet! I would therefore thank you for not putting the question in the form of an attack against me personally for the position I took, because it was perfectly permissible for me to take that position.\nYou raised the possibility of the code of conduct’s being revised in terms of the interinstitutional agreement. I would very much like to say that I am completely opposed to this idea, since our code of conduct stipulates that the members of the Commission may participate in an election campaign if they request authorisation to do so from the President of the Commission. The question you raised is therefore about what happens in the case of the President of the Commission. I must state that if the President of the Commission has the power to decide whether or not Commissioners can participate, then he also has that power in relation to himself. This is clearly laid down in the Treaty, Article 217 of which states, and I shall read it in English:\nThe members of the Commission shall carry out duties devolved upon them by the President under his authority.\n(FR) The Treaty therefore clearly establishes the principle of the President's political leadership of the College and the principle of the President's authority. So to accept, by means of an interinstitutional agreement, a reduction in the authority of the President would be contrary to the Treaty as it stands, and to weaken the President of the Commission's authority would mean weakening the authority of the Commission itself.\nWe need a strong Commission. That is why I believe that your proposal is not a good one. I would draw the attention of all the political families to the fact that we, the European Parliament and the Commission, must strengthen each other on a mutual basis. We are the European institutions par excellence . We can do extraordinary things together, and we must therefore enhance each other’s status. Personally, I try to enhance the status of the European Parliament in all my public statements, and not just in my statements. I would expect you to do the same, since we have great challenges to face together, and together we can win the day. However, we cannot do so by reducing the importance of the Commission and by asking the Commissioners to be civil servants. Instead, we must ask them to assume their political responsibilities, to exercise their citizenship and to express their preferences, always while working in a European spirit of course. As a citizen, I have the right to express my point of view about my own country. I have the right, like all European citizens, to vote in accordance with my opinions.\nAs President of the Commission, I will not discriminate. In fact, at your request, I received the leader of the opposition, who will become the Prime Minister of my country. I received him a few days before the beginning of the election campaign, because, as President of the Commission, I do not use my post to oppose any particular government and I do not distinguish between governments of the left and of the right. In fact, I believe that the Commission should represent the general European interest.\nHaving said that, the members of the Commission are political men and women. Perhaps some Members of this House do not like that. As citizens, we have rights, however. We have the right to express ourselves, and that is a fundamental right. That is why I do not accept your criticism in this regard. I would like to point out that we all need strong European institutions. This institution – the Commission – must be strong and must work with a strong Parliament, firmly committed to change and reforms and with the sense of balance that is at the heart of our Europe.\n(Applause)"

  "summary": "# Executive Summary: Commission Legislative and Work Programme (2005) Parliamentary Debate\n\n## 1. Debate Information\n\n**Date:** February 21, 2005  \n**Topic:** Commission legislative and work programme (2005) (continuation of debate)  \n**Number of Contributions:** 19 substantive contributions from MEPs and Commission President Barroso  \n**Context:** Debate continuation from Brussels on January 26, 2005, examining the European Commission's 2005 work programme\n\n## 2. Executive Summary\n\nThe debate revealed significant political divisions over the Commission's approach to economic policy, social cohesion, and the balance between market liberalization and social protection. The discussion took place against the backdrop of Spain's successful referendum on the European Constitution and upcoming referendums in other member states.\n\n### Commission's Position (Barroso)\n\nPresident Barroso presented the Commission's 2005 programme built around three strategic pillars: prosperity, solidarity, and security. He celebrated Spain's constitutional referendum success, stating \"The Spanish people have said yes to the European Constitution, a clear and resounding yes\" [Barroso, 2005-02-21]. \n\nBarroso defended the Commission's balanced approach, emphasizing that it includes representatives from across the political spectrum. He argued that \"competitiveness and social cohesion need to go hand in hand\" and stressed that \"without solidarity, we can never be united\" [Barroso, 2005-02-21]. On the contentious Services Directive, he acknowledged concerns while maintaining the objective of completing the single market by 2010.\n\nThe Commission President firmly rejected criticism of his political activities in Portugal, asserting his rights as a citizen while defending the Commission's institutional authority. He concluded with an appeal for cooperation: \"You must choose: either you want to oppose the Commission or you want to work with it\" [Barroso, 2005-02-21].\n\n### Socialist Group (PSE) - Critical Opposition\n\nThe Socialist MEPs, led by Martin Schulz, mounted the strongest criticism of the Commission's approach. Schulz accused Barroso of inconsistent messaging, noting contradictions between parliamentary statements and media interviews. He demanded: \"Social coherence is in the front seat – at least for us Socialists, Mr President – and we shall not release you from your obligations on this score\" [Schulz, 2005-02-21].\n\nSocialist speakers consistently argued that economic policies must not undermine social protection. Swoboda emphasized that \"flexibility and social security are not mutually exclusive\" and called for defending public services as part of European identity [Swoboda, 2005-02-21]. The group's position was that \"if we do not make it clear to the public that this Union of ours offers them social security...the risks we incur will outweigh the opportunities we create\" [Schulz, 2005-02-21].\n\n### Conservative Groups (PPE-DE) - Market-Focused Support\n\nThe European People's Party strongly supported the Commission's economic priorities. Grossetête praised Barroso's responsiveness to parliamentary concerns, arguing that \"environmental considerations are not constraints or obstacles. They are assets and present an opportunity for our economy\" [Grossetête, 2005-02-21]. However, she warned that \"Member States cannot ask more of Europe while giving less\" [Grossetête, 2005-02-21].\n\nKirkhope was more critical of Socialist positions, arguing that \"high unemployment in so many parts of Europe is caused by the very outmoded proposals that they cling on to in economic terms\" [Kirkhope, 2005-02-21]. The conservative position emphasized that economic growth was essential for social progress, with Silva Peneda stating that \"jobs are created in companies\" requiring investment-friendly environments [Silva Peneda, 2005-02-21].\n\n### Liberal Group (ALDE) - Pragmatic Support\n\nAndrew Duff of the Liberal group supported the programme while calling for greater prioritization. He criticized Socialist positions as unrealistic: \"It is bizarre that socialists believe that there can be social progress without economic growth and structural reform\" [Duff, 2005-02-21]. The Liberals prioritized completing the single market, especially in financial services.\n\n### Green Group - International Focus\n\nThe Green representative, Beer, focused primarily on foreign policy concerns, particularly EU-US cooperation on Iran and maintaining the arms embargo against China. Beer argued for balancing security concerns with human rights: \"I appeal specifically to the Commission not to shelve the dialogue on human rights for the duration of the negotiations, but to intensify it\" [Beer, 2005-02-21].\n\n### Left Group (GUE/NGL) - Fundamental Opposition\n\nMarkov delivered the most comprehensive critique of the Commission's economic approach, arguing that despite corporate profits increasing by 78% in 2004, unemployment was rising. The Left group demanded abandoning \"neo-liberal economic policies\" and called for policies that would \"promote sustainable development and create jobs\" [Markov, 2005-02-21].\n\n### Key Areas of Contention\n\n**Services Directive:** Socialists and Left groups expressed strong concerns about potential negative impacts on public services and worker protections, while conservatives and liberals supported market completion objectives.\n\n**Economic vs. Social Priorities:** The fundamental disagreement centered on whether economic growth should take precedence over social protection or whether they must be pursued simultaneously with equal weight.\n\n**Regulatory Approach:** Multiple speakers called for \"better regulation\" and reduced bureaucracy, though they disagreed on specific applications, particularly regarding REACH chemical regulations.\n\n**New Member State Concerns:** Representatives from new member states emphasized the need for non-discrimination and equal access to structural funds and solidarity policies.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe debate revealed deep ideological divisions about Europe's future direction, with the Commission attempting to maintain a centrist position while facing criticism from both left and right. The timing, coinciding with constitutional referendums, added urgency to calls for institutional cooperation despite policy disagreements. Barroso's final appeal emphasized that \"this is not just any moment in the history of Europe\" and called for unity during the critical referendum period [Barroso, 2005-02-21].",
