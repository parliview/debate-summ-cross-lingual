The user provided a detailed parliamentary debate summary about rural development strategies and asked for the main points of the speaker named \"President.\" But wait, in the debate summary, there's no mention of a \"President\" speaking. The speakers listed are names like Mairead McGuinness, Ky\u00f6sti Virrankoski, Csaba S\u00e1ndor Tabajdi, etc. The \"President\" might be a placeholder or a mistake.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the President is mentioned in the debate summary. Scanning through the sections, the summary mentions the Commissioner Mariann Fischer Boel and various Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) like McGuinness, Virrankoski, etc. There's no mention of a \"President\" in the contributions. The debate's context is the European Parliament, so the President here might refer to the President of the European Parliament, but the summary doesn't attribute any statements to that role.\n\nSince the user specified that if there are no points attributed to the speaker, I should return an empty string. The instructions say to only include points from the specified speaker. Since the President isn't mentioned as a speaker in the provided debate summary, there are no arguments or contributions to attribute.

Mr President, I would like to start by expressing my thanks to Parliament for the support it has provided over recent months in our common goal of further establishing rural development as the second pillar of the common agricultural policy. I am convinced, as I am sure you are, that it is a policy that really adds value to the European area.\nThanks to the excellent cooperation between Parliament, the Council and the Commission, our rural development regulation was adopted last autumn. The strategic guidelines which are before you today are an essential element in taking further the process of developing national strategies and rural development programmes in the different Member States.\nI would like to thank Parliament, and in particular, the rapporteur, Mrs McGuinness, for their help in bringing the opinion forward in a very timely manner. We are still well on the way to delivering our rural development programmes on time.\nOur strategic guidelines for rural development for the period 2007 to 2013 are meant to guide Member States in the development of their own national strategies and programmes. I am convinced that our policy will offer many opportunities to make the rural development policy a success, but we will have to use it in the right way. We must use it to help unlock the innovative capacity of our agri-food and forestry sectors and the economic, environmental and social potential of our rural areas and the people who live in them. It is an extraordinary potential and it is our responsibility to do everything we can to mobilise it.\nThe Community strategic guidelines will be a first step towards achieving this, firstly by identifying and agreeing the areas where the use of European Union support for rural development will create good added value. Secondly, by making the link with both the reform of the common agricultural policy and the necessary restructuring, the strengthening of the second pillar provides opportunities both for farmers and for jobs and growth. I have made it very clear that rural development should contribute to the Lisbon and G\u00f6teborg strategies, and I think we are doing just that. Thirdly, consistency with other European Union policies will be ensured, in particular in the field of cohesion and environment.\nLet me now say a few words about the amendments. The report proposes many helpful suggestions and I am very grateful for this. In my view, many of the amendments tabled by Members reflect important issues that are not reflected adequately in the Commission proposal. These can be taken either wholly or partially into account. On the other hand, there are a number of proposed amendments which we feel are already dealt with adequately in the current text. I see this as a clear indication of the very broad consensus between the Commission and Parliament about the aims of our rural development policy.\nLet me conclude this introduction, therefore, by expressing my agreement with the issues raised by the rapporteur in her report: the role of modernisation measures, the need for measures to help to encourage young farmers and farming families to stay in rural areas, and the importance of putting the heart back into our villages, sustainable farming and preservation of the rural heritage.

Let me start by reading through the summary carefully.\n\nThe user provided a detailed executive summary of a parliamentary debate about strategic guidelines for rural development (2007-2013). The speaker in question is Mariann Fischer Boel. The task is to extract the main points, positions, arguments, and proposals made by her, without including others' contributions.\n\nLooking at the summary, there's a section under \"Key Policy Issues and Positions\" where Mariann Fischer Boel is mentioned. The text says: \"Commissioner Mariann Fischer Boel emphasized that rural development 'is a policy that really adds value to the European area' and stressed the need to 'unlock the innovative capacity of our agri-food and forestry sectors.'\" \n\nAdditionally, in the same section, it mentions: \"Commissioner Fischer Boel agreed, stating that voluntary modulation would represent 'the first step towards a re-nationalisation of European agricultural policy.'\" \n\nSo, from this, I can gather that her main points are about the value of rural development and the need for innovation in agri-food and forestry. Her position is against voluntary modulation, seeing it as a step towards re-nationalization. The argument here is that voluntary modulation would undermine the unified EU agricultural policy. There's no specific proposal mentioned, just her stance against it.\n\nI need to structure this into the JSON format as specified. The issueSum would be about the importance of rural development and innovation. The positionSum would include her agreement with the negative aspects of voluntary modulation. The argSum would be the reasoning behind her position, and propSum might not have anything, but maybe her call to unlock innovation.\n\nWait, the example response includes propSum even if there's no explicit proposal. But in the summary, she didn't make a proposal, just stated her position. So propSum might be empty. Let me check the instructions again. The user says if there are no points, respond with an empty string. So I need to see if she made any proposals.\n\nLooking back, the summary says she \"stressed the need to 'unlock the innovative capacity of our agri-food and forestry sectors.'\" That's more of a position or argument rather than a specific proposal. So maybe propSum isn't applicable here. Therefore, propSum would be an empty string.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nissueSum: The key issue is the importance of rural development and innovation in agri-food and forestry sectors.\n\npositionSum: She emphasizes the value of rural development and opposes voluntary modulation, viewing it as re-nationalization.\n\nargSum: Her argument against voluntary modulation is that it undermines unified EU agricultural policy.\n\npropSum: None, so empty string.\n\nI need to make sure not to include other speakers' points. The example response had \"He\" but since the speaker is Mariann Fischer Boel, it should be \"She\" or use the name. However, the example uses \"He\" but the user's example might be generic. The actual JSON should use the correct pronouns. But the user's example uses \"He\" but in the actual answer, it's about Mariann Fischer Boel, so \"She\" or \"The speaker\" but the example uses \"He\". However, the user's example might not be strict on that. But the actual answer should use \"She\" or \"The speaker\". However, the example given by the user uses \"He\" but the actual answer should be accurate. However, the user's instruction says to outline the main points or arguments made by that speaker. So in the JSON, the summaries should be neutral, not using pronouns. For example, \"The speaker emphasized...\" or \"The speaker stated...\".\n\nWait, looking at the example response provided by the user:\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The key issue raised by the speaker relates to how trade secrets and intellectual property would be protected under the current objectives of the Data Act.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"He supports the Data Act's objectives for a competitive data market but emphasizes concerns about legal certainty and protection of trade secrets and intellectual property. He advocates strict limitations on government demands for private data, expressing a need to prevent improper use.\",\n\"argSum\": \"His support for strict limitations on government demands for private data is based on a need to prevent improper use.\",\n\"propSum\": \"He advocates for strict limitations on government demands for private data\",\n}\n\nSo in the example, they use \"He\" but in the actual answer, since the speaker is Mariann Fischer Boel, it should be \"She\" or \"The speaker\". However, the user's example uses \"He\" but the actual answer should be accurate. However, the user's instruction says to structure the response as JSON with the summaries. The example uses \"He\" but the actual answer should use \"She\" or \"The speaker\". However, the user's example might not be strict on that. But to be accurate, I should use \"The speaker\" or \"She\".\n\nBut the user's example uses \"He\" and \"His\", so maybe the system expects the same. However, since the speaker is a female, maybe \"She\" is better. But the user's example might not care. However, the user's instruction says to outline the main points or arguments made by that speaker. So the summaries should be in third person, but the example uses \"He\". So perhaps the JSON should use \"The speaker\" to avoid gender pronouns. Let me check the example again:\n\nIn the example, \"He supports...\" but the actual speaker could be male or female. Since the user's example uses \"He\", maybe the system expects the same. However, in the actual case, the speaker is Mariann Fischer Boel, a woman. But the example uses \"He\", so maybe the user wants to follow that. However, the user's instruction says to not include other speakers' arguments, but the JSON structure is to have the summaries. So perhaps using \"The speaker\" is safer.\n\nBut the example uses \"He\", so maybe the user expects the same. However, in the actual answer, since the speaker's name is given, maybe the positionSum can refer to her. But the example uses \"He\", so perhaps the JSON should use \"He\" or \"She\" depending on the speaker. But the user's example uses \"He\", so maybe the system is expecting that. However, the user's instruction says to respond in JSON, and the example uses \"He\", but the actual speaker is female. This is a bit conflicting. However, the user's example is just an example, and the actual answer should be accurate. Therefore, I'll use \"She\" in the summaries.\n\nBut the example uses \"He\", so maybe the user expects the same. However, the user's instruction says to outline the main points or arguments made by that speaker. So in the JSON, the summaries should be neutral. For example:\n\n\"positionSum\": \"The speaker supports the Data Act's objectives...\".\n\nBut in the example, they used \"He\". So perhaps the user expects the same. However, the user's example might not be strict on that. Since the user's example uses \"He\", maybe I should follow that. But since the speaker is a woman, it's better to use \"She\". However, the user's example is generic. Maybe the system is expecting the use of \"He\" or \"She\" based on the speaker's gender. But since the user's example uses \"He\", perhaps I should use \"She\" here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the system doesn't care about the pronoun and just wants the content. So I'll proceed with \"The speaker\" to avoid any gender issues.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The key issue raised by the speaker relates to the importance of rural development in adding value to the European area and the need to unlock the innovative capacity of agri-food and forestry sectors.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"The speaker emphasizes the value of rural development and opposes voluntary modulation, viewing it as a step towards re-nationalization of European agricultural policy.\",\n\"argSum\": \"The argument against voluntary modulation is that it would undermine the unified EU agricultural policy standards.\",\n\"propSum\": \"\"\n}\n\nBut I need to check if there are any proposals. The summary says she \"stressed the need to 'unlock the innovative capacity of our agri-food and forestry sectors.'\" Is that a proposal? It's more of a position or argument. So propSum would be empty.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final JSON would have empty propSum.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The key issue raised by the speaker relates to the importance of rural development in adding value to the European area and the need to unlock the innovative capacity of agri-food and forestry sectors.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"The speaker emphasizes the value of rural development and opposes voluntary modulation, viewing it as a step towards re-nationalization of European agricultural policy.\",\n\"argSum\": \"The argument against voluntary modulation is that it would undermine the unified EU agricultural policy standards.\",\n\"propSum\": \"\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Mairead McGuinness (PPE-DE),", "english": "Mairead McGuinness (PPE-DE), rapporteur . \u2013 Mr President, at the outset I should like to thank all those who have assisted with this report and the colleagues who put forward amendments, which were extremely helpful.\nIn my past life as a journalist I had the great pleasure of reporting on the many success stories of rural development, which, as you said, Commissioner, unlocked the potential of rural areas. I mention, in particular, those under the Leader Programme. Rural development in action is much more interesting than the theory behind it. However, we need to have rules, and that is why in this report we have set out strategic guidelines to allow Member States to plan their programmes from 2007 onwards. I believe that the guidelines offer the flexibility that Member States need in order to draw up those programmes. Each Member States has different needs because rural areas differ right across the 25\u00a0Member States.\nWe talk about the two pillars of the CAP \u2013 agriculture and rural development. Some people speak of two different policies, but it is important to remember that it is a single policy with two different pillars. I am glad to hear you say, Commissioner, that agriculture is still of huge importance. We should not ignore the reality that a vibrant, commercial and sustainable farm sector is a vital component of rural life. Of course, rural development has a much wider remit: it provides for restructuring of rural regions and it allows for environmental protection and for measures to improve the quality of life for rural people.\nJust last week I presented certificates to mature students in Tullamore, a town in the midlands of Ireland. These courses were promoted by the local Leader group. Each and every one of the students spoke about what a great value it was to them and how it had improved the quality of their lives and that of their community. Benefits will flow from that. It is another example of rural development in action \u2013 and it does work.\nRural areas are different from urban areas, but the policy priorities for rural regions have to fit in with the overall objectives, as you have set out, of competitiveness and economic growth, environmental sustainability and quality-of-life issues. Because of time constraints, I will not go through all of the details. However, improving the competitiveness of agriculture, forestry and food is a priority. We need ongoing investment in research and development across all of the range of activities in rural regions.\nIn the report, we stressed the importance of job consolidation and maintenance, just as we stressed the importance of job creation. When we reform agriculture there will be changes in employment in rural areas. A quality environment is key to the future of rural regions. So, too, is the ongoing restructuring of the agriculture sector. Where we have measures in place to try to encourage young people into farming, we must ensure that they are sufficient to do just that. Across the European Union we hear of young people not wanting to farm. We may regret that in the future, as it has implications, not just for food production, but also for the quality of our rural environment and landscape. We want young people because we want a living countryside. Without people, we have very little else.\nWe also allow for regional specialities to be promoted; organic farming by traditional means is provided for as well. Once again, the priority is to ensure that these measures and this production are market led and that the measures we put in place under rural development programmes add value to these local products. Non-food uses are also very important, and other reports discussed here tonight spoke of renewable energies and biomass.\nEnsuring that the rural communities have access to basic services, such as childcare and education, is also very important. We need to talk about the quality and affordability of those services.\nA key requirement in rural regions is access to information technology: to IT training and broadband. I spoke earlier about the great success of rural development in the town of Tullamore but, in case you think all is wonderful in rural Ireland, in terms of broadband penetration, we are unfortunately languishing in 17th place in the European Union. Broadband, in my view, is just as essential as electricity to rural regions, and yet many parts of rural Europe do not have this basic facility. It means that they cannot provide jobs and that small and medium-sized enterprises are held back.\nWith regard to the budget, we did not have access to the final details when this report was being drawn up. We now know that there is a reduction EUR\u00a020\u00a0billion in funding for rural development for the period 2007 onwards, compared with what the Commission had forecast. It is a bad signal to send to rural areas.\nI have huge concerns about the possibility for Member States to cut 20\u00a0% of market support measures and direct payments and to allocate it to rural development. That is robbing Peter to pay Paul. It is, in my view, a renationalisation of agriculture policy by the back door. It is also unworkable in its current form. It now emerges that Member States who opt for this voluntary modulation can spend the money in any way they choose, without regard to the rules or indeed national cofinancing; this is regrettable.\nWe must make rural development work for people and the places in which they live. In so doing, we will continue to see the fruits of the policy and ensure that rural development has a future beyond 2013.\n(Applause)", "lang": "EN", "original": "Mairead McGuinness (PPE-DE), rapporteur . \u2013 Mr President, at the outset I should like to thank all those who have assisted with this report and the colleagues who put forward amendments, which were extremely helpful.\nIn my past life as a journalist I had the great pleasure of reporting on the many success stories of rural development, which, as you said, Commissioner, unlocked the potential of rural areas.

I would like to thank her for the excellent cooperation, as in the report she had taken into account all the comments of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament.\nI am extremely delighted that this report is in full agreement with the earlier report of Mrs\u00a0Schierhuber. I know that the issue of rural development is extremely important to the Commissioner. We all talk about the fact that rural development has been the greatest loser of the seven-year budget. It is shocking that while all of us \u2013 both the Commission and Parliament say that rural development, the second pillar, ought to be given more money, exactly the opposite is happening. And this is why the report of Mrs\u00a0McGuinnes is so important, because if there is no more money in the system, and in fact there is less money, then the system should at least be more flexible, and it should express the diversity of Member States better. In this respect, this report is very good and very useful. Incidentally, as an MEP from a new Member State, I deeply regret that the rural development fund of old Member States has been decreased by 15-20%, but the rural development fund of new Member States has only been increased marginally, to a very modest extent, even though everybody had said that they would be compensated by an increase for the long, protracted phasing-in period agreed in Copenhagen. Well, there has been no compensation, and unfortunately, the rural development fund of old Member States has been drastically reduced, perhaps forcing them to apply modulation, but obviously, this is no consolation.\nThe issues raised by Mrs\u00a0Schierhuber are very important: jobs should not only be created, but also preserved. And in this respect it is very good that the McGuinnes report supports activity diversification. In other words: we should not just give money to clear an apple orchard, but also to enable the farmer to plant a marketable crop in its place. This is a very important issue in this report, because it facilitates the preservation of jobs. The strengthening of quality products and of local products is also very important.

These regions, however, lag behind others when certain indicators are applied. For example, unemployment is greater in these areas.\nThe European countryside faces big changes. A comprehensive reform in agricultural policy has been initiated, and as a result agriculture is becoming less able to employ and sustain the population in rural areas. Special action is therefore needed to restore the vitality of the countryside.\nThe Commission is proposing several different possible solutions. The strategic guidelines are based on the EU Regulation on the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, the text of which was adopted last year. In it three axes are defined, as well as a Leader Community initiative. The report in many respects improves on the text submitted by the Commission.\nThe debate on the report is nevertheless overshadowed by the Council\u2019s terrible proposal for the EU\u2019s financial perspective for the next seven-year term.

I support the amendments of our Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, as they enhance the Council proposal. I also admire the good work done by Mrs McGuinness, the rapporteur.\nAccording to the strategy, rural development should accompany the implementation of a new, market-oriented common agricultural policy, and should support the key role of the market within this policy. This is all very well. The budget cuts proposed for the CAP in the Financial Perspective, however, are causing justifiable concern over the real benefits of rural development. Further concern results from the course of negotiations in the WTO, where it appears that European farmers could be put at a disadvantage in their competition against the rest of the world. There are also risks, however, arising from the restrictive nature of ongoing reforms, as was the case for sugar reform, as well as other reforms that are in the pipeline.\nStudies also suggest that there is a risk of the rural economy being weakened because of the transition to single payments per farm, etc. It goes without saying that the above risks are greatest in the new member countries. For example, in my country, Slovakia, following the transition to single farm payments, agricultural output is expected to fall by a further 17%. These are dramatic figures, since we have increased the importation of food by a half over the past two years due to the discriminatory influence of the CAP in the new Member States, and the export-import balance in Slovakia\u2019s agricultural sector trade has deteriorated by one-third. The worst-off are the most backward, typically rural regions that are falling behind virtually in front of our eyes. At the same time, all of the EU resolutions have stated that our policies should be working to narrow the gap that the more backward regions are facing.\nAccording to the findings of the Slovak non-governmental organisation \u2018Rural Parliament\u2019, the countryside depends entirely on the prosperity of agribusinesses for its development. Rural areas develop where agribusinesses flourish. Where business is slow in the countryside, entire rural areas are on the decline, and rural development becomes impossible. The problem of the new Member States is therefore that of a deficient rural economy resulting from the uneven effects produced by the role of the market as embodied in the CAP.", "lang": "SK", "original": "Peter Baco (NI). \u2013 Strategick\u00e9 usmernenia Spolo\u010denstva v oblasti rozvoja vidieka na programov\u00e9 obdobie 2007-2013 je dobr\u00fd a potrebn\u00fd dokument.

The quality of life required to sustain an active population in the rural sectors entails cooperation and the joint implementation of essential financial resources.\nLastly, new territorial indicators are required to improve the process of evaluating and deciding upon measures to strengthen territorial cohesion.

Our forebears worked the land not simply for survival, but also out of love for it. Today that is no longer enough. Young people must see the prospect of advancement and a decent income, as well as adequate social security. There is still very poor provision of social security for women, and it is equally unacceptable that mothers employed on farms still do not have the same rights and benefits as women employed in other sectors.\nFarmers must possess a great deal of knowledge to carry out their trade and to perform additional rural activities.

These regions create 45% of Gross Added Value and provide 53% of employment. They lag behind, however, when it comes to socio-economic indicators; income per inhabitant is around a third less, the service sector is less developed and higher education levels tend to be lower. In the period 2007 to 2013 we must aim to invest in the future, which means investing in people. This involves know-how, new ways of delivering win-win environmental services and the creation of more and better job opportunities. Particular attention should be paid to the removal of barriers for those whose access to the labour market is currently hampered because of their gender, age or disability.\nThe diversification of economic activities, the protection of the rural cultural heritage and investment in infrastructure for local services are preconditions for improving the quality of life in rural areas, and help to counter rural depopulation. It is essential to present the EU\u2019s rural areas as attractive locations for investment, work and living. They can offer enormous growth potential in the areas of tourism, accommodation and workspaces. The new programming period offers a unique opportunity to refocus support from the new rural development fund towards economic growth, employment and sustainability. We must have financial instruments in place with sufficient funds for fulfilling these targets.

to prevent re-nationalization of agricultural policy", "issueSum": "The speaker addresses three key issues: budget constraints with a EUR 20 billion reduction in the financial perspectives for rural development, the digital divide in rural areas and need for broadband access, and concerns about voluntary modulation in agricultural policy.", "positionSum": "The Commission supports ensuring efficient spending of reduced rural development funds through strategic guidelines, supports using rural development policy to bridge the digital divide, and strongly opposes voluntary modulation as it would lead to re-nationalization of European agricultural policy and create unequal competitive conditions for farmers across Member States.", "argSum": "The speaker argues that budget reductions make efficient spending even more crucial, that rural development policy has a legitimate role in addressing digital infrastructure gaps, and that voluntary modulation would be unacceptable because it would create different competitive possibilities for farmers in different Member States, representing a step toward re-nationalization of EU agricultural policy.", "propSum": "The speaker proposes to

The user provided a debate summary about rural development strategies and wants the main points from Mariann Fischer Boel's speech.\n\nFirst, I need to check the debate summary to find any mentions of Mariann Fischer Boel. The summary mentions her in the context of budget cuts and her emphasis on rural development's value. She's the Commissioner, so her contributions would be in the sections where she's quoted.\n\nLooking at the \"Broad Support with Funding Concerns\" section, it says she emphasized that rural development adds value and needs to unlock innovation in agri-food and forestry sectors. Also, in the \"Voluntary Modulation Controversy\" part, she agreed with McGuinness that voluntary modulation would lead to re-nationalization of agricultural policy.\n\nSo, the key issues she raised are about the importance of rural development and the negative impact of budget cuts. Her position is that rural development is valuable and that modulation is bad. The arguments are that it's essential for innovation and that modulation undermines EU policy. There's no mention of specific proposals from her, just her positions and arguments.\n\nI need to structure this into the JSON fields. IssueSum should cover the main issues she talked about. PositionSum her stance on rural development and modulation. ArgSum the reasons she gave. PropSum would be any proposals, but the summary doesn't mention any from her, so maybe leave it empty or note that.\n\nWait, the example response has propSum even if there's nothing. But the user said if no points, respond with empty string. So check if she proposed anything. The summary says she \"stressed the need to 'unlock the innovative capacity of our agri-food and forestry sectors.'\" That's more of a position or argument rather than a proposal. So propSum might be empty.\n\nSo the final JSON would have issueSum about funding cuts and rural development's value, positionSum her support and opposition to modulation, argSum the need for innovation and preventing re-nationalization, and propSum as empty.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The key issue raised by the speaker relates to the importance of rural development and the need to address budget cuts affecting agricultural and forestry sectors.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"The speaker emphasized the value of rural development as a critical policy area and opposed measures that could lead to the re-nationalization of agricultural policy.\",\n\"argSum\": \"The speaker argued that rural development adds value to the European area by unlocking innovation in agri-food and forestry sectors, and that voluntary modulation would undermine EU-wide agricultural policy coherence.\",\n\"propSum\": \"\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "President.", "english": "President.
