{"speaker": "Janusz Wojciechowski,", "english": "Janusz Wojciechowski, on behalf of the UEN Group . \u2013 (PL) Mr President, I congratulate Mrs\u00a0McGuinness on her excellent report on an extremely important issue. In recent times, the Union has tended to neglect rural and agricultural problems. We have often heard, even in this House, that it is not worth spending nearly half of the Union\u2019s budget on helping rural communities and farmers who account for barely 6% of society. The strategic guidelines now hold out the hope that rural and agricultural problems will receive better treatment in the future.\nAfter all, the development of rural areas is not just a matter for farmers. It concerns society as a whole. Without rural development and support for farming there can be no food security, sustainable growth or effective environmental protection.\nI am hopeful that the future of rural communities and farming in Europe will be well-served by the document we are debating today, particularly in the new Member States which are in greatest need of support for their rural areas.", "lang": "PL", "original": "Janusz Wojciechowski, w imieniu grupy UEN . \u2013 Panie Przewodnicz\u0105cy!
