{"speaker": "Elspeth Attwooll (ALDE),", "english": "Elspeth Attwooll (ALDE), draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development . \u2013 Mr President, Commissioner, the thanks of the Committee on Regional Development are due to Mrs McGuinness, not just for the quality of her final report, but also for her close cooperation with us in producing it.\nAlthough the original Commission proposal contains much of value, we have concerns about certain aspects. These include, in particular: the need for more recognition of the diversity of rural areas; greater clarity on the activities to which the individual axes are addressed; fuller attention under Axis 1 to forestry, the fuel chain and renewable energy resources; additional detail under Axis 2 as to the environmental goods to be promoted, including preservation of the cultural, as well as the natural, heritage; and a heavier emphasis under Axis 3 on measures to improve the quality of life and social inclusion in rural areas in parallel with, and as an aspect of, maintaining and developing employment.\nOn a broader level, the committee wishes to stress the promotion of both sustainability and territorial cohesion with the need for an integrated approach that would embody appropriate spatial planning and foster coherence between the actions engendered by all sources of European funding. In that context, we emphasise the importance of the partnership principle and of the broadest possible involvement of all competent authorities and appropriate bodies in developing strategies at regional and/or national level as appropriate to the Member State concerned.\nWe are delighted by the extent to which the report addresses our concerns and commend its content to the Commission, recognising, with thanks to the Commissioner, that she has already touched on some of these issues in her introduction. We commend it to the Council and to Parliament as a whole.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Elspeth Attwooll (ALDE), draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development . \u2013 Mr President, Commissioner, the thanks of the Committee on Regional Development are due to Mrs McGuinness, not just for the quality of her final report, but also for her close cooperation with us in producing it.\nAlthough the original Commission proposal contains much of value, we have concerns about certain aspects.
