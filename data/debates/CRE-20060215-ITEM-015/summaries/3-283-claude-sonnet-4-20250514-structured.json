This approach should be translated into clear objectives, incisive measures and appropriate action, the results of which can be assessed objectively.\nThe identification of priority actions to be undertaken must not, however, result in an inflexible programming exercise and in a restriction for the Member States. On the contrary, it is important to guarantee the Member States some flexibility, which enables them to make decisions about how they will intervene on the basis of what is actually happening at national, regional and local levels.\nIt is crucially important for the purposes of rural development that we revitalise, and restore the competitiveness of, our agricultural production when compared with that of the other countries, which have significantly lower production costs. In that context, moreover, it is important to foster accompanying measures that facilitate innovation, research and development.\nThe emphasis placed on the areas of excellence and quality of agricultural products, particularly those produced locally and regionally, is consistent with the Community\u2019s overall strategy. Quality must be understood not only as food safety and consumer protection, but also as value added to the competitiveness of businesses and as the expression of local traditions and of the cultural heritage of rural communities. One need only think of local crafts, environmental protection, agricultural specialities and the related traditional production techniques.\nThese objectives clearly need to be coordinated with the need to help young farmers and women enter the rural professions, by passing on traditional knowledge and skills to them, and by improving the quality of life in rural areas through the promotion of services and infrastructure.\nLastly, we must welcome the crucial aspect of bringing the experience gained through Leader to the system of local governance, building on the best practices of earlier programming exercises.", "lang": "IT", "original": "Giuseppe Castiglione (PPE-DE). \u2013 Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, signor Commissario, vorrei innanzitutto ringraziare la collega McGuinness per l\u2019ottimo lavoro svolto nella sua relazione.\nNella nuova Unione \u00e8 importante garantire un approccio strategico delle politiche d\u2019intervento, da tradurre in obiettivi chiari, in azioni incisive e in interventi adeguati, i cui risultati siano obiettivamente valutabili.\nL\u2019individuazione delle azioni prioritarie da intraprendere non deve tuttavia tradursi in una rigidit\u00e0 della programmazione e in una limitazione per gli Stati membri. Al contrario, \u00e8 importante garantire una certa flessibilit\u00e0 agli Stati membri, che consenta loro di orientare le scelte d\u2019intervento in funzione della specifica realt\u00e0 nazionale, regionale e locale.\nAi fini dello sviluppo rurale \u00e8 di fondamentale importanza ridare slancio e competitivit\u00e0 alle produzioni agricole rispetto a quelle degli altri paesi, dove i costi di produzione sono sensibilmente pi\u00f9 bassi e, in tale contesto, \u00e8 importante incentivare azioni di accompagnamento che agevolino l\u2019innovazione, la ricerca e lo sviluppo.\nL\u2019accento posto sulle tematiche dell\u2019eccellenza e della qualit\u00e0 dei prodotti agricoli, in particolare dei prodotti locali e regionali, \u00e8 coerente con la strategia globale della Comunit\u00e0. La qualit\u00e0 va intesa come sicurezza dei prodotti e tutela dei consumatori, ma anche come valore aggiunto alla competitivit\u00e0 delle imprese e come espressione delle tradizioni locali e del patrimonio culturale delle comunit\u00e0 rurali.
