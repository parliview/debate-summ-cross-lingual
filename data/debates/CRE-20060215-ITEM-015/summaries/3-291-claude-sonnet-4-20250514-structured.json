This policy must, however, go hand in hand with rational measures within the context of the common agricultural policy to stabilise traditional farm livelihoods, since only a stable livelihood on farms will enable the latter to make effective use of the support that is available from rural development funds.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Zbigniew Krzysztof Ku\u017amiuk (UEN). \u2013 ( PL) Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to the significance of rural development problems in the new Member States.\nIn Poland, rural areas became a kind of shock-absorber for the economic transformation that took place in the 1990s.
