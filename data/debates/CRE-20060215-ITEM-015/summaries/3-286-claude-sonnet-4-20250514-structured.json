Five of these regions are located in the eastern Poland. They are characterised by a poorly developed infrastructure, a fragmented agricultural structure and high unemployment, some of which is hidden on peasant family farms. The additional funds in excess of EUR 800 million earmarked in the 2007-2013 budget for eastern Poland are not a solution to the backwardness of this region. The support we need must be at least equal to the aid given by the Union to marginal and sparsely-populated regions in the old Member States. As well as financial assistance, eastern Poland, which includes the poorest Lubelszczyzna region, needs a stable agricultural policy and protection for its farmers.
