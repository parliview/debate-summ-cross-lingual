These regions create 45% of Gross Added Value and provide 53% of employment. They lag behind, however, when it comes to socio-economic indicators; income per inhabitant is around a third less, the service sector is less developed and higher education levels tend to be lower. In the period 2007 to 2013 we must aim to invest in the future, which means investing in people. This involves know-how, new ways of delivering win-win environmental services and the creation of more and better job opportunities. Particular attention should be paid to the removal of barriers for those whose access to the labour market is currently hampered because of their gender, age or disability.\nThe diversification of economic activities, the protection of the rural cultural heritage and investment in infrastructure for local services are preconditions for improving the quality of life in rural areas, and help to counter rural depopulation. It is essential to present the EU\u2019s rural areas as attractive locations for investment, work and living. They can offer enormous growth potential in the areas of tourism, accommodation and workspaces. The new programming period offers a unique opportunity to refocus support from the new rural development fund towards economic growth, employment and sustainability. We must have financial instruments in place with sufficient funds for fulfilling these targets. It is already obvious today that funding for the third axis, namely that of improving the quality of life in rural areas and the diversification of the rural economy, falls short of what is required.
