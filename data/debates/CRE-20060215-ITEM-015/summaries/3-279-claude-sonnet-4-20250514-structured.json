{"speaker": "Ky\u00f6sti Virrankoski,", "english": "Ky\u00f6sti Virrankoski, on behalf of the ALDE Group . \u2013 (FI) Mr President, the rapporteur, Mrs\u00a0McGuiness, has drafted an excellent report on the Commission\u2019s proposal on guidelines for rural development. My sincere thanks go to her for that.\nMore than half the population of the EU live in the rural areas of Europe, and these regions generate almost half the Gross Value Added in the EU. These regions, however, lag behind others when certain indicators are applied. For example, unemployment is greater in these areas.\nThe European countryside faces big changes. A comprehensive reform in agricultural policy has been initiated, and as a result agriculture is becoming less able to employ and sustain the population in rural areas. Special action is therefore needed to restore the vitality of the countryside.\nThe Commission is proposing several different possible solutions. The strategic guidelines are based on the EU Regulation on the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, the text of which was adopted last year. In it three axes are defined, as well as a Leader Community initiative. The report in many respects improves on the text submitted by the Commission.\nThe debate on the report is nevertheless overshadowed by the Council\u2019s terrible proposal for the EU\u2019s financial perspective for the next seven-year term. The Council has cut the figure for appropriations proposed by the Commission and supported by Parliament by a full EUR 19 billion; in other words, more than 20%. It is therefore completely wrecking the great efforts that Parliament and the Commission have made to establish a policy on rural development and sustaining rural populations. As a consequence, we have to wait until this issue is revisited in the finance negotiations between Parliament and the Council, and the situation is corrected as is only right and proper. We must insist on this. It is not just the need for general development of the countryside, but also greater self-sufficiency in energy for the EU, and other challenges, that depend on this.", "lang": "FI", "original": "Ky\u00f6sti Virrankoski, ALDE-ryhm\u00e4n puolesta . \u2013 (FI) Arvoisa puhemies, esittelij\u00e4 McGuinness on laatinut erinomaisen mietinn\u00f6n komission ehdotuksesta maaseudun kehitt\u00e4mist\u00e4 koskevista suuntaviivoista.

Maatalouspolitiikan kokonaisreformi on k\u00e4ynnistynyt, mink\u00e4 seurauksena maatalouden kyky ty\u00f6llist\u00e4\u00e4 ja yll\u00e4pit\u00e4\u00e4 maaseutualueiden asutusta v\u00e4henee.
