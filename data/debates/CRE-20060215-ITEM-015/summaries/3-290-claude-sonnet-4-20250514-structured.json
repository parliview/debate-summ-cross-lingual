I welcomed and approved, among other things, the emphasis given to young farmers, micro-businesses and crafts.\nThe task awaiting the European Union at a difficult time for the agricultural sector \u2013 which is made all the more critical by the health threats and the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the WTO negotiations \u2013 is one of focusing primarily on young people and of doing everything in its power to ensure that they are not forced to abandon the countryside.\nIt is therefore crucial to diversify economic activities, to create new job opportunities in rural areas, to support local initiatives such as farmers\u2019 markets and to focus on high-quality and niche products, in addition, of course, to crafts.\nAs Mrs\u00a0Attwooll, the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development, sharply underlined, we also need to ensure the sustainable use of water resources and to put the emphasis firmly on training by investing sufficient funds in this area.\nLastly, I agree with the bottom-up approach used by the Commission in its proposal. Indeed, rural development must not ignore the specific characteristics of the various regions, the strategic positions of local actors who set the guidelines for each area or, particularly, the development model for towns, which represent the real driving force of the entire regional economy.", "lang": "IT", "original": "Alfonso Andria (ALDE). \u2013 Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, vorrei innanzitutto congratularmi con la collega relatrice per l\u2019ottimo lavoro svolto e per l\u2019eccellente relazione, di cui ho apprezzato e condiviso, tra l\u2019altro, l\u2019attenzione nei confronti dei giovani agricoltori, delle microimprese e dell\u2019artigianato.\nIl compito che attende l\u2019Unione europea in un momento difficile per il comparto agricolo, reso ancora pi\u00f9 critico dalle minacce sanitarie e dall\u2019incertezza circa l\u2019esito dei negoziati in sede di OMC, \u00e8 quello di guardare innanzitutto ai giovani e di adoperarsi affinch\u00e9 essi non siano costretti ad abbandonare le campagne.\nDiventa dunque fondamentale diversificare le attivit\u00e0 economiche, creare nuovi sbocchi occupazionali nelle aree rurali, sostenere iniziative locali come i mercati agricoli e puntare su prodotti di qualit\u00e0 e di nicchia, nonch\u00e9 naturalmente sull\u2019artigianato.\nE\u2019 altres\u00ec necessario, come ha acutamente evidenziato la collega Attwooll, relatrice per parere, garantire l\u2019utilizzo sostenibile delle risorse idriche e puntare con determinazione alla formazione mediante investimenti adeguati.\nCondivido infine l\u2019approccio dal basso verso l\u2019alto, utilizzato dalla Commissione nella sua proposta.
