{"speaker": "Zita Gurmai (PSE). \u2013", "english": "Zita Gurmai (PSE). \u2013 (HU) Over half of our population lives in rural areas. Rural development throughout the European Union is a challenge for each Member State. The complete achievement of its goals would not only benefit the development of rural areas, but would also boost the entire economy of the European Community and contribute to the improvement of the quality of life of all citizens.\nEfficient rural development programmes not only improve competitiveness and provide a solid support for sustainable development, but also strengthen social cohesion and the healthy development of all social strata. This particularly applies to new Member States, whose productivity has not caught up yet with that of the old Member States. The efficient utilisation of the increased assistance granted to the second pillar facilitates the reduction of the existing differences. When we take stock of the methods and instruments required, we must pay particular attention to the natural diversity of regions within the enlarged European Union. Therefore, Member States must be given an appropriate opportunity for the flexible handling of the instruments of rural development. This will allow them to create the development programmes most suited to the particularities of the regions. The involvement of private capital is indispensable to the execution of programmes and to the consistent implementation of structure change and modernisation.\nThe creative utilisation of alternative resources and supporting a wide range of training opportunities are also crucial to the implementation of truly equal opportunities between men and women, and, by expanding the labour market, they are crucial to the involvement of as many women as possible in the process of solving rural development tasks.
