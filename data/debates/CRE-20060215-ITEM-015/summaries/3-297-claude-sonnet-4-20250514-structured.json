{"speaker": "Mariann Fischer Boel,", "english": "Mariann Fischer Boel, Member of the Commission . Mr President, I can assure you that at this late hour I will not go into detail. However, for those brave people who are still here, we need to give a decent reply to some of the questions raised.\nFirst of all, regarding the economics, it is quite clear that the outcome of the financial perspectives has not been very encouraging to many of us. It is correct that there has been a reduction of almost EUR\u00a020\u00a0billion for the next financial period, which is all the more reason we have to ensure that the funds are spent as efficiently as possible, and I hope that the strategic guidelines can help us to do that. Now we need to continue with the planning.\nI could not agree more with the rapporteur\u2019s views on broadband. The rural development policy has a role in bridging the digital divide. This year I will be exploring that with my colleague, Commissioner\u00a0Reding, to see what can be done.\nFinally, on the question of voluntary modulation, I completely agree with Mrs McGuinness. It is quite clear that if we enter into this discussion on voluntary modulation, which is not even cofinanced by Member States, that will be the first step towards a re-nationalisation of European agricultural policy, so that farmers in the different Member States will have completely different competitive possibilities. That is not acceptable.\nI congratulate Mrs McGuinness on her report. It has received a good response from the Members who were here earlier this evening. I have very much enjoyed listening to the debate.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Mariann Fischer Boel, Member of the Commission .
