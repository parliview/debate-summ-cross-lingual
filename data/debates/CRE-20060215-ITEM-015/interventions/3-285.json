{"speaker": "Marian Harkin (ALDE). \u2013", "english": "Marian Harkin (ALDE). \u2013 Mr President, first of all I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on her report and her excellent cooperation.\nPersonally, I am adamant that the rural economy, SMEs and rural networks should play a real and meaningful role in achieving the Lisbon goals. Rural development is not just an adjunct; it is not just an add-on to compensate for falling numbers in agriculture, though it may well help to achieve that. In its own right, it must contribute to increased prosperity in rural areas. In that context, I agree fully with the rapporteur that funding for rural development should not involve robbing the first pillar to pay for the second pillar. Rural development should stand on its own two feet.\nI am happy about the inclusion of my amendment on the necessity to ensure consultation, cooperation and, where appropriate, compensation for farmers when their activities are restricted owing to the enhancement of landscapes and habitats. I have always believed that if the EU requires that of farmers, it must pay compensation.\nFinally, I have one minor quibble with the rapporteur when she says that agriculture must remain central to the economies of rural areas. While food production, using the European model and food security, are of paramount importance, this should not sideline the contribution of rural development. Rural development has an increasing role to play in the maintenance of farmers\u2019 livelihoods and farm family incomes and incomes of rural dwellers, so we need to build a sustainable income stream to complement agricultural income. That has a life of its own and needs an adequate fund of its own; hence my disappointment at the cut in the budget for rural development.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Marian Harkin (ALDE). \u2013 Mr President, first of all I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on her report and her excellent cooperation.\nPersonally, I am adamant that the rural economy, SMEs and rural networks should play a real and meaningful role in achieving the Lisbon goals.
