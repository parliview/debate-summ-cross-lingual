{"speaker": "Kathy Sinnott,", "english": "Kathy Sinnott, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. \u2013 Mr President, I congratulate my colleague on this report. I agree with many of the proposed amendments and with the overall direction, but I have some concerns.\nFirstly, I am disappointed that the minimum allocation for the Leader axis in the budget will be reduced to 5%. It is proposed in the financial perspective that Member States can increase the rate of modulation by up to 20%. Given the ongoing difficulties in the agricultural sector, more resources are required. If the rates are increased, as I hope, we must ensure that ample money is allocated to axes 3 and 4, as well as 1 and 2.\nConcerning diversification, not all those leaving farming and/or rural dwellers are entrepreneurs, or interested in being so. There needs to be provision for helping people into employment and this should be reflected in the guidelines under point 3.3. Also, although support for renewable energy is highlighted in points 3.1 and 3.3 of the guidelines, it is futile to provide support for renewable energy at a local level if national policy is prohibitive to the development of the sector. We must therefore coordinate these. It is imperative that the guidelines highlight the need for consultation with those involved at local level in the preparation of the national guidelines and also in the subsequent preparation of rural development programmes.\nLastly, I should like to say to the Commissioner that in Ireland it is hard to take her recommendations on organic farming seriously, when she will not allow us to declare the island a GMO-free zone.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Kathy Sinnott, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. \u2013 Mr President, I congratulate my colleague on this report.
