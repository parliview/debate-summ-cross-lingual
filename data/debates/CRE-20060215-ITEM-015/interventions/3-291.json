These areas saw a considerable influx of workers after the mass closure of workplaces that occurred at that time. This means that Poland\u2019s rural regions need enormous financial support and a number of instruments to create employment in that environment.\nI am pleased that it is proposed to allocate more than EUR 80 billion for this purpose in the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective, and that some 10 to 20 billion of this should go to Poland. This policy must, however, go hand in hand with rational measures within the context of the common agricultural policy to stabilise traditional farm livelihoods, since only a stable livelihood on farms will enable the latter to make effective use of the support that is available from rural development funds.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Zbigniew Krzysztof Ku\u017amiuk (UEN). \u2013 ( PL) Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to the significance of rural development problems in the new Member States.\nIn Poland, rural areas became a kind of shock-absorber for the economic transformation that took place in the 1990s.
