{"speaker": "James Hugh Allister (NI). \u2013", "english": "James Hugh Allister (NI). \u2013 Mr President, funding for rural development is a key issue. It should not, as the rapporteur has said, involve robbing the first pillar in order to fund the second. Nor must we lose sight of the fact that the core and single most important component for the development of rural regions is the maintenance of sustainable agriculture at the very heart of their economies. Thus a funding formula reliant on a smash-and-grab raid on the single farm payment through excessive modulation is simply not acceptable, particularly in circumstances where there is no necessity for matching national funding.\nThere are four particular points that I want to support: first of all, the use of funds to encourage new entrants, to assist the essential transition of farm families from one generation to the next; secondly, the prioritisation of funding to allow for the modernisation of farms and help with meeting higher animal welfare and environmental standards; thirdly, maximum regional flexibility on the implementation of the rural development programme must be secured and built upon; and fourthly and finally, the proposal for village renewal and the preservation of rural heritage is vitally important in revitalising and sustaining the rural communities.\nThis is a good report. It is obviously the product of hard work by the rapporteur and I congratulate her on her efforts.", "lang": "EN", "original": "James Hugh Allister (NI). \u2013 Mr President, funding for rural development is a key issue.
