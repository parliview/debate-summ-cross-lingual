It seems to be a sort of \u2018never-ending story\u2019.\nIt is with sadness that we must admit that the Sudanese Government bears full responsibility for the fact that there is still fighting in this region. The government in Khartoum respects neither the international agreements nor the authority of the United Nations, regarding the most recent UN peace mission as a return to colonialism. It is worth noting, however, that the Sudanese Government only dares to behave in this way because it has not been isolated by the international community. As the honourable speakers before me stated, countries such as Russia guarantee arms supplies to this country.\nLet us call a spade a spade. What we are dealing with in Darfur is genocide, which should be unequivocally condemned by the UN. It is highly inappropriate that some countries, such as Russia, are blocking the work of the UN Security Council in relation to this matter. The European Parliament should exert pressure on international opinion so that Darfur may cease to be a symbol of violence and abuse.", "lang": "PL", "original": "Ryszard Czarnecki (NI). \u2013 Panie Przewodnicz\u0105cy!
