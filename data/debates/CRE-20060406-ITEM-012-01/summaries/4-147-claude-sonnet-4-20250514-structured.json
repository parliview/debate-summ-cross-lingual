{"speaker": "Carl Schlyter (Verts/ALE),", "english": "Carl Schlyter (Verts/ALE), author. \u2013 (SV) Mr\u00a0President, ever since I was first elected, we have debated the situation in Sudan. What is it that is happening there? Imagine a single friend being killed and the degree of tragedy and misery entailed in that death. Imagine, then, 180\u00a0000 friends having now died in the conflict. Imagine a single friend having his house burned down and being forced to leave his home. How does that feel? Imagine now those tears being multiplied by two million in Darfur today. Imagine the rape of a single relative, and imagine the same thing happening to tens of thousands of others. That is the extent of the humanitarian disaster to have hit Sudan.\nSo what is the government doing? In resolution after resolution we have demanded that it disarm the Janjaweed guerrillas, yet nothing happens. In resolution after resolution we have demanded that it cooperate with the international community in order to help its own population, but very little indeed happens. Matters are not helped by the fact that the UN envoy, Jan Egeland, is refused permission to travel to Darfur whenever he considers it appropriate. The Commission is now already giving EUR\u00a0160\u00a0million and my own country SEK\u00a0330\u00a0million by way of aid. If this money is to be of any use, the regime needs to cooperate rather than seek to thwart our efforts. I think that we should impose an arms embargo, irrespective of what Russia and China say, and that all the countries that give their support to an arms embargo should help one another and help prevent the arms embargo from being breached.\nWhat is more, to imprison women who resist rape is absurd, and the four young women in question should, of course, be released immediately.", "lang": "SV", "original": "Carl Schlyter (Verts/ALE), f\u00f6rfattare . \u2013 Herr talman! Sedan jag f\u00f6rst blev invald har vi diskuterat situationen i Sudan. Vad \u00e4r det som h\u00e4nder d\u00e4r? T\u00e4nk er att en enda v\u00e4n blir d\u00f6dad och vilken tragedi och el\u00e4nde det \u00e4r. T\u00e4nk er d\u00e5 att det \u00e4r 180 000 v\u00e4nner som idag har d\u00f6tt i konflikten. T\u00e4nk er en enda v\u00e4n som f\u00e5r sitt hus uppbr\u00e4nt och tvingas bort fr\u00e5n sitt hem, hur k\u00e4nns inte det? T\u00e4nk er d\u00e5 att de t\u00e5rarna multipliceras med 2 miljoner i Darfur idag. T\u00e4nk er en enda sl\u00e4kting som blir v\u00e5ldtagen, och att det upprepas tiotusentals g\u00e5nger. Det \u00e4r den omfattning p\u00e5 den humanit\u00e4ra katastrof som drabbar Sudan.\nVad g\u00f6r d\u00e5 regeringen? I resolution p\u00e5 resolution kr\u00e4ver vi att de ska avv\u00e4pna Janjaweed-gerillan, och ingenting h\u00e4nder. I resolution p\u00e5 resolution kr\u00e4ver vi att de ska samarbeta med det internationella samfundet f\u00f6r att hj\u00e4lpa sin egen befolkning, men v\u00e4ldigt lite h\u00e4nder. Saken blir inte b\u00e4ttre av att man v\u00e4grar FN:s s\u00e4ndebud Jan Egeland att \u00e5ka till Darfur n\u00e4r han anser det l\u00e4mpligt. Kommissionen ger redan idag 160\u00a0miljoner euro i bist\u00e5nd, mitt eget land 330\u00a0miljoner svenska kronor i bist\u00e5nd. Om dessa pengar ska g\u00f6ra n\u00e5gon nytta s\u00e5 kr\u00e4vs det samarbete fr\u00e5n regimen, inte att de motarbetar v\u00e5ra insatser. Jag tycker att vi ska driva igenom ett vapenembargo oavsett vad Ryssland och Kina s\u00e4ger, och att alla vi l\u00e4nder som st\u00e4ller upp p\u00e5 ett vapenembargo ska hj\u00e4lpas \u00e5t och hj\u00e4lpa till att f\u00f6rhindra att vapenembargot bryts.\nF\u00f6r \u00f6vrigt, att f\u00e4ngsla kvinnor som g\u00f6r motst\u00e5nd mot v\u00e5ldt\u00e4kt \u00e4r en absurd situation, och dessa fyra unga kvinnor ska naturligtvis genast sl\u00e4ppas fria.", "agenda_item": "1.
