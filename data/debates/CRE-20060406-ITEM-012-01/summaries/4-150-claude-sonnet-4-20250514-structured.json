When it comes to human rights and the value of human dignity, we are dealing with variable geometry: when it is close to us, human life seems to matter, but when it is far away, we do not get our act together.\nI have often driven in that part of the world. I know that barren land; I know how those people live \u2013 or rather, survive \u2013 in those conditions, even when there is no conflict. They are exposed to famine, shortages of food and a lack of drinking water. You cannot imagine how hard their lives are. Now, in their hundreds of thousands, they are being tortured, killed and the rest have fled their homes, and yet we will make another resolution here. That proves how powerless the international community is in dealing with human suffering. That is what it amounts to.\nHow many more conflicts do we need? Even in the Balkans we did not get our act together until far too late. And now Darfur is far too far away. China and Russia are very cynically blocking our efforts in the United Nations. Sudan\u2019s rotten regime \u2013 I am sorry that I have to use non-diplomatic language \u2013 is blocking UN efforts, and we are powerless.\nWhen we have international conflicts or problems, we need international governance. Otherwise, future generations will say to us: \u2018You had the problem in your hand.
