{"speaker": "Markos Kyprianou,", "english": "Markos Kyprianou, Member of the Commission . Mr President, the Commission is extremely concerned by the situation in Darfur, which is the last open conflict on the African continent. Periodic fighting continues to erupt between the belligerents and the civilian population. In particular women and children are the first to suffer from this continued violence and the persistent lack of security.\nAlthough the worst possible scenario has been contained by the prompt intervention of the African Union, the precarious status quo cannot continue much longer. Almost three million people are depending on lifeline humanitarian aid, but access and security conditions for the humanitarian organisations are limited and hampered by continued violence, including direct attacks against relief operations.\nThe conflict is now spreading rapidly into neighbouring Chad and could jeopardise the fragile Sudanese conciliation process, initiated with the signature of the comprehensive peace agreement between Khartoum and the SPLM on 9 January 2005. There is international consensus that the only way ahead is a political settlement in Darfur. The Commission, Member States and the international community are very supportive of the African Union\u2019s objective to reach a rapid peace agreement in the talks in Abuja. This could also facilitate a smooth transition of the current military responsibilities of the African Union in Darfur to the United Nations. An indispensable move, envisaged by the African Union itself, but still being opposed by Sudan.\nThe Commission believes that it is now high time for the parties, under the auspices of the African Union and with the support of the international community, to identify a roadmap to peace in Darfur and for the AU-UN transition with specific benchmarks and clearly assigned responsibilities. These would allow the international community to use all means of diplomatic pressure, including sanctions, to force the progress of the whole process.\nNevertheless, to be sustainable a political conciliation in Darfur has also to be based on the provisions of justice and international support for the construction of the region. In this context, it is important that Khartoum and the rebels contribute and assist the work of the International Criminal Court on Darfur and that the donor community is ready to provide an immediate peace dividend once a positive outcome emerges from Abuja.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Markos Kyprianou, Member of the Commission .
