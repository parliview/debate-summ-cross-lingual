{"speaker": "Kathy Sinnott,", "english": "Kathy Sinnott, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . \u2013 Mr President, my contacts in touch with those on the ground in southern Sudan inform me that there is a situation developing right now that deserves our urgent attention. While the government in Khartoum claims to keep peace agreements, which we know it does not, it funds the LRA\u00a0\u2013 the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army\u00a0\u2013 from northern Uganda to continue the genocide for them.\nThe LRA lay siege to southern Sudanese villages: killing the adults, taking the children. Young girls are abducted to become sex and labour slaves and they are also sold, traded and given as gifts to the LRA arms dealers. Young boys are terrorised into virtual slavery as guards and soldiers. The LRA is only a small force, but it is increasingly expanding because abducted young boys are being used as combatants.\nIt is planting season now in southern Sudan. Civilians should be planting but they cannot, because of the LRA threat, which is again backed by their own government. If nothing is planted, famine will result. The situation is critical, they need our protection now. We have to ask ourselves: if Russia and China can support the government, why cannot we support the suffering Sudanese people?", "lang": "EN", "original": "Kathy Sinnott, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . \u2013 Mr President, my contacts in touch with those on the ground in southern Sudan inform me that there is a situation developing right now that deserves our urgent attention.
