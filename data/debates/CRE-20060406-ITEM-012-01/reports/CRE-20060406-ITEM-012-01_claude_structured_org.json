Even in the few months that have passed since this year began, according to Mr Egeland, the UN Vice-Secretary-General with responsibility for Darfur, over 200\u00a0000 people have been driven from their homes and over 96 villages have been burned to the ground \u2013 and all this over a year since international action was taken with the intention of putting a stop to this sort of thing. This goes to show how incredibly feeble the international community is where Darfur is concerned, and the fact that the UN\u2019s Vice-Secretary-General was prevented from travelling into the crisis zone in the first place shows that the Khartoum regime is quite blatantly defying and cold-shouldering the international community and thereby making of it a laughing stock.\nThat is why it is past high time that we put a stop to our recurrent feeble protests; what is needed instead is for the United Nations, NATO, the USA, the European Union and the African Union to get together around one table in order, at last, to implement a concerted Darfur policy that amounts to more than paper resolutions. What is called for, then, is a far more massive intervention there than has been seen hitherto.\nIt is, of course, the African Union, above all others, that needs to do something, but we ourselves cannot stand idly by while, quite openly, genocide is being committed \u2013 and that is how the United States has openly described it, even though they have not drawn the necessary conclusions from that. What we are dealing with here is, quite simply, genocide. We are currently mounting sad commemorative events to remember the beginning of the genocide in Rwanda and Burundi \u2013 and we averted our eyes from those, too. Today, everyone says that we should have intervened then. We find ourselves in a similar situation today. We look away, we do not act, we do not use the means available to us \u2013 weak enough though they are \u2013 and instead content ourselves with verbal protests.\nThat makes Darfur not only a disgrace to the Sudanese regime, but also to the international and European institutions. That is why I am very glad that we in this House are again returning to this issue. To put it simply, it must be abundantly clear to us that normal or more or less normal relation with Sudan will be possible only if it for once does as it has promised and allows the international institutions to do their work there.", "lang": "DE", "original": "Bernd Posselt (PPE-DE), Verfasser . \u2013 Herr Pr\u00e4sident! Wir haben uns hier schon wiederholt mit der Lage in Darfur besch\u00e4ftigt, seit einiger Zeit allerdings nicht mehr, obwohl sich dort die Entwicklung leider Gottes in dramatischer Weise verschlechtert. Allein in den wenigen Monaten seit Anfang des Jahres sind nach Aussagen von Herrn Egeland, dem f\u00fcr Darfur zust\u00e4ndigen Vizegeneralsekret\u00e4r der UNO, mehr als 200\u00a0000 Menschen aus ihrer Heimat vertrieben und mehr als 96 D\u00f6rfer niedergebrannt worden \u2013 und dies mehr als ein Jahr nach einer internationalen Initiative, mit der all dies gestoppt werden sollte! Dies zeigt die unglaubliche Schw\u00e4che der internationalen Gemeinschaft in Sachen Darfur, und die Tatsache, dass der Vizegeneralsekret\u00e4r der UNO sogar daran gehindert wurde, \u00fcberhaupt in das Krisengebiet einzureisen, zeigt, dass das Regime in Khartum offenbar die internationale Gemeinschaft ganz offen br\u00fcskiert, boykottiert und l\u00e4cherlich macht.\nAus diesem Grund ist es h\u00f6chste Zeit, dass wir aufh\u00f6ren, nur immer wieder einmal schw\u00e4chlich zu protestieren. Vielmehr m\u00fcssen sich die Vereinten Nationen, die NATO, die USA, die Europ\u00e4ische Union sowie die Afrikanische Union zusammen an einen Tisch setzen, um in Sachen Darfur endlich eine konzertierte Politik zu betreiben, die \u00fcber papierene Resolutionen hinausgeht. Das hei\u00dft, wir brauchen dort eine wesentlich massivere Intervention, als dies bisher der Fall ist.\nNat\u00fcrlich ist hier zuerst einmal die Afrikanische Union gefordert, doch auch wir k\u00f6nnen nicht abseits stehen, wenn dort ganz offenkundig \u2013 und die USA haben das ja offen ausgesprochen, wenn auch nicht die n\u00f6tigen Konsequenzen gezogen \u2013 ein V\u00f6lkermord stattfindet. Es handelt sich schlichtweg um Genozid. Wir erinnern uns derzeit in traurigen Gedenkveranstaltungen an den Beginn des Genozids in Ruanda und Burundi, als man auch weggeschaut hat. Heute sagt jeder, man h\u00e4tte damals intervenieren sollen. Wir sind derzeit in einer \u00e4hnlichen Situation: Wir schauen weg, wir handeln nicht, wir nutzen unsere M\u00f6glichkeiten \u2013 die schwach genug sind \u2013 nicht, sondern wir begn\u00fcgen uns mit verbalen Protesten.\nDies macht den Skandal in Darfur nicht nur zu einem Skandal des sudanesischen Regimes, sondern auch zu einem Skandal der internationalen und europ\u00e4ischen Institutionen. Deshalb bin ich sehr froh, dass wir endlich im Europ\u00e4ischen Parlament dieses Thema wieder aufgreifen. Wir m\u00fcssen einfach ganz klar erkennen: Normale oder auch nur halbwegs normale Beziehungen zum Sudan werden erst m\u00f6glich sein, wenn dieser sich endlich an seine Zusagen h\u00e4lt und die internationalen Institutionen dort t\u00e4tig werden k\u00f6nnen.", "agenda_item": "1.

Imagine, then, 180\u00a0000 friends having now died in the conflict. Imagine a single friend having his house burned down and being forced to leave his home. How does that feel?

In resolution after resolution we have demanded that it cooperate with the international community in order to help its own population, but very little indeed happens. Matters are not helped by the fact that the UN envoy, Jan Egeland, is refused permission to travel to Darfur whenever he considers it appropriate. The Commission is now already giving EUR\u00a0160\u00a0million and my own country SEK\u00a0330\u00a0million by way of aid. If this money is to be of any use, the regime needs to cooperate rather than seek to thwart our efforts.

The refugee camps are packed as a result of the extensive and chaotic flight of people in need, attacked by rebels and by the Janjaweed, often with stories of pillage and rape to tell. This is a hopeless situation; the African Union is too weak and the Sudanese Government appears to be backing the Janjaweed and to be unwilling to give international rule of law, represented by the African Union and the United Nations, a chance. It seems to be backed in this by China and Russia.\nYesterday, it became known that Mr\u00a0Pronk, the UN\u2019s special envoy in Darfur, is resigning from his post. If even Mr\u00a0Pronk, who I know as an incorrigible go-getter and optimist, no longer sees a chance for the peace process, then it is really time for us to sound the alarm. In Darfur, an unprecedented brutal conflict is raging, one that gives the European Union the opportunity to show what its role outside of Europe can be. This week, the one-hundred-day Rwandan genocide is being depicted here in a photo exhibition. This event epitomises the failings of the entire international community.\nWe are now once again being put to the test. While China and Russia veto every action, the African Union is still trying to get the Sudanese Government on board, but it is too little, too late and too long-drawn-out. It is now up to the European troika, by means of money and backing of the African Union\u2019s peace force, to establish an actual presence in order to provide logistical support, access to food aid and protection for the people. This chaotic massacre, characterised by an unprecedentedly cruel conflict of interests, must finally stop.

Debate Information\n\n**Topic:** Darfur Crisis in Sudan  \n**Number of Contributions:** 13 speakers  \n**Date:** Not specified in the provided text  \n**Context:** European Parliamentary debate addressing the ongoing humanitarian catastrophe and international response to the Darfur conflict\n\n## 2. Executive Summary\n\nThe parliamentary debate on Darfur revealed unanimous condemnation of the ongoing humanitarian crisis, with speakers reporting over 200,000 deaths, 2-3 million displaced persons, and systematic violence including rape and village destruction. However, significant disagreement emerged over the appropriate international response.\n\n### Crisis Scope and Urgency\n\nAll speakers acknowledged the severity of the situation. Posselt characterized it as \"schlichtweg um Genozid\" (simply genocide), while Hall noted that \"over 3.5 million people dependent on food aid and medical aid, we cannot just stand by.\" Schlyter provided stark statistics: \"180,000 deaths, 2 million displaced people in Darfur, and tens of thousands of rapes.\" The crisis's regional spread to Chad was highlighted by multiple speakers, with van den Berg noting the resignation of persistent UN envoy Jan Pronk as a critical indicator that \"het echt tijd om de noodklok te luiden\" (it's really time to sound the alarm).\n\n### Intervention Positions\n\n**Strong Interventionists** like Posselt, Hall, and Gomes called for immediate, robust military intervention. Posselt demanded \"eine wesentlich massivere Intervention\" (much more massive intervention) beyond paper resolutions, while Gomes advocated for \"immediate deployment of a robust, well-equipped stabilization force under UN Charter Chapter VII.\" Hall argued that UN involvement was not colonialism but \"a sad recognition that earlier initiatives to rein in the violence have largely failed.\"\n\n**Cautious Voices** emerged from Kohl\u00ed\u010dek, who warned against \"snaze o \u0159e\u0161en\u00ed situace silou\" (attempts to resolve the situation by force) and suggested that international interest coincided suspiciously with oil discoveries. Vatanen expressed frustration with international powerlessness but offered no concrete solutions.\n\n### Institutional Failures\n\nMultiple speakers criticized international institutional inadequacy. Attard-Montalto condemned the UN's ineffectiveness: \"The United Nations cannot do anything... cannot even visit the site where atrocities are taking place.\" Scheele characterized the situation as \"Rwanda in slow motion,\" while several speakers blamed Russia and China for blocking Security Council action and supplying weapons to Sudan.\n\n### Proposed Solutions\n\n**Military/Security Measures:** Most speakers supported transitioning from the overwhelmed 7,000-strong African Union force to UN peacekeeping under Chapter VII. Specific proposals included arms embargos (supported by Schlyter despite Russian-Chinese opposition) and oil export restrictions.\n\n**Diplomatic Initiatives:** Commission representative Kyprianou emphasized that \"the only way ahead is a political settlement\" and called for \"a roadmap to peace in Darfur with specific benchmarks and clearly assigned responsibilities.\"\n\n**Justice and Accountability:** Multiple speakers demanded International Criminal Court investigations and an end to impunity for war crimes.\n\n### European Union Role\n\nVan den Berg argued that \"de geloofwaardigheid van Europa's rol in de wereld staat op het spel\" (Europe's credibility in the world is at stake), calling for immediate EU financial and logistical support. Gomes specifically advocated for \"strong European contribution\" to UN peacekeeping operations.\n\n### Critical Timeline Issues\n\nSinnott highlighted immediate threats during planting season: \"It is planting season now in southern Sudan... If nothing is planted, famine will result,\" emphasizing the urgency of protecting civilians to prevent additional humanitarian catastrophe.\n\n### Consensus and Divisions\n\nWhile unanimous in condemning the crisis and Sudanese government obstruction, speakers divided on intervention methods. The majority supported robust international military intervention, viewing diplomatic solutions as insufficient given three years of failed negotiations. However, concerns about Western military intervention and resource-driven motivations created some hesitation about purely military solutions.\n\nThe debate revealed broad agreement on the moral imperative to act, with sharp divisions over whether the international community should prioritize immediate military intervention or continue pursuing diplomatic settlements while the humanitarian crisis deepens.", "src_model": "claude", "model_type": "claude", "model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "structured": true, "incremental": false, "hierarchical": false, "grouped": false, "shuffle": false, "prompt": false, "lang": "original"}
