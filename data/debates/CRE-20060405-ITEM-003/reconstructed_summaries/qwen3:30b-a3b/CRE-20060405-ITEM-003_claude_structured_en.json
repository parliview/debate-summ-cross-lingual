The \"President\" might refer to Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, who is the Commission President. But the user specified \"President\" as the speaker name. However, in the debate summary, Barroso is mentioned as the Commission President, not the President of the Parliament. \n\nWait, the user's instruction says that if there are no points attributed to the speaker, respond with an empty string. Since the debate summary doesn't mention a speaker named \"President\" specifically, except for Barroso as Commission President, but the user's input is \"President,\" which might be a typo or misreference.

If you look at the detailed analysis of the Financial Perspective for the enlarged EU that the temporary committee has worked to produce, you will realise that even this result leaves out some of the things we urgently need in order to add European value or means that others will have to be worked on over the next seven years.\nEven so, let me say that, under the prevailing conditions under which we had to work, everyone involved went to the very limit of what could be expected of them in finding a long-term solution to the Financial Perspective and an inter-institutional agreement. The President was quite right to point out that Parliament\u2019s concern has not been merely with figures; it has also been interested in the qualitative aspects and in making a start on the reform of European budgetary policy, in new financial instruments, in the de-bureaucratisation of the whole procedure, and in guaranteeing parliament\u2019s rights in the foreign policy instruments, as well as in the question of what part Parliament is to play in any potential review in 2008/2009.\nWe have, then, within the bounds set by the inter-institutional agreement, by means of joint and unilateral statements, worked through the whole of this package of qualitative elements and reform projects, and we believe that we have done so adequately; we have, at any rate, in every respect taken a line that adds up to progress towards a qualitatively improved European budget policy.\nBearing in mind our detailed knowledge of the programmes \u2013 for we have gone deeper in analysing them than the Council ever has \u2013 Parliament took the view that the figures we agreed on represented the absolute pain threshold, but if, for example, we have, in the sphere of lifelong learning or overall as regards competitiveness for growth and job creation, succeeded in getting an extra EUR\u00a02.1 billion in order, for example, to send 40\u00a0000 more students on exchange within Europe, then our commitment to European added value has paid off.\nI would like to express my thanks to the whole negotiating team under Janusz Lewandowski\u2019s chairmanship, to Mr Walter and Mr Mulder for their excellent cooperation and also to the group coordinators. It was only because we worked very much across group boundaries and as a close-knit and single-minded negotiating team that we managed to achieve this result at all, and for that I am most warmly appreciative.\n(Applause)", "lang": "DE", "original": "Reimer B\u00f6ge (PPE-DE), Berichterstatter . \u2013 Herr Pr\u00e4sident, liebe Kolleginnen und Kollegen!

I truly believe that the outcome of those negotiations is clearly better than the agreement reached at the European Council.\nKnowing at first hand how hard it has been to get to this stage, I can honestly say that this is a success. It is good news for Europe because it means we now have the funds to match our ambitions for the development of the Union over the next seven years. We now have a clear financial framework to boost development of the ten new Member States that joined in 2004, and of the two new Member States still to come.\nI am particularly pleased that we will have increased funding for programmes directly related to the new Lisbon Agenda, namely, research, lifelong learning, trans-European networks, competitiveness and innovation. Almost EUR\u00a050\u00a0billion will be available over the next seven years to enhance the research effort at Union level. Moreover, for the first time the agreement entails a joint effort with the European Investment Bank. European Investment Bank funds act as catalysts for public and private investors in research and technological development, as well as trans-European networks and small and medium-sized enterprises. There will also be significant increases in funding in the important area of justice and home affairs.\nAnother of my priorities, as you will recall \u2013 it was the subject of my letters to the President-in-Office of the Council, and of some of my statements here in Parliament \u2013 was to secure additional funding for programmes that reach out to our citizens, such as culture, youth, health and consumer protection.

In the summary, under \"Supporters of the Agreement,\" Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso is noted.

I recommend that all of us consider not only the national interest \u2013 or what we believe to be the national interest, but should consider the interests of the community, the interests of the European Union, of the Europe in which we share.

We can take pride in having had such a negotiating group to achieve this result.\nWe have a high responsibility for the European Union, and that responsibility is not in the least to do with money; on the contrary, it is all about democracy, parliamentarianism, transparency and openness. It is about winning over the public to the cause of Europe, so that this Europe of ours may be convincing. That is why, when European funds are spent at the national level, we want the national authorities to share responsibility for this money being spent properly. Where there are deficits, they must not always be attributed to the European Union, for the national authorities must accept their share of responsibility for them.\nWe insist on the European Parliament being given a say in, and responsibility for, reviewing the European Union\u2019s outgoings in 2008/2009. Let me say, with all the emphasis I can muster, that there must be no repetition of the haggling that we have seen going on over recent weeks and months. This must be the last time that our negotiations should be so lacking in conviction.

In 2008-2009, we will be reviewing all the figures all over again. Those who are currently dissatisfied \u2013 dissatisfied, that is, with everything \u2013 should note that the consequence of this is that part of the process that has been set in motion by the change in the EU\u2019s budget is a first step. The Commission has undertaken to submit proposals for the necessary next steps in respect of the revision clause to be taken in 2008/2009.\nWhat has been agreed is better financial management, and that is a vitally important step. It is quite essential that the resources at our disposal be actually spent and used effectively. Actually putting into effect the undertakings we have given each other and the agreements we have made with one another will be a great step forward.\nThere is another great step forward that we have taken, and it has to do with the requirement that the Member States should now produce their own reports with evidence of what they have done with the resources, and \u2013 as Mr Poettering has just said \u2013 this represents the abandonment of the attitude that \u2018success is national, but failure is in Brussels\u2019. The Member States must now give an account of what use they and their authorities have actually made of the money. It is quite vital that that should have been agreed to.\nIt has also proved possible to extract more money, and for that I want to take this opportunity to say: Thank you, Mr\u00a0B\u00f6ge, thank you, Mr\u00a0Mulder, thank you, Mr\u00a0Lewandowski, but I would also, and on behalf of my group, like to thank our colleague Mr\u00a0Walter, who \u2013 as other members can testify \u2013 drove a hard bargain for our group in the closing stages.

The user's example has \"propSum\": \"He advocates for strict limitations on government demands for private data\", which is a proposal. So for Schulz, the proposal would be the revision clause and accountability measures. But the exact wording in the summary is that he \"praised the revision clause for 2008-2009 and new accountability measures\".\n\nSo, the propSum would be the inclusion of the revision clause and accountability measures. The argSum would be that these elements are important for the budget's effectiveness. The position is that the agreement is a victory for reason. The issue is the balance between what was achieved and the need for flexibility.\n\nI need to phrase these concisely. Let me check again:\n\nissueSum: Maybe the adequacy of the budget and the need for flexibility? But the summary doesn't mention him raising issues beyond the agreement's merits. The key issue he's addressing is the compromise reached, so perhaps the issue is the balance between what was achieved and the need for future adjustments.\n\npositionSum: He sees the agreement as a victory for reason, acknowledging it's less than desired but more than expected.\n\nargSum: The argument is that the revision clause and accountability measures are crucial for addressing future needs and ensuring transparency.\n\npropSum: The proposals are the revision clause and accountability measures.\n\nI need to make sure each section is a summary without markdown.

The user provided a parliamentary debate summary and wants the main points from Francis Wurtz's speech. First, I need to locate where Francis Wurtz is mentioned in the debate summary.\n\nLooking at the \"Critics and Opposition\" section, Francis Wurtz is noted for criticizing budget cuts as inadequate for enlargement needs. His exact quote is, \"There is no point in us harbouring lofty ambitions if we reject the financial resources needed to fulfill them.\" \n\nThe user's instructions specify that I should only include points attributed to the mentioned speaker. So, I need to extract his arguments without mixing in others. \n\nThe key issue here is the adequacy of the budget for enlargement. His position is that the cuts are insufficient. The argument is that without proper funding, the EU's ambitions in enlargement can't be met. There's no mention of specific proposals from him, just his criticism. \n\nI need to structure this into the JSON fields. \"issueSum\" should mention enlargement needs and budget cuts. \"positionSum\" would state his criticism of the budget cuts. \"argSum\" is his argument about the lack of resources hindering ambitions. \"propSum\" might be empty since he didn't propose a specific action, just pointed out the problem. \n\nWait, the example response has \"propSum\" even if there's no proposal. But the user said if there are no points, return an empty string. Since Wurtz didn't mention any proposals, just criticisms, \"propSum\" should be an empty string.

On the one hand, I wished to recognise the efforts of our negotiators and all their good work. I was also much relieved that 15\u00a0months of uncertainty and dissent threatening the Union\u2019s finances had been brought to an end in this way. There was a risk that lack of a new Financial Perspective would mean us debating all the budget parameters except for compulsory expenditure on an annual basis and running permanently behind with adoption of the budget. That is the positive aspect of the situation.\nOn the other hand it must be pointed out that the new Financial Perspective certainly falls short of expectations, as it implies drastic restrictions to the redistribution of Union resources. It is anticipated that the Union\u2019s GNI will increase by about 15% between 2007 and 2013, whilst its budget will only increase by around 2% in the same period. The figures speak for themselves. Against this background, the Council\u2019s resistance to adopting our negotiators\u2019 very modest proposals amounts to pettiness.\nIt has often been said that certain political tendencies represented in this House demonstrate an incomprehensible Euroscepticism, and that this is especially the case of those originating from the new Member States. I am actually interested in establishing which of the parties are Eurosceptic and perhaps even anti-European. Might they perhaps turn out to be the governments of those states that are constantly cutting Union budget expenditure, and that believe it is possible to create more Europe for less money?\nI shall urge colleagues in the UEN\u00a0Group to support the compromise on the new Financial Perspective. Nonetheless, if we continue to regularly fall below the thresholds set in the Perspective in the annual budgets, the Union\u2019s future will be bleak indeed. I simply suggest not blaming the new Member States for such a situation. The Union\u2019s financial problems are largely due to meanness of the old Member States.\n(Applause)", "lang": "PL", "original": "Wojciech Roszkowski, w imieniu grupy UEN . \u2013 Panie Przewodnicz\u0105cy!

Let me read through the debate summary again to make sure I get the details right.\n\nThe debate was about the Financial Perspective for the EU budget 2007-2013. The key points mentioned under \"Fundamental Critics\" include Nigel Farage. The summary says he \"questioned the entire EU budget system, noting auditors had refused to sign off accounts for 11 consecutive years, calling it 'fatally flawed' and predicting Britain would stop contributing 'within a few years.'\"\n\nSo, the user is asking for the main points or arguments made by Nigel Farage. The instructions say to only include what's attributed to him. \n\nFirst, the issue he raised: the EU budget system's flaws, specifically the auditors not signing off for 11 years. That's the key issue. \n\nHis position: He's critical of the EU budget, calling it fatally flawed. He's against the current system, and he predicts Britain will stop contributing. \n\nArguments: The main argument is that the budget system is flawed because of the audit issues. The 11-year refusal by auditors is the basis for his claim that it's fatally flawed. \n\nProposals: He didn't suggest any specific proposals, but he did mention that Britain would stop contributing. However, the user's example includes \"propSum\" as a proposal. But in his case, he's not proposing a solution, just pointing out the problem and a prediction. The summary doesn't mention any specific proposals from him, only his criticism and prediction. \n\nSo, for \"propSum,\" maybe there's nothing. But the example shows that even if there's no proposal, maybe it's an empty string. The user's instruction says if there are no points, respond with an empty string. However, in the example given, the \"propSum\" is a proposal.

The debate summary lists him under \"Fundamental Critics.\" His main points are about the EU's budget being flawed. He compares the EU's 1 trillion euro budget over seven years to the US's 2.5 trillion annual budget. He also criticizes the Lisbon competitiveness goal as unrealistic, likening it to Khrushchev's failed promises.\n\nNow, I need to structure the response into the four JSON fields: issueSum, positionSum, argSum, propSum. \n\nFor issueSum, the key issue is the adequacy of the EU budget compared to other entities. Martinez's main argument is about the budget's insufficiency. \n\nPositionSum should state his position: criticizing the budget's Malthusian policy and the unrealistic Lisbon goals. \n\nArgSum would be his reasoning, comparing EU and US budgets and citing historical failures. \n\nPropSum might not have specific proposals, but he does mention the need for a different approach, so maybe highlighting the need for a more realistic budget strategy.\n\nWait, the user said if there are no points, return an empty string. But Martinez did make points. Let me check again. The summary says he criticized the EU's \"Malthusian economic policy\" and the Lisbon goal's realism. So his arguments are based on these comparisons. \n\nI need to ensure that only his points are included, no others. The user's example has specific fields, so I'll map accordingly. No proposals mentioned, so propSum might be empty. But the example includes propSum even if it's a call to action. Martinez's \"fatally flawed\" system and prediction about Britain stopping contributions could be part of his position or arguments. \n\nWait, the user's example for propSum is \"He advocates for strict limitations...\" So maybe Martinez's proposals are not explicit, but his arguments are the comparisons. So propSum might be empty. Let me verify the original text. The debate summary says Martinez \"criticized the EU's 'Malthusian economic policy'\" and compared the budget to the US, and called Lisbon goals unrealistic. So his arguments are based on these comparisons. \n\nTherefore, issueSum: EU budget's adequacy vs. US. PositionSum: Criticizes Malthusian policy and unrealistic goals. ArgSum: Based on comparison to US budget and historical failures. PropSum: None, as he didn't propose specific actions, just criticized. But maybe his call for a different approach is a proposal.

The user provided a parliamentary debate summary and wants the main points from Pedro Guerreiro (GUE/NGL). First, I need to locate his contributions in the summary.\n\nLooking at the \"Critics and Opposition\" section, Pedro Guerreiro is mentioned. The key points here are his condemnation of the agreement as representing a significant reduction from Parliament's original proposal. He mentions a specific figure: EUR 108 billion down. Also, he argues the funds are inadequate for the economic, social, and environmental situations in the enlarged EU.\n\nNow, I need to structure this into the required JSON format. The user specified not to include other speakers' arguments, only Pedro's. So, the issueSum should mention the adequacy of the budget. PositionSum would be his stance that the agreement is insufficient. The argument is based on the EUR 108 billion cut and the inability to address EU challenges. Proposals? The summary doesn't mention any specific proposals from him, just his criticism. So propSum might be empty. Let me check again. The original text says he \"condemned the agreement as representing 'EUR 108 billion down from Parliament's original proposal' and argued the amounts were 'woefully inadequate...'\". There's no mention of proposals, so propSum is an empty string. Alright, that's all. Need to make sure the JSON is correctly formatted.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The adequacy of the EU budget in addressing the economic, social, and environmental needs of the enlarged EU.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"Condemned the agreement as representing a significant reduction from Parliament's original proposal and argued the allocated funds were insufficient for the challenges of the enlarged EU.\",\n\"argSum\": \"Cited a specific reduction of EUR 108 billion from Parliament's original proposal and claimed the amounts were 'woefully inadequate' for addressing the economic, social, and environmental situation in the enlarged EU.\",\n\"propSum\": \"\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}]
