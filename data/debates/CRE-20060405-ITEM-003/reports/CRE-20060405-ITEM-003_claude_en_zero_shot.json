The President was quite right to point out that Parliament\u2019s concern has not been merely with figures; it has also been interested in the qualitative aspects and in making a start on the reform of European budgetary policy, in new financial instruments, in the de-bureaucratisation of the whole procedure, and in guaranteeing parliament\u2019s rights in the foreign policy instruments, as well as in the question of what part Parliament is to play in any potential review in 2008/2009.\nWe have, then, within the bounds set by the inter-institutional agreement, by means of joint and unilateral statements, worked through the whole of this package of qualitative elements and reform projects, and we believe that we have done so adequately; we have, at any rate, in every respect taken a line that adds up to progress towards a qualitatively improved European budget policy.\nBearing in mind our detailed knowledge of the programmes \u2013 for we have gone deeper in analysing them than the Council ever has \u2013 Parliament took the view that the figures we agreed on represented the absolute pain threshold, but if, for example, we have, in the sphere of lifelong learning or overall as regards competitiveness for growth and job creation, succeeded in getting an extra EUR\u00a02.1 billion in order, for example, to send 40\u00a0000 more students on exchange within Europe, then our commitment to European added value has paid off.\nI would like to express my thanks to the whole negotiating team under Janusz Lewandowski\u2019s chairmanship, to Mr Walter and Mr Mulder for their excellent cooperation and also to the group coordinators.

I would like, in particular, to congratulate Mr B\u00f6ge, Mr Lewandowski, Mr\u00a0Mulder and Mr Walter for their remarkable job, which I know was done under very difficult conditions. I would also like to thank Chancellor Sch\u00fcssel and his Finance Minister, for their untiring efforts to reach an agreement.

We now have a clear financial framework to boost development of the ten new Member States that joined in 2004, and of the two new Member States still to come.\nI am particularly pleased that we will have increased funding for programmes directly related to the new Lisbon Agenda, namely, research, lifelong learning, trans-European networks, competitiveness and innovation. Almost EUR\u00a050\u00a0billion will be available over the next seven years to enhance the research effort at Union level. Moreover, for the first time the agreement entails a joint effort with the European Investment Bank. European Investment Bank funds act as catalysts for public and private investors in research and technological development, as well as trans-European networks and small and medium-sized enterprises.

Thanks to that agreement, it will be possible to enhance substantially the Union\u2019s common foreign and security policy.\nThe agreement reached by the negotiators will now have to be endorsed by Parliament and the Council. We hope this happens without further delay. We have also worked hard to ensure that the future budget of the European Union will be based on principles of sound financial management. I also take very good note of what Mr\u00a0B\u00f6ge just said on that: it is not just about figures. Figures have increased, yes, but it is not just about figures, it is about transparency, it is about accountability, it is about the quality of the expenditure and the quality of the way we work together \u2013 Parliament, the Council and the Commission.\nIt is fair to say that the role of Parliament in the process has been strengthened and it will also play an important role in the review of the financial perspectives, which will be one of the top priorities in the coming years. I can confirm to you today something I have said on several occasions: as you know, we have been asked by the Council to come up with a proposal for a \u2018review clause\u2019 for the future of the financial perspectives and we want to work as closely as possible with Parliament on that matter.\nI know it was difficult. I know that not everybody is happy and nobody will be completely happy \u2013 let me say that the Commission is not completely happy \u2013 but it was once again a good demonstration of our commitment and our spirit of partnership, that is why I want warmly to congratulate all negotiators. I think we should celebrate this achievement and then move swiftly to build on the momentum created by this agreement to accelerate and complete the legislative process necessary to get all programmes up and running as from next year.

On the one hand, I wished to recognise the efforts of our negotiators and all their good work. I was also much relieved that 15\u00a0months of uncertainty and dissent threatening the Union\u2019s finances had been brought to an end in this way. There was a risk that lack of a new Financial Perspective would mean us debating all the budget parameters except for compulsory expenditure on an annual basis and running permanently behind with adoption of the budget. That is the positive aspect of the situation.\nOn the other hand it must be pointed out that the new Financial Perspective certainly falls short of expectations, as it implies drastic restrictions to the redistribution of Union resources. It is anticipated that the Union\u2019s GNI will increase by about 15% between 2007 and 2013, whilst its budget will only increase by around 2% in the same period. The figures speak for themselves. Against this background, the Council\u2019s resistance to adopting our negotiators\u2019 very modest proposals amounts to pettiness.\nIt has often been said that certain political tendencies represented in this House demonstrate an incomprehensible Euroscepticism, and that this is especially the case of those originating from the new Member States. I am actually interested in establishing which of the parties are Eurosceptic and perhaps even anti-European. Might they perhaps turn out to be the governments of those states that are constantly cutting Union budget expenditure, and that believe it is possible to create more Europe for less money?\nI shall urge colleagues in the UEN\u00a0Group to support the compromise on the new Financial Perspective. Nonetheless, if we continue to regularly fall below the thresholds set in the Perspective in the annual budgets, the Union\u2019s future will be bleak indeed.

On the one hand, I wished to recognise the efforts of our negotiators and all their good work. I was also much relieved that 15\u00a0months of uncertainty and dissent threatening the Union\u2019s finances had been brought to an end in this way. There was a risk that lack of a new Financial Perspective would mean us debating all the budget parameters except for compulsory expenditure on an annual basis and running permanently behind with adoption of the budget. That is the positive aspect of the situation.\nOn the other hand it must be pointed out that the new Financial Perspective certainly falls short of expectations, as it implies drastic restrictions to the redistribution of Union resources. It is anticipated that the Union\u2019s GNI will increase by about 15% between 2007 and 2013, whilst its budget will only increase by around 2% in the same period. The figures speak for themselves. Against this background, the Council\u2019s resistance to adopting our negotiators\u2019 very modest proposals amounts to pettiness.\nIt has often been said that certain political tendencies represented in this House demonstrate an incomprehensible Euroscepticism, and that this is especially the case of those originating from the new Member States. I am actually interested in establishing which of the parties are Eurosceptic and perhaps even anti-European. Might they perhaps turn out to be the governments of those states that are constantly cutting Union budget expenditure, and that believe it is possible to create more Europe for less money?\nI shall urge colleagues in the UEN\u00a0Group to support the compromise on the new Financial Perspective. Nonetheless, if we continue to regularly fall below the thresholds set in the Perspective in the annual budgets, the Union\u2019s future will be bleak indeed. I simply suggest not blaming the new Member States for such a situation. The Union\u2019s financial problems are largely due to meanness of the old Member States.\n(Applause)"}, {"speaker": "Nigel Farage,", "english": "Nigel Farage, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . \u2013 Mr President, I feel, having listened to what has been said this morning, that the European Parliament is once again indulging in its favourite sport and pastime, that of navel gazing.

Mr\u00a0Barroso, you need to go back to the days of Dr\u00a0Salazar in order to find that principle, when the United States, in 100\u00a0years, has only had 38 balanced budgets.\nIn other words, if our plan was to revise our financial perspective, then we should have revised the ultraliberal ideology underpinning it, but to question the three scourges of Anglo-Saxon thinking \u2013 Malthus, Adam Smith and Ricardo \u2013 was quite another matter."}, {"speaker": "President.", "english": "President.

Debate Information\n\n**Date:** April 5, 2006  \n**Topic:** State of progress of negotiations on the Financial Perspective (2007-2013 EU budget framework)  \n**Number of Contributions:** 12 speakers representing institutional leadership and all major political groups  \n**Context:** Parliamentary debate following the conclusion of trilogue negotiations between Parliament, Council, and Commission on the EU's multi-annual financial framework\n\n## 2. Executive Summary\n\n### Institutional Leadership Response\n\nThe **President** announced that Parliament's negotiating team, led by Lewandowski, had reached agreement with the Council and Commission, securing EUR 4 billion in additional funding above the Council's December position, plus EUR 2.5 billion in European Investment Bank reserves. The agreement particularly benefited programs that had been severely cut, including \"Erasmus, life-long learning programmes, innovation and assistance for small and medium-sized businesses.\"\n\n**Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso**, Commission President, expressed strong satisfaction with the outcome, stating \"I truly believe that the outcome of those negotiations is clearly better than the agreement reached at the European Council\" [Barroso, 2006-04-05]. He emphasized that almost EUR 50 billion would be available for research over seven years and highlighted increased funding for citizen-focused programs. Crucially, Barroso noted that success should be measured beyond mere figures: \"it is not just about figures, it is about transparency, it is about accountability, it is about the quality of the expenditure\" [Barroso, 2006-04-05].\n\n### Parliamentary Rapporteur's Assessment\n\n**Reimer B\u00f6ge** (PPE-DE), the rapporteur, provided a candid assessment of the negotiations' outcome. While openly admitting \"I am not satisfied with the outcome\" [B\u00f6ge, 2006-04-05], he acknowledged that \"under the prevailing conditions under which we had to work, everyone involved went to the very limit of what could be expected of them.\" He emphasized that Parliament's priorities extended beyond budgetary figures to include qualitative reforms, new financial instruments, and de-bureaucratization procedures. B\u00f6ge defended the agreement by highlighting concrete achievements, such as enabling \"40,000 more students on exchange within Europe\" through additional funding for lifelong learning programs.\n\n### Political Group Positions\n\n**Hans-Gert Poettering** (PPE-DE) adopted a conditional \"yes, but\" position, emphasizing the importance of considering \"not only the national interest \u2013 or what we believe to be the national interest, but should consider the interests of the community, the interests of the European Union\" [Poettering, 2006-04-05]. He strongly advocated for Parliament's involvement in the 2008/2009 review process and called for developing EU own resources to prevent future contentious negotiations, declaring that \"there must be no repetition of the haggling that we have seen going on over recent weeks and months\" [Poettering, 2006-04-05].\n\n**Martin Schulz** (PSE) characterized the agreement as \"less than we wanted, more than what many of us expected, and a victory for reason\" [Schulz, 2006-04-05]. He particularly welcomed the revision clause for 2008-2009, improved financial management requirements, and new accountability measures requiring Member States to report on their use of EU funds, thus ending \"the attitude that 'success is national, but failure is in Brussels'\" [Schulz, 2006-04-05].\n\n**Graham Watson** (ALDE) supported the agreement while expressing concern about insufficient funding for key priorities. He warned that \"we are not providing enough money for the research and development that our Union needs for the Galileo Programme, for the trans-European networks, for lifelong learning\" [Watson, 2006-04-05]. Watson advocated for using the agreed review to reassess EU financing and achieving proper auditor sign-off on accounts as \"a minimum for regaining public confidence.\"\n\n### Critical Voices\n\n**Monica Frassoni** (Verts/ALE) delivered sharp criticism, stating she did not believe \"this agreement will be able to provide us with adequate funds for our ambitions\" [Frassoni, 2006-04-05]. She highlighted significant cuts to rural development (EUR 20 billion) and lack of funding for environmental programs like Natura 2000. Frassoni argued that \"the basic problem remains the same, namely that the Member States are unwilling to finance the European Union's necessary programmes\" [Frassoni, 2006-04-05].\n\n**Francis Wurtz** (GUE/NGL) opposed the agreement entirely, arguing that \"there is no point in us harbouring lofty ambitions if we reject the financial resources needed to fulfil them\" [Wurtz, 2006-04-05]. He contended that enlargement costs were predictable and legitimate, making the budget cuts particularly problematic. His group believed \"our credibility depends on our rejecting this farce and that, consequently, we must shoulder our responsibilities\" [Wurtz, 2006-04-05].\n\n**Wojciech Roszkowski** (UEN) expressed mixed feelings, supporting the compromise while criticizing the budget's inadequacy. He highlighted that while the Union's GNI would increase by 15% between 2007-2013, the budget would only increase by 2%. Significantly, he challenged accusations of Euroscepticism against new Member States, arguing that \"the Union's financial problems are largely due to meanness of the old Member States\" [Roszkowski, 2006-04-05].\n\n### Eurosceptic Opposition\n\n**Nigel Farage** (IND/DEM) rejected the entire framework, questioning whether an EU budget was needed at all. He highlighted that \"auditors have refused to sign off the accounts for 11 years in a row\" and criticized British contributions to what he called subsidizing economic competitors, declaring \"there will be no British cheque coming to any of you within a few years\" [Farage, 2006-04-05].\n\n**Jean-Claude Martinez** (NI) criticized the budget as fundamentally inadequate, comparing the EUR 1,000 billion seven-year EU budget unfavorably to the USD 2,500 billion annual US budget. He argued for rejecting \"the ultraliberal ideology\" underpinning EU fiscal policy.\n\n**Pedro Guerreiro** (GUE/NGL) condemned the agreement as \"bad news because it is EUR 108 billion down from Parliament's original proposal\" [Guerreiro, 2006-04-05], arguing the amounts were \"woefully inadequate for the purpose of tackling the economic, social and environmental situation in the enlarged EU.\"\n\n### Key Outcomes and Future Implications\n\nThe debate revealed broad but reluctant acceptance of the compromise across mainstream political groups, with significant concern about adequacy of funding for EU ambitions. Critical elements included establishment of a revision clause for 2008-2009, improved financial management procedures, and enhanced parliamentary oversight. However, fundamental tensions remained between EU ambitions and available resources, with calls for developing EU own resources to avoid future contentious negotiations based on national interests.", "src_model": "claude", "model_type": "claude", "model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "structured": false, "incremental": false, "hierarchical": false, "grouped": false, "shuffle": false, "prompt": false, "lang": "english"}
