This means that the Council and Parliament only differed over an extra \u2018nought point something\u2019 in relation to GDP, because they draw their inspiration from the same source, which can be summed up in two words: Malthusianism in terms of economic policy and fundamentalism in terms of budgetary policy. Malthusianism is everywhere in the Union and in the CAP, regarding quotas, set-aside and the uprooting of vines. The European Parliament, in this very Chamber, inflicts poverty on its catering staff and its drivers, who earn the shameful sum of EUR\u00a01\u00a0000 per month! This is an example of the sordid economic reality that is reflected in the fundamentalism of our budgetary policies and in the budgetary technique of the Union\u2019s Financial Regulation. Everything is done to avoid spending! The Union\u2019s Financial Regulation lays down the principle of budgetary balance. Mr\u00a0Barroso, you need to go back to the days of Dr\u00a0Salazar in order to find that principle, when the United States, in 100\u00a0years, has only had 38 balanced budgets.\nIn other words, if our plan was to revise our financial perspective, then we should have revised the ultraliberal ideology underpinning it, but to question the three scourges of Anglo-Saxon thinking \u2013 Malthus, Adam Smith and Ricardo \u2013 was quite another matter.", "lang": "FR", "original": "Jean-Claude Martinez (NI). - Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, sur le constat nous \u00e9tions tous d\u2019accord concernant la modestie des ces mille milliards d\u2019euros environ, cens\u00e9s couvrir sept ans du budget europ\u00e9en, alors que le budget des \u00c9tats-Unis d\u2019Am\u00e9rique, pour une seule ann\u00e9e, est de deux mille cinq cents milliards de dollars.\nDans ces conditions, affirmer \u00e0 Lisbonne que l\u2019Europe sera en 2010 l\u2019\u00e9conomie la plus comp\u00e9titive de la plan\u00e8te, c\u2019est se comporter comme Nikita Khrouchtchev qui, en 1960, \u00e0 la tribune de l\u2019ONU, disait: \u00abDans dix ans, l\u2019Union sovi\u00e9tique aura rattrap\u00e9 les \u00c9tats-Unis\u00bb.\nDonc, sous cet angle, les propositions que nous enregistrons ici, m\u00eame avec le succ\u00e8s d\u2019une poign\u00e9e de quelques milliers d\u2019euros en plus, restent tout aussi inadapt\u00e9es face au besoin d\u2019investissement, reconnu par tous, dans les laboratoires, les h\u00f4pitaux, les universit\u00e9s, les maisons de retraite, les TGV, etc. Ce qui fait que du Conseil au Parlement, on n\u2019a diverg\u00e9 que sur \u00abz\u00e9ro virgule quelque chose\u00bb de plus par rapport au PIB, parce que c\u2019est la m\u00eame inspiration qui tient en deux mots: malthusianisme pour la politique \u00e9conomique et int\u00e9grisme pour la politique budg\u00e9taire.
