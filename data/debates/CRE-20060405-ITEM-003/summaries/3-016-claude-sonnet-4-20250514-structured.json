{"speaker": "Wojciech Roszkowski,", "english": "Wojciech Roszkowski, on behalf of the UEN Group . \u2013 (PL) Mr President, when I heard just before midnight yesterday that our negotiators had reached a compromise with the Council and the Commission concerning the new Financial Perspective, I experienced contradictory reactions. On the one hand, I wished to recognise the efforts of our negotiators and all their good work. I was also much relieved that 15\u00a0months of uncertainty and dissent threatening the Union\u2019s finances had been brought to an end in this way. There was a risk that lack of a new Financial Perspective would mean us debating all the budget parameters except for compulsory expenditure on an annual basis and running permanently behind with adoption of the budget. That is the positive aspect of the situation.\nOn the other hand it must be pointed out that the new Financial Perspective certainly falls short of expectations, as it implies drastic restrictions to the redistribution of Union resources. It is anticipated that the Union\u2019s GNI will increase by about 15% between 2007 and 2013, whilst its budget will only increase by around 2% in the same period. The figures speak for themselves. Against this background, the Council\u2019s resistance to adopting our negotiators\u2019 very modest proposals amounts to pettiness.\nIt has often been said that certain political tendencies represented in this House demonstrate an incomprehensible Euroscepticism, and that this is especially the case of those originating from the new Member States. I am actually interested in establishing which of the parties are Eurosceptic and perhaps even anti-European. Might they perhaps turn out to be the governments of those states that are constantly cutting Union budget expenditure, and that believe it is possible to create more Europe for less money?\nI shall urge colleagues in the UEN\u00a0Group to support the compromise on the new Financial Perspective. Nonetheless, if we continue to regularly fall below the thresholds set in the Perspective in the annual budgets, the Union\u2019s future will be bleak indeed. I simply suggest not blaming the new Member States for such a situation. The Union\u2019s financial problems are largely due to meanness of the old Member States.\n(Applause)", "lang": "PL", "original": "Wojciech Roszkowski, w imieniu grupy UEN . \u2013 Panie Przewodnicz\u0105cy!
