{"speaker": "Francis Wurtz,", "english": "Francis Wurtz, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group . \u2013 (FR) Mr\u00a0President, Mr\u00a0Sch\u00fcssel, Mr\u00a0Barroso, my group has never advocated a thoughtless increase of the budget. What is more, we do not believe that the budget is the only instrument available to the Union when it comes to facilitating healthy growth and balanced development. Thus, it would undoubtedly be very helpful if the European Central Bank were to play a different role in this regard. Nevertheless, the budget is always the expression of a political desire. There is no point in us harbouring lofty ambitions if we reject the financial resources needed to fulfil them.\nThat is particularly true in the case of enlargement, which everyone knew, even before the start of the process, would entail legitimate costs, particularly in the context of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund. That is why even Parliament\u2019s original demands and the B\u00f6ge report seemed to us to fall a long way short of the financial needs corresponding to the commitments made. We therefore agreed with Parliament\u2019s decision to reject the European Council\u2019s cut-price compromise of last December.\nYou were right, Mr\u00a0Barroso, to point out at the time the drastic cuts that a financial perspective such as this would entail and to call for resources for education, research, the trans-European networks, cooperation and so on. From the point of view of these objectives, the 1.5% increase demanded by our negotiators was in itself extremely modest: 1.5% of 1.04% of the Union\u2019s gross national income. As far as the Council was concerned, however, that was still three times too much. Under these circumstances, my group takes the view that our credibility depends on our rejecting this farce and that, consequently, we must shoulder our responsibilities.", "lang": "FR", "original": "Francis Wurtz, au nom du groupe GUE/NGL . - Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident en exercice du Conseil, Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident de la Commission, mon groupe n\u2019a jamais pr\u00f4n\u00e9 une augmentation inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e du budget. En outre, nous ne pensons pas que le budget soit le seul instrument dont dispose l\u2019Union pour favoriser une croissance saine et un d\u00e9veloppement \u00e9quilibr\u00e9. Ainsi, il serait sans doute d\u2019un grand secours que la Banque centrale europ\u00e9enne joue un r\u00f4le diff\u00e9rent \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. N\u00e9anmoins, le budget est toujours l\u2019expression d\u2019une volont\u00e9 politique. Il est incons\u00e9quent d\u2019afficher de grandes ambitions tout en refusant les moyens financiers n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 leur r\u00e9alisation.\nC\u2019est particuli\u00e8rement vrai pour l\u2019\u00e9largissement dont chacun savait, avant m\u00eame le lancement du processus, qu\u2019il entra\u00eenerait de l\u00e9gitimes d\u00e9penses, en particulier au titre des Fonds structurels et de coh\u00e9sion. C\u2019est pourquoi m\u00eame les demandes initiales du Parlement et le rapport B\u00f6ge nous paraissaient tr\u00e8s en de\u00e7\u00e0 des besoins financiers correspondant aux engagements pris.

Mais pour le Conseil, c\u2019\u00e9tait encore trois fois trop.
