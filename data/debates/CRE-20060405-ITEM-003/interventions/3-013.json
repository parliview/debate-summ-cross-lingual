{"speaker": "Graham Watson,", "english": "Graham Watson, on behalf of the ALDE Group . \u2013 Mr President, on behalf of Liberals and Democrats I too would like to thank Mr B\u00f6ge and his team, Messrs\u00a0Mulder, Walter and Lewandowski, as well as the Austrian Presidency, for the agreement that they have reached. I hope this agreement will commend itself for approval to my group, to the House and to the Council and Commission.\nI would not pretend that my group is satisfied with the outcome. We feel that we are not providing enough money for the research and development that our Union needs for the Galileo Programme, for the trans-European networks, for lifelong learning: all of the things we should be financing properly to convince our citizens of the added value of the Union.\nWe know that it is fashionable in the national capitals of some of our Member States to pour cold water on common endeavour. It started with the letter to Mr Prodi from six Heads of State and Government two years ago, envisaging reducing the budget to 1% of GNI\u00a0\u2013 a deeply corrosive policy. But if the centripetal force for our Union is no longer coming from visionary leadership within, it will certainly come from developments beyond our borders. I hope that our Member States will use the review of EU financing that they have agreed on to look again at providing our Union with the resources it needs.\nOur group hopes, too, that we can make progress \u2013 as suggested by the Council \u2013 towards a proper statement of assurance, so that the auditors can finally sign off the accounts for the Union. That is, it seems to us, a minimum for regaining public confidence.\n(Applause)", "lang": "EN", "original": "Graham Watson, on behalf of the ALDE Group . \u2013 Mr President, on behalf of Liberals and Democrats I too would like to thank Mr B\u00f6ge and his team, Messrs\u00a0Mulder, Walter and Lewandowski, as well as the Austrian Presidency, for the agreement that they have reached.
