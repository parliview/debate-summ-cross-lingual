{"speaker": "Margot Wallstr\u00f6m,", "english": "Margot Wallstr\u00f6m, Vice-President of the Commission . Mr President, we bring this document and annual policy strategy to the European Parliament in order to receive your input and ideas on how to improve it. We therefore listen to you very carefully. We have already heard a number of points that would improve our paper. The same goes for the discussion I had with the Conference of Committee Chairmen. This will give us a lot, since we are able to have a truly political discussion about our priorities, the balance we want to achieve and the messages we want to send.\nI think we are coming back to the fact that we want to achieve results and we want to win trust. These are basic and core conditions for us in order to build a stronger European Union. Whatever title we choose, there will be linguistic or other problems with it. I am not sure we will ever be able to find something on which everybody agrees. However, our aim is that, by showing good results and by delivering on our commitments, we will also be able to build trust. If we engage in a democratic discussion and debate with citizens, it will also be easier to explain why we need constitutional reform in order to achieve those good results. That is the way we have to go: we have to engage with citizens in a democratic manner.\nI am very happy to have the opportunity to tell all the people in the UK that church organ pipes are not covered by the directive on electronic and electrical waste. You can fill all your churches with as many leaded pipes as you want. The Commission will not interfere with that. Just make sure that now and then the poor people in the UK hear the truth, as they rarely receive correct information. You can rest absolutely assured that the directive does not cover church organ pipes.\nI also hope we can open up the Council meetings. The Finnish Presidency is now preparing to make that a reality, and this will definitely help to end the blame game. If citizens can follow what their ministers do in the Council \u2013 the kinds of positions they take and statements they make, if they are there at all \u2013 it will help to end the blame game. Acting in partnership, we will all have to explain what the European Union does and what it is. Perhaps we can make some progress. I hope that during the Austrian Presidency we have made progress, because this is also a concern of yours. Definitely under the Finnish Presidency, where we can take it a step further, we should make progress.\nThank you for all your wise comments on the annual policy strategy. I will definitely take all your comments back with me and pass them on to all the other Commissioners.\n(Applause)", "lang": "EN", "original": "Margot Wallstr\u00f6m, Vice-President of the Commission .
