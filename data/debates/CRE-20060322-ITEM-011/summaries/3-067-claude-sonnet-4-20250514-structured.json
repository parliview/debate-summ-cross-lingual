{"speaker": "Guntars Krasts,", "english": "Guntars Krasts, on behalf of the UEN Group . \u2013 (LV) In order to reduce the gulf between the European Union\u2019s Lisbon targets and reality, the Commission\u2019s programme of work for 2007 needs to be ambitious. Action by the Commission ought to cover all spheres, and at the same time it should choose as its priorities those initiatives that are important not only in one specific sector but also for the overall development of the European Union.\nIn the Commission\u2019s programme, the launching of the space programme and the regular evaluation of strategy were among the most important measures mentioned for the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy in 2007. While not contesting the importance of these measures, I believe that specific measures to foster the development of small and medium-sized enterprises and the development of the services sector would offer broader support to the Lisbon process, but such measures were not included in the list. Although the development of small and medium-sized enterprises appears among the priorities listed, this priority is not reflected at all in the list of principal actions. It is the development of this sector, however, that can actually make the most rapid contribution to achieving the goals of employment and growth. Although the development of the services sector is and remains one of the main instruments for implementing the Lisbon Strategy in the Commission\u2019s strategy for 2007, no specific measures for the development of the services sector are mentioned. We hope that it was not as a result of a deliberate move, but of a failure to coordinate the strategy established with operational measures, that the reform of the services sector was not included in the Commission\u2019s policy strategy for 2006.\nThe adoption of the Services Directive in 2007 will also clear the way for new initiatives by the European Commission in sectors that have been identified for liberalisation of services. The creation of one-stop agencies would be one specific move in this direction.\n2007 will be decisive for debates about the future of the European Union. One of the main criteria according to which the European public will judge the European Union\u2019s viability and future prospects in 2007 will be the concrete results of action taken by the European Union\u2019s institutions, including the Commission. This specificity ought, however, to be already apparent in the setting out of priorities and tasks, by defining the measures planned for 2007 not only in terms of continuing work already begun but also in terms of achieving concrete results.", "lang": "LV", "original": "Guntars Krasts, UEN grupas v\u0101rd\u0101 . \u2013 Lai mazin\u0101tu plaisu starp Eiropas Savien\u012bbas Lisabonas m\u0113r\u0137iem un realit\u0101ti, Komisijas darba pl\u0101niem 2007. gadam j\u0101b\u016bt ambicioziem.
