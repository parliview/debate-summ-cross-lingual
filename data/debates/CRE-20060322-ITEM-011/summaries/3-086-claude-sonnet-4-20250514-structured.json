I find it hard to imagine why the European Commission, which declares the simplification of regulation as its aim, is not changing its own structures, not reorganising the work of its institutions, which after all create those complex documents. These things are simply incomprehensible and inconsistent. Let me give you a simple example. Recently a delegation of Lithuanian lecturers paid a visit. They went around various directorates hoping to acquire information on the work of a directorate. Everywhere they were given the same information. And the Commissioner who came to our Budget Committee even said that not all funds are used for public relations and publicity campaigns. But all work is duplicated. The Lithuanian lecturers were quite astonished. We absolutely must do something with the reform of the European Commission's work. The European Parliament at least is showing some initiative and aims to reform its work, so that we can implement those ambitious goals. I always regret the fact that we do not draw upon the experience of the new countries. We, the new countries, really understand that, first of all, we must reform our institutions. I trust that the European Commission will present a reform programme for its government structure as soon as possible.", "lang": "LT", "original": "Margarita Starkevi\u010di\u016bt\u0117 (ALDE). \u2013 I\u0161 savo \u0161alies reform\u0173 patirties galiu pasakyti tvirtai tik vien\u0105 dalyk\u0105: jokios ekonomin\u0117s, politin\u0117s programos negalima \u012fgyvendinti, jeigu n\u0117ra vykdoma pa\u010di\u0173 institucij\u0173 reforma.
