{"speaker": "Jan Tadeusz Masiel (NI).", "english": "Jan Tadeusz Masiel (NI). \u2013 (PL) Mr President, President of the Commission, 2005 will unfortunately be remembered by Europeans as the year in which the Constitutional Treaty was rejected in two of the EU\u2019s founding Member States. This should serve as a warning to us politicians that we are paying insufficient attention to our citizens. The European Union has not yet managed to become unified following its most recent enlargement to include 10 new Member States, and yet it is already preparing for the future accession of Turkey.\nThe year 2007 could be a year of opportunity in terms of achieving a more unified Europe that demonstrates more solidarity if the old Member States open up towards the new Member States, particularly as regards liberalising their labour markets. Unfortunately there appear to be few countries with the courage of Spain and Portugal, which know from their own recent experience how difficult it is to be a second-class citizen in the European Union. I propose that any future enlargement of the European Union should either be full, or that it should not happen at all. I hope that in saying this I am also reflecting the will of the people of the Netherlands and France. It is not yet too late to deepen European unity by ensuring that it has a budget that lives up to its ambitions.\n2006 has drawn the attention of Europeans to the problem of energy supplies. Today more than ever, Europe needs a common energy policy. This would provide a good opportunity to improve the prospects of farmers, particularly in the new Member States, who could become involved in biofuel production.\nThe worldwide process of globalisation is inevitable. Europe should regard it as a new challenge and as a development opportunity. It is our duty to help developing countries, but also to enhance our European social model and to care for those of our citizens who are least able to look after themselves.", "lang": "PL", "original": "Jan Tadeusz Masiel (NI). \u2013 Panie Przewodnicz\u0105cy, Panie Przewodnicz\u0105cy Komisji Europejskiej!
