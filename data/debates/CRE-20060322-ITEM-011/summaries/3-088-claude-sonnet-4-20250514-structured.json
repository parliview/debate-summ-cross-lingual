I think this strategy is quite good. The Commission is coming forward with this at a very opportune time, when there is an atmosphere of nationalism and protectionism. As a matter of fact, unlike many of the strategies that you have provided before, Mr Barroso \u2013 I would call them \u2018nato\u2019: no action talk only \u2013 this one has a lot of action.\nHowever, I agree with Mr Harbour that you might want to come up with an alternative name. You call this document \u2013 not necessarily very aptly \u2013 \u2018boosting trust through action\u2019. Perhaps you should seek some advice from an advertising agency before you come up with the next branding. It is a tough thing to do but that is not going to do it.\nThe second point is that I agree with the focus on communication. Mrs Wallstr\u00f6m, you of course play a very important part in doing that. We do not have a democratic deficit, we do not have an information deficit \u2013 we have almost too much of it \u2013 but we do have a communication deficit. The paper that you put forward on European communication is quite good. We have big problems: John Bowis was talking about church organs a second ago and of course we know that it is utter rubbish. However, when respectable broadsheets like The Independent come up with headlines like \u2018EU forces you to recycle dildos\u2019, then you are in trouble. It was about a directive on electrical appliances: if you take the appliance back to a store, it must be recycled. However, it is this type of communication that we really need to get rid of.\nThe final point I wanted to make is that the EU is very often used as a scapegoat. Everything that is bad comes out of the EU, everything that is good comes from the Member States. Therefore, I would encourage you, Mrs\u00a0Wallstr\u00f6m, to focus more on communication on the Constitution. It is a good Constitution, we need it; keep it alive until spring 2007 and let us see what happens after that.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Alexander Stubb (PPE-DE). \u2013 Mr President, I would like to make three points.\nThe first point is that I am actually playing the \u2018good cop\u2019 as opposed to the \u2018bad cop\u2019 like Malcolm Harbour.
