{"speaker": "Jens-Peter Bonde,", "english": "Jens-Peter Bonde, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. \u2013 (DA) Mr\u00a0President, the Commission has broken a clear pledge to present a full annual programme, setting out all proposed legislation and its legal bases. As yet, we have received details of only a small selection of the laws and regulations produced by the Commission. We have not been given precise information about the legal bases, so we cannot see whether the Commission is proposing voluntary coordination or binding rules. It is difficult to debate strategic guidelines in the dark. Does the Commission want more power, centralism and Byzantine regulation, or does it want to inspire the Member States to pull together in the interests of job creation and to encourage countries to compete in doing things as best they can?\nThe Independence and Democracy Group wants greater freedom for the Member States and less power centralised in Brussels. The Commission must be open with people. Tell us who is giving good advice in your 3\u00a0000 secret working parties. Let us see what is behind the advice. Tell us how you use taxpayers\u2019 money. Give the EU\u2019s auditors, the ombudsman and the European Parliament\u2019s Committee on Budgetary Control full access to investigate all expenditure. Put your mail on the Internet so that we can study all approaches from lobbyists. Show some confidence in people. Give us the information we request, unless there is, exceptionally, a sound argument for excluding public discussion.\nMay I also thank the President for quoting Montesquieu. He too was in favour of the threefold division of power, although not in a way that corresponds fully to the Commission\u2019s mix of legislative, executive and judicial powers. It seems to me that Machiavelli was more of an inspiration than Montesquieu when the Commission\u2019s powers were designed.", "lang": "DA", "original": "Jens-Peter Bonde, for IND/DEM-Gruppen . - Hr. formand Kommissionen har brudt et klart l\u00f8fte om at freml\u00e6gge et komplet \u00e5rsprogram med angivelse af alle forslag til love og deres juridiske basis. Vi har endnu kun modtaget et lille udpluk af de love og forordninger, som Kommissionen barsler med. Vi har ikke f\u00e5et pr\u00e6cis angivelse af den retlige hjemmel, dermed kan vi ikke se, om Kommissionen l\u00e6gger op til frivillig koordination eller bindende regler. Og det er sv\u00e6rt at diskutere strategiske retningslinjer i blinde. \u00d8nsker Kommissionen mere magt, \"regulereri\" og centralisme eller \u00f8nsker Kommissionen at inspirere medlemslandene til at l\u00f8fte i flok for besk\u00e6ftigelse og opmuntre landene til at konkurrere om at g\u00f8re det bedst muligt?\nGruppen for Uafh\u00e6ngighed og Demokrati \u00f8nsker st\u00f8rre frihed for medlemslandene og mindre magt centraliseret i Bruxelles.

Fort\u00e6l os, hvordan I anvender skatteborgernes penge. Giv EU's revisorer, ombudsmanden og Europa-Parlamentets Budgetkontroludvalg fuldt adgang til at unders\u00f8ge alle udgifter.

Giv os den information, vi beder om, medmindre der undtagelsesvis er et godt argument for at lukke offentligheden ude.\nM\u00e5 jeg s\u00e5 ikke takke formanden for at citere Montesquieu. Det var ogs\u00e5 ham, der gik ind for magtens tredeling, som ikke helt svarer til Kommissionens sammenblanding af lovgivende, ud\u00f8vende og d\u00f8mmende bef\u00f8jelser.
