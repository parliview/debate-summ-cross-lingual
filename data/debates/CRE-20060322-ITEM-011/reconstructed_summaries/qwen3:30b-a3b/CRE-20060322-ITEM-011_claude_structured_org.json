The user provided a parliamentary debate summary from 2007 about the European Commission's Annual Policy Strategy. The task is to extract the main points of the speaker named \"President.\" \n\nFirst, I need to figure out who the President is in this context. The debate summary mentions Commission President Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso. So, the speaker in question is Barroso.\n\nLooking at the debate summary, the Executive Summary under \"Commission's Strategic Vision\" states that Barroso outlined priorities for 2007, emphasizing sustainable growth, more jobs, and reducing red tape. He mentioned the importance of the year for prosperity, solidarity, and security through better regulation, completing financial perspectives, and preparing for the Treaty of Rome's 50th anniversary.\n\nNow, I need to structure the response into the four categories: issueSum, positionSum, argSum, propSum. \n\nFor issueSum, the key issues would be the strategic priorities like growth, jobs, energy policy, institutional reforms, and EU enlargement. But since the user wants only the points attributed to the President, I should focus on what Barroso mentioned. The summary says he emphasized sustainable growth, reducing red tape, and the importance of the year for certain goals.\n\nPositionSum would be his positions: supporting the Commission's ambitions, stressing the need for better regulation, completing financial perspectives, and preparing for the Treaty's anniversary. \n\nArgSum would be the arguments he used. The summary mentions he argued that Europe needs a red carpet, not red tape, implying that reducing regulations is crucial for business. Also, he positioned the year as crucial for achieving prosperity, etc.\n\nPropSum would be the proposals or policy actions. The summary says he called for better regulation, completing financial perspectives, and preparing for the Treaty's 50th anniversary. However, the exact proposals might be more specific. The example given in the user's instruction includes things like \"strict limitations on government demands,\" but in this case, the President's proposals are about regulatory improvements and financial planning.\n\nWait, the user's example response includes \"He advocates for strict limitations on government demands for private data,\" but in the debate summary, Barroso's points are about reducing red tape, better regulation, financial perspectives, and the Treaty. So the propSum should reflect those.\n\nI need to make sure not to include other speakers' points. The user mentioned that contributions from others should not be included. So only Barroso's points.\n\nNow, structuring each section:\n\nissueSum: The key issues related to the Commission's strategic priorities for 2007, including growth, jobs, energy policy, institutional reforms, and EU enlargement.\n\npositionSum: The President's positions on these issues, emphasizing sustainable growth, reducing regulatory burdens, and preparing for the Treaty of Rome's 50th anniversary.\n\nargSum: The arguments he used, such as the need for a red carpet (less regulation) for businesses and the importance of the year for achieving prosperity, solidarity, and security.\n\npropSum: The proposals he mentioned, like improving regulation, completing financial perspectives, and preparing for the Treaty's anniversary.\n\nI need to check if the original summary mentions any specific proposals. The summary says he positioned the year as crucial for achieving prosperity, solidarity, and security through better regulation, completion of financial perspectives, and preparation for the Treaty. So the proposals are about better regulation, completing financial perspectives, and preparing for the Treaty.\n\nSo putting it all together in JSON format without markdown. Ensure that each field is a summary of the respective points, using the speaker's own words where possible.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The key issues include the European Commission's strategic priorities for 2007, focusing on sustainable growth, job creation, energy policy, institutional reforms, and EU enlargement.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"Commission President Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso emphasized the need for sustainable growth and job creation, advocating for reduced regulatory burdens on businesses and highlighting the importance of the year for achieving prosperity, solidarity, and security in Europe.\",\n\"argSum\": \"Barroso argued that reducing red tape (\\\"a red carpet, not red tape\\\") is essential for business growth and that the year 2007 is critical for fulfilling the EU's ambitions through better regulation, financial planning, and preparations for the Treaty of Rome's 50th anniversary.\",\n\"propSum\": \"He proposed improving regulation, completing financial perspectives, and preparing for the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome to ensure the EU's prosperity and cohesion.\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso,", "english": "Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, President of the Commission . (FR) Mr\u00a0President, ladies and gentlemen, our debate today consists of taking stock and planning for the future, as well as finding a consensus regarding the priority actions for 2007. It is a question of working together so that we can properly prepare the ground for future actions.\nThe Commission has placed the effective implementation of its policies at the heart of its objectives, but if we are to implement them effectively we need a genuine partnership between the European institutions. The 2005 report shows that the caricature of a Europe in the grip of paralysis was far removed from reality. We have in actual fact made considerable progress. The Commission has focused on its objectives and has achieved a rate of implementation of nearly 90% for its priority actions. The Stability and Growth Pact, the revised social agenda and the sustainable development strategy have been steered in a new direction. Above all, however, I believe that, this week, we will see that the revision of the Lisbon Strategy on employment and growth has been a turning point in terms of finally providing the strategy with the tools it needs to turn aspirations into reality.\nThe Hampton Court Summit helped achieve a new consensus on the key elements of the Union\u2019s action in a world that is heading in the direction of globalisation. It opened the door to the measures that are emerging today. I am thinking, for instance, of European energy policy and of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund.\nThe Union demonstrated its ability to respond rapidly to people\u2019s needs after the tsunami and the London bombings. It has also shown that it is capable of working as one body, with the European consensus on development, to which the European Parliament itself also subscribes, being the expression of a genuine common approach. Admittedly, our task is not complete. As far as the financial perspective is concerned, however, I believe that we are closer than ever to reaching an agreement. If we find a solution very soon, then we will still have enough time to get under way with implementing most of the programmes at the start of next year, something that is particularly important for the less wealthy countries and regions of our continent.\nAs for the future of the European debate, we can still take advantage of the events and make use of that period in order to find a genuine consensus regarding which direction we need to take. I believe that we are on the right track: the annual progress report on the Lisbon Strategy, the Green Paper on energy policy, biofuels, the European Institute of Technology and the road map in the field of gender equality are so many major initiatives that are already on the agenda.\nSo, what about 2007?\nI believe that 2007 will be a crucial year in terms of achieving the strategic objectives set by our Commission for its term of office. Our strategic objectives over five years \u2013 prosperity, solidarity and security \u2013 and, of course, their influence outside the EU remain fully relevant. They form a coherent political framework designed to guide the action of the European Union. They reflect the challenges facing Europe and the main anxieties of Europeans, which they strive to address. They will remain the cornerstone of the Commission\u2019s action. I believe in fact that they constitute a sound basis from which to re-assess the direction that our Union must take. With the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome coming up in 2007, attention will rightly be focused on the great values and the general objectives of the European Union.\nThe main target must continue to be sustainable growth to provide more and better jobs in Europe. With a more positive macroeconomic outlook, we must seize every opportunity to accelerate reforms and put them into practice. I know that this Parliament is committed to playing its role in a real partnership for growth and jobs.\nIn 2007, several Member States should be speeding up their preparations for adopting the euro. Provided they meet the necessary conditions, in 2007 we shall see the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, and I look forward to their contribution to the European Union.\nEnergy will continue to attract our attention. We will pay special attention to the promotion of sustainable management and the protection of natural resources. We will make proposals for a European Union maritime policy. We will follow up on the Green Paper on labour law. The year 2007 will also be the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All. In the field of security and freedom, the main target will be the extension of the Schengen area, migration and border controls and the fight against crime. Health issues will remain central, with greater preventive efforts against pandemics. Beyond our borders, we will ensure a proper follow-up to the Doha Round, progress in the stabilisation of the western Balkans \u2013 in particular in Kosovo \u2013 and completion of partnership agreements with the ACP countries.\nAs you can see, we will be very busy in 2007. The year 2007 will also see new directions for the second half of the Commission\u2019s mandate. We shall be preparing for the future, with intensive work on the comprehensive review of the Union\u2019s budget leading to a White Paper in 2008-2009. This review needs to be based on a profound reflection and must take the full range of views into account. This will naturally include the European Parliament and I welcome your intention of close association with this process.\nLet me also say a few words on our ability to deliver on these priorities. We need to translate them into practical actions and implement them through the most appropriate instruments. The Commission has made progress in this direction. Firstly, we have a strategic planning and programming cycle ensuring an effective and timely delivery of our priorities and concentrating our resources on these tasks. The Commission states its intentions, consults on them, adopts its work programme and reports regularly on its implementation. However, we need to further strengthen the political relevance and substance of our discussion on our strategic planning and programming.\nSecondly, we have implemented a range of instruments to promote better regulation and good governance, which I believe is having a real impact on the rigour of our work and the quality of our output. We have made significant efforts to carry out impact assessments on our major proposals. We have completed more than one hundred so far, and we will continue to improve their quality and ensure that they make a real difference in our decision-making process.\nThe Commission will also carry through its simplification agenda, covering various fields from environment to industry, the modernisation of labour law, the promotion of consumer rights or key internal market sectors. However, let us not forget that governance and better regulation are the shared responsibilities of all the European institutions and the Member States. As I have said before, better regulation is crucially important for liberalising our economic potential, in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises. What our business needs in Europe is a red carpet, not red tape. Efforts must be pursued at all levels to show that European initiatives are well founded and add real value. In many areas \u2013 be it at European or national level \u2013 we do not need so many regulations.\nAs Montesquieu said \u2013 in the best possible way \u2013 and I shall say it in French:\n\u2018 Les lois inutiles affaiblissent les lois n\u00e9cessaires \u2019.\nRoughly translated, that means \u2018useless laws weaken indispensable ones\u2019. This is the very principle of the good European tradition.\nSo what are the next steps? The annual policy strategy decision forms the basis for our dialogue in view of preparing the Commission\u2019s work programme for 2007. Every Commissioner now stands ready to discuss with committees the political priorities put forward in her or his area. It is crucial to take time away from the topic of the day in order to prepare for the future. I very much welcomed Parliament\u2019s initiative last year to draw together the threads in its report. That had a real impact on this year\u2019s work programme.\nMr President, honourable members, the Commission puts this strategy forward in a spirit of partnership. I look forward to your views on where Europe should devote its energies in 2007.\n(Applause)", "lang": "EN", "original": "Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, President of the Commission .

The executive summary mentions that Commission President Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso outlined ambitious priorities. The key points he mentioned were \"sustainable growth to provide more and better jobs in Europe\" and the idea that Europe needs a \"red carpet, not red tape.\" He also positioned 2007 as crucial for prosperity, solidarity, and security through better regulation, completing financial perspectives, and preparing for the Treaty of Rome's 50th anniversary.\n\nNow, the user wants the main points or arguments made by Barroso. The challenge is to extract only his contributions without including others. The example response structure requires issueSum, positionSum, argSum, propSum.\n\nFor issueSum, the main issue he raised is the need for sustainable growth and job creation. PositionSum would be his emphasis on reducing red tape and promoting a business-friendly environment. The arguments he used are the need for prosperity, solidarity, security through better regulation and financial planning. His proposals include focusing on regulation, financial perspectives, and the Treaty of Rome anniversary.\n\nI need to make sure not to include other speakers' points.

Without either the interinstitutional agreement or the financial perspective for the moment, where do we go from here? We are in a situation that I would describe as complete hypocrisy. We want to debate actions that are important for Europeans, while, for its part, the Council, ever deaf to our arguments, is proposing practically no budgetary development. Our Parliament will not give up on the financial perspective. The needs are huge: youth training, research, transport, health programmes, the environment; a full list would be too long.

I am pleased, moreover, to see that the European Commission is finally recognising that economic cohesion, solidarity and environmental protection can be reconciled with our objectives regarding growth and employment.\nYou propose four priority areas: knowledge, businesses \u2013 and specifically SMEs \u2013 employment and ageing and, lastly, energy. We must in fact represent the best of the knowledge-based society. We can see what is happening in Asia and we must not remain helpless in the face of it. The European Union will only cope if it rises to the challenge posed by knowledge, knowledge that takes the form of technical and industrial developments. As regards SMEs, we must create a competitive regulatory environment and help our businesses to gain a better foothold in international markets.\nYou also intend to do away with the European laws that serve no purpose, those notorious useless laws that you just mentioned to us, which weaken the necessary laws. We totally agree with you, Mr\u00a0Barroso, and our Parliament plans to be closely involved in the decisions taken to simplify legislation. Being simple, however, also means expressing oneself clearly. You want to make 2007 an important year where communication is concerned, and I approve of your ambition. Coining new words, however, has never been part of a good communication strategy. In the context of the main priority, that of employment, you introduce an awful word, \u2018flexisecurity\u2019. What does that mean? Europeans are going to run away faced with that highly technocratic word. \u2018Brussels has invented yet another forgettable word\u2019 \u2013 that is what we are in danger of hearing.\nEnergy is the fundamental issue. The year 2007 will have to be a decisive one where the guidelines on energy policy are concerned. We will have to be objective, disregard all ideologies, no longer treat nuclear power as a taboo subject and keep in mind that our energy dependence must never exceed 50%. As we have seen recently, energy is becoming a genuine weapon with which to exert political pressure. Furthermore, if, in the future, a non-EU country decides to cut the supply and plunge Europe into darkness, how will we respond? We therefore need to improve the means of transporting energy and to think, first and foremost, about solidarity among the Member States.\nIn the area of security and freedoms, the extension of the Schengen area worries our fellow citizens. They still have the impression that our borders remain porous and that the debate on immigration is still at the stage of wishful thinking. The future enlargement to incorporate Romania and Bulgaria will have to be decided in the course of this year. While I am on that subject, we note with interest your indispensable condition: that those countries will have to comply in full with the acquis communautaire. Moreover, if the neighbourhood policy becomes a policy in its own right, then I regret that more is not being done in terms of establishing the strategic partnership.\nThe 2007-2013 period will also mark the launch of new European programmes. There will be a large number of them, and, if we are to launch them, then we need the financial perspective. We are only too familiar with the debate on Erasmus. Finally, we will pay a great deal of attention to the preparation of your White Paper on the reform of the EU budget. We ask you to involve our Parliament in this task.\nThe year 2007 will mark the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome. Might not this be an opportunity, on the one hand, to see the European Constitution enter into operation and, on the other, to make 2007 the year of Europe in all of the Member States, so that the double standards stop at last and so that the truth can be told about how Europe benefits people\u2019s everyday lives?", "lang": "FR", "original": "Fran\u00e7oise Grosset\u00eate, au nom du groupe PPE-DE . - Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident de la Commission, chers coll\u00e8gues, en 2005, les citoyens europ\u00e9ens ont eu l\u2019occasion de nous dire qu\u2019ils attendaient beaucoup de nous, mais aussi qu\u2019ils s\u2019interrogeaient sur leur avenir et sur celui de l\u2019Europe dans un contexte de globalisation.\nLa strat\u00e9gie politique pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2007 doit nous permettre d\u2019apporter les bonnes r\u00e9ponses.

Notre Parlement ne c\u00e9dera pas sur les perspectives financi\u00e8res.

Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, vous nous parlez d\u2019un prochain accord possible, mais je ne vous ai pas entendu prononcer le mot ambitieux, un accord ambitieux, alors je reste sceptique.\nDans le dialogue qui s\u2019ouvre entre nous, vous pouvez compter sur le dynamisme de notre Assembl\u00e9e pour formuler ses priorit\u00e9s politiques pour 2007. Je suis heureuse, d\u2019ailleurs, de voir que la Commission europ\u00e9enne prend enfin conscience que la coh\u00e9sion \u00e9conomique, la solidarit\u00e9, la protection de l\u2019environnement sont conciliables avec nos objectifs en mati\u00e8re de croissance et d\u2019emploi.\nVous proposez quatre domaines prioritaires: la connaissance, les entreprises, et en particulier les PME, l\u2019emploi et le vieillissement, et enfin l\u2019\u00e9nergie. Nous devons effectivement repr\u00e9senter le meilleur de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de la connaissance. Nous voyons ce qui se passe en Asie et nous ne devons pas rester les bras ballants. L\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne ne s\u2019en sortira que si elle rel\u00e8ve le d\u00e9fi du savoir, d\u2019un savoir qui se concr\u00e9tise par des \u00e9volutions techniques et industrielles. En ce qui concerne les PME, nous devons cr\u00e9er un environnement r\u00e9glementaire comp\u00e9titif et aider nos entreprises \u00e0 mieux se positionner sur les march\u00e9s mondiaux.\nVous entendez aussi poursuivre le nettoyage des lois europ\u00e9ennes superflues, les fameuses lois inutiles dont vous venez de nous parler, qui affaiblissent les lois n\u00e9cessaires. Nous sommes tout \u00e0 fait d\u2019accord avec vous, Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, et notre Parlement entend \u00eatre \u00e9troitement associ\u00e9 aux d\u00e9cisions de simplification. Mais \u00eatre simple, c\u2019est aussi s\u2019exprimer clairement. Vous voulez faire de 2007 une ann\u00e9e importante de la communication et je partage votre ambition. Mais le n\u00e9ologisme n\u2019a jamais fait partie d\u2019une bonne strat\u00e9gie de communication. Or, dans le cadre de la priorit\u00e9 principale, celle de l\u2019emploi, vous mettez en avant un mot barbare, la \u00abflexs\u00e9curit\u00e9\u00bb. Qu\u2019est-ce que cela veut dire? Les citoyens vont fuir devant ce mot hautement technocratique. Bruxelles a encore invent\u00e9 un machin, voil\u00e0 ce que l\u2019on risque d\u2019entendre.\nL\u2019\u00e9nergie est la question fondamentale. L\u2019ann\u00e9e 2007 devra \u00eatre d\u00e9cisive pour les orientations de la politique \u00e9nerg\u00e9tique. Il nous faudra \u00eatre objectif, faire fi de toute id\u00e9ologie, ne plus avoir de tabous sur le nucl\u00e9aire, avoir \u00e0 l\u2019esprit que, jamais, notre d\u00e9pendance \u00e9nerg\u00e9tique ne doit d\u00e9passer les 50\u00a0%. Nous l\u2019avons vu r\u00e9cemment, l\u2019\u00e9nergie devient une v\u00e9ritable arme de pression politique. Et si, demain, un \u00c9tat ext\u00e9rieur d\u00e9cide de couper l\u2019approvisionnement, de plonger l\u2019Europe dans le noir, quelle sera notre r\u00e9ponse? Il faut donc am\u00e9liorer les modes de transport de l\u2019\u00e9nergie et penser, surtout, \u00e0 la solidarit\u00e9 entre les \u00c9tats membres.\nDans le domaine de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et des libert\u00e9s, l\u2019extension de l\u2019espace Schengen inqui\u00e8te nos concitoyens. Ils ont toujours l\u2019impression que nos fronti\u00e8res restent perm\u00e9ables et que le d\u00e9bat sur l\u2019immigration en est encore au stade du v\u0153u pieu. Le futur \u00e9largissement \u00e0 la Roumanie et \u00e0 la Bulgarie devra se d\u00e9cider dans le courant de cette ann\u00e9e. Et, \u00e0 ce propos, nous notons, avec int\u00e9r\u00eat, votre condition sine qua none: ces pays devront respecter pleinement l\u2019acquis communautaire. Par ailleurs, si la politique de voisinage devient une politique \u00e0 part enti\u00e8re, je regrette que l\u2019on n\u2019aille pas plus loin dans la d\u00e9finition du partenariat strat\u00e9gique.\nLa p\u00e9riode 2007-2013 marquera \u00e9galement le lancement de nouveaux programmes europ\u00e9ens, ils seront nombreux, et pour cela il nous faut les perspectives financi\u00e8res.

That is what I want to speak about.\nWe are all in broad agreement, Mr Barroso, about the content of what you have said and what you have presented in writing. A revised Lisbon Strategy? Of course! Defining Europe\u2019s role in the globalised world as regards migration? Fine! A key challenge! Improving Europe\u2019s energy supply, greater energy efficiency, greater energy security? Unity throughout the House! Promoting technology, investing in the technologies of the future to preserve and enhance Europe\u2019s global competitiveness as a knowledge-based continent? Agreed! Strengthening internal security and expanding Europe\u2019s role in international security? Agreed! Wonderful! Great! We will hear many more speakers today saying, \u2018this is just what we need! Mr Barroso is right, that is the way forward!\u2019\nWhat we have not been given, however, is a Financial Perspective to match, that is the necessary resources to achieve that. We haggle with the Council \u2013 Mrs\u00a0Grosset\u00eate is right there \u2013 for a billion more or less. The bold approach which you and your Commissioners pushed for when presenting your Financial Perspective, Mr Barroso, was cut by EUR 200 billion in the European Council. You asked for EUR 1\u00a0022 billion for seven years, the Council decided on EUR 840 billion.\nI wondered what happened to Mr Barroso\u2019s strategic outcry against such incorrect financial policy. You told this Parliament you would fight for these strategic objectives with this financial allocation. And then you told Parliament the Council\u2019s decision was a success. There is nothing else you can do, I understand that, because you will not get any more money, at least not unless we fight a bit more for it. As Commission President, you have to live with the stupidity of the Heads of State or Government. My criticism is therefore directed not so much at you and your Commission as at the partners on the other side.\nWe will not achieve these strategic objectives if we define the objectives without making the necessary resources available to the institutions that have to act. That is certain! That is why I am saying that the Commission\u2019s strategic objectives are the right ones, but you must also argue the matter with the individual States! As President of the Commission you must call a spade a spade! In every single case, you and your Commissioners must go and say that we cannot announce we are going to give Europol more power, that we can fight terrorism and crime more efficiently at European level \u2013 incidentally, the joint fight against crime and greater internal security are the European matters getting the highest rate of approval from Europe\u2019s citizens \u2013 and then have the Council cut the appropriations by EUR 7.8 billion \u2013 and that three days before adopting the additional programme for Europol that sounds so good in the newspaper.\nYour strategic objectives are the right ones. But the Commission must take up the cudgels with those Heads of State or Government, with those ministers and councils of ministers, that are not willing to pay the price on Monday for the speeches they made on Sunday. I expect the Commission to do that. You can expect us to support your strategic objectives \u2013 you have named the right strategic objectives \u2013 but we expect you to stand at our side in our battle, as Parliament, with the Heads of State or Government for a little more credibility for European policy.\nIf we agree this together for 2007, it will be an exciting year and I am sure a successful one for the European institutions.\n(Applause)", "lang": "DE", "original": "Martin Schulz, im Namen der PSE-Fraktion . \u2013 Herr Pr\u00e4sident, meine sehr geehrten Damen und Herren!

Da hat er Recht, der Herr Barroso, so m\u00fcssen wir vorgehen!\nEine entsprechende Finanzielle Vorausschau, das hei\u00dft, die notwendigen Mittel, um dies zu erreichen, bekommen wir jedoch nicht. Wir feilschen mit dem Rat \u2013 da hat die Kollegin Grosset\u00eate Recht \u2013 um eine Milliarde rauf oder runter. Der mutige Ansatz, den Sie, Herr Kommissionspr\u00e4sident, mit Ihren Kommissarinnen und Kommissaren bei der Vorlage Ihrer Finanziellen Vorausschau propagiert haben, ist auf dem Europ\u00e4ischen Rat um 200 Milliarden Euro gekappt worden. Sie haben 1,\u00a0022\u00a0Billionen Euro f\u00fcr sieben Jahre gefordert, der Rat hat 840 Milliarden Euro beschlossen.\nIch habe mich gefragt, wo hier der strategische Aufschrei von Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso gegen eine solche falsche Finanzpolitik bleibt. Sie haben vor diesem Parlament gesagt: Ich k\u00e4mpfe f\u00fcr diese strategischen Ziele mit dieser Finanzausstattung. Und Sie haben anschlie\u00dfend vor dem Parlament gesagt: Der Beschluss des Rates ist ein Erfolg. Sie k\u00f6nnen nicht anders \u2013 ich habe Verst\u00e4ndnis daf\u00fcr\u00a0\u2013, weil Sie nicht mehr Geld bekommen, zumindest nicht, wenn wir nicht noch ein bisschen daf\u00fcr k\u00e4mpfen. Denn Sie als Kommissionspr\u00e4sident m\u00fcssen auch mit der Unvernunft der Staats- und Regierungschefs leben. Deshalb richte ich meine Kritik gar nicht so sehr an Sie und Ihre Kommission, sondern an den Partner auf der anderen Seite.\nWir werden diese strategischen Ziele nicht erreichen, wenn wir einerseits die Ziele definieren, aber andererseits den handelnden Institutionen die notwendigen Finanzmittel nicht zur Verf\u00fcgung stellen. Das steht fest! Deshalb sage ich: Die strategischen Ziele der Kommission sind die richtigen, aber Sie m\u00fcssen sich auch mit den einzelnen Staaten anlegen! Sie m\u00fcssen als Pr\u00e4sident der Kommission die Dinge beim Namen nennen! Sie m\u00fcssen mit Ihren Kommissarinnen und Kommissaren in jedem einzelnen Fall hingehen und sagen, dass man nicht propagieren kann: Wir statten Europol mit mehr Macht aus, wir bek\u00e4mpfen Terrorismus und Kriminalit\u00e4t in effizienterer Art und Weise auf europ\u00e4ischer Ebene \u2013 die h\u00f6chste Zustimmungsrate von B\u00fcrgerinnen und B\u00fcrgern in Europa zu einem europ\u00e4ischen Thema ist \u00fcbrigens die gemeinsame Bek\u00e4mpfung von Kriminalit\u00e4t, mehr innere Sicherheit\u00a0\u2013, und dann k\u00fcrzt der Rat die Ans\u00e4tze um 7,8 Milliarden Euro \u2013 \u00fcbrigens drei Tage, bevor er das zus\u00e4tzliche Programm f\u00fcr Europol, das sich ja in der Zeitung sch\u00f6n liest, beschlossen hat.\nIhre strategischen Ziele sind die richtigen. Aber die Kommission muss sich mit jenen Staats- und Regierungschefs, mit jenen Ministern und Ministerr\u00e4ten in Konflikt begeben, die nicht bereit sind, montags den Preis f\u00fcr die Reden zu bezahlen, die sie sonntags gehalten haben. Das erwarte ich von der Kommission. Sie k\u00f6nnen von uns erwarten, dass wir Ihre strategischen Ziele unterst\u00fctzen \u2013 Sie haben die richtigen strategischen Ziele benannt\u00a0\u2013, aber wir erwarten von Ihnen, dass Sie in dem Kampf, den wir als Parlament mit den Staats- und Regierungschefs um ein St\u00fcckchen mehr Glaubw\u00fcrdigkeit der Europapolitik f\u00fchren, auf unserer Seite stehen.\nWenn wir das f\u00fcr 2007 gemeinsam vereinbaren, dann wird das ein spannendes und f\u00fcr die europ\u00e4ischen Institutionen sicherlich erfolgreiches Jahr.\n(Beifall)", "agenda_item": "2007 Annual Policy Strategy (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060322-ITEM-011", "intervention_id": "3-063", "summary_english": "```json\n{\n  \"headline\": \"Schulz Supports Commission's Strategic Objectives but Demands Fight for Adequate Funding Against Council Cuts\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"The key issue raised is the mismatch between ambitious European strategic objectives and inadequate financial resources.

Let me read through the debate summary again to make sure I get the right points.\n\nThe user mentioned that the debate was about the European Commission's 2007 Annual Policy Strategy. The summary has several sections. Under the \"Budget and Financial Framework Tensions\" section, there's a quote from Martin Schulz. The key part here is that he criticized the Council for cutting the Commission's budget request from 1.022 trillion to 840 billion euros. He said, \"politicians are not willing to pay on Monday for the speeches they gave on Sunday.\" \n\nSo, the issue here is the budget cuts versus the Commission's requests. Schulz's position is that the Council isn't following through with the necessary funding for the policies they talk about. The argument is that there's a hypocrisy in not funding the initiatives they support. The proposal would be that the Council should provide the necessary budgetary support. \n\nI need to make sure that I don't include other speakers' points. The user specified that only the points attributed to Martin Schulz should be included. The other parts of the summary mention other speakers like Fran\u00e7oise Grosset\u00eate, but those aren't relevant here. \n\nSo, structuring the JSON: \n\nissueSum should mention the budgetary issues and the discrepancy between speeches and actions. \n\npositionSum would be his criticism of the Council's budget cuts and the hypocrisy. \n\nargSum would be the reasoning behind his position, which is the lack of funding for the policies they advocate. \n\npropSum would be his call for the Council to provide the necessary funding. \n\nI need to make sure the summaries are concise and only include what's attributed to Schulz.

The user provided a debate summary from 2007 about the European Commission's Annual Policy Strategy, and they want me to focus on Graham Watson's contributions.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the debate summary and find any mentions of Graham Watson. Scanning through the sections, I see a part under \"Member State Accountability\" where Graham Watson is mentioned. The summary states: \"Graham Watson and Martin Schulz particularly criticized member states for approving ambitious goals while refusing adequate resources. Watson argued that 'who will trust leadership which says one thing and does another; which agrees policies, but then backtracks, disrupts and weakens their implementation' [Watson, 2007].\"\n\nSo, the key points here are Watson's criticism of member states for not providing enough resources despite agreeing to goals. His argument is about the lack of trust in leadership that doesn't follow through. The issue is the gap between policy agreements and actual implementation due to insufficient resources. His position is that member states are not following through, and his argument is based on the need for consistency and commitment. There's no mention of specific proposals from Watson, just his criticism and the reasoning behind it.\n\nNow, structuring this into the required JSON format. The \"issueSum\" should mention the criticism of member states for not funding adequately. \"positionSum\" would state his stance on the inconsistency. \"argSum\" is the reasoning about trust and implementation. \"propSum\" might be empty since he didn't propose a specific policy, just pointed out the problem.\n\nI need to make sure not to include other speakers' points.

We therefore call on you to make an agreement and to work for an agreement, but subject to our conditions, which ought also to be yours. I fully agree with the agreement on the financial perspectives, but not subject to the Council\u2019s conditions. Until we can count on agreement and a clear alliance with the Commission on this point, debates like today\u2019s will remain somewhat devoid of substance.\nSecondly, you mentioned other topics and I would like to refer to two in particular: one is the issue of immigration and internal security. You said that the priorities will be Schengen, controls and borders, but you said nothing about one point although it is mentioned in the text: the problem is an aspect that we consider a priority, which is legal immigration procedures. This element is present in your texts, but it is absent from what is done and what is said! The fact that the Commission is not able to say one word \u2013 not even one \u2013 on the subject of the thousands who have died between Mauritania and the Canary Isles and on the fact that my country, Italy, still has an unknown agreement with Libya that has been hidden from you and from this Parliament, which has caused the death of a huge number of people in that desert, means that debate about a common immigration policy is still just empty words. We would be delighted to hear just one word from you on this subject that is not merely a general remark.\nThirdly, there is the issue of energy. We have a problem; you are aware that there are differences of opinion on this matter, and particularly that in our view nuclear energy and renewable energy cannot be placed on the same footing \u2013 they are two different things. We acknowledge the fact that there is nuclear energy on this continent, but we cannot believe that this is an energy of the future for our continent, partly because \u2013 and this is not a minor consideration \u2013 we still have to import uranium, whereas we do not have to import sun or wind! This is an important point, at least from a conceptual point of view, and nuclear power should not be placed on the same footing! We have to understand, very clearly and very specifically, that we cannot depend on nuclear power. Nuclear power today meets only a part of our requirements and it is certainly not an option for the future.\nIn addition, on energy issues, there is still a gaping hole in the Commission\u2019s strategy: its silence on the transport question. Seventy per cent of our dependence on oil relates to transport. Even in this Parliament we have not been able to help very much, I agree, with regard to an innovative transport policy, but I believe that the Commission ought to help us on this matter.\nI would like to end, Mr\u00a0President, by saying that there is another priority which is being ignored in this area, and that is our cities. Cities are an opportunity not only as a kind of laboratory but also for Europe\u2019s use, and currently insufficient use is being made of them both from the viewpoint of financial support and from the viewpoint of major strategies. Perhaps it is better to start with cities rather than with major infrastructure, which in any case will not be financed by Europe either.", "lang": "IT", "original": "Monica Frassoni, a nome del gruppo Verts/ALE . \u2013 Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, siamo ora discutendo di un\u2019altra strategia, di un altro libro e di un altro set di priorit\u00e0; allo stesso modo in cui noi abbiamo discusso degli altri, vorremmo mettere l\u2019accento su due o tre questioni, in primo luogo sull\u2019accordo concernente le prospettive finanziarie.\nPresidente, lei sa benissimo che a trovare un accordo oggi in questo momento con il Consiglio vuol dire ridurre in modo assoluto le nostre ambizioni e quelle ovviamente dei cittadini. La invitiamo pertanto a fare un accordo e a lavorare per un accordo, per\u00f2 alle nostre condizioni, che dovrebbero essere anche le sue. Condivido al massimo l\u2019accordo sulle prospettive finanziarie, ma non alle condizioni del Consiglio. Fino a quando non potremo contare su un accordo e su un\u2019alleanza chiara con la Commissione su questo, anche discussioni come quelle di oggi resteranno un po\u2019 velleitarie.\nIn secondo luogo, lei ha citato alcuni temi e vorrei riferirmi in particolare a due: uno \u00e8 la questione dell\u2019immigrazione e della sicurezza interna. Lei ha detto che le priorit\u00e0 saranno Schengen, repressione, frontiere, e anche se nel testo le si cita, al riguardo non ha detto nulla: il problema riguarda un aspetto per noi prioritario, ossia le vie legali dell\u2019immigrazione. Nei suoi testi quest\u2019elemento c\u2019\u00e8, ma \u00e8 assente nell\u2019azione e nel linguaggio! Il fatto che la Commissione non sia capace di dire una parola, dico una, sul tema dei mille morti fra la Mauritania e le Canarie e sulla questione che il mio paese, l\u2019Italia, ha ancora un accordo sconosciuto con la Libia, nascosto a lei e a questo Parlamento, che ha provocato la morte di un sacco di gente in quel deserto, fa s\u00ec che parlare di una politica d\u2019immigrazione comune sia ancora qualcosa di velleitario. Ci farebbe piacere su questo tema sentire da lei una parola che non sia solo generica.\nIn terzo luogo la questione dell\u2019energia. Abbiamo un problema, lei sa che esistono differenze di opinioni in materia e in particolare che a nostro parere non si pu\u00f2 mettere sullo stesso piano l\u2019energia nucleare e l\u2019energia rinnovabile, sono due cose diverse. Prendiamo atto del fatto che in questo continente c\u2019\u00e8 l\u2019energia nucleare, ma non possiamo pensare che questa sia un\u2019energia di futuro per il nostro continente, anche perch\u00e9, e questo non \u00e8 un elemento secondario, comunque l\u2019uranio lo dobbiamo importare, il sole e il vento no! Gi\u00e0 questo \u00e8 un aspetto importante, almeno da un punto di vista concettuale, e non bisogna metterlo sullo stesso piano! Dobbiamo considerare in modo molto chiaro e molto concreto che non possiamo dipendere dal nucleare, il nucleare risponde oggi soltanto ad una parte delle nostre esigenze e sicuramente non \u00e8 un\u2019opzione per il futuro.\nInoltre, sulle questioni dell\u2019energia, esiste sempre un buco totale nella strategia della Commissione ed \u00e8 il silenzio sulla questione dei trasporti: il 70 per cento della nostra dipendenza sul petrolio riguarda i trasporti e anche in questo Parlamento non siamo riusciti ad aiutarla molto, sono d\u2019accordo, per quanto riguarda una prospettiva innovativa sui trasporti, ma credo che la Commissione su questo ci dovrebbe aiutare.\nFinisco, signor Presidente, dicendo che c\u2019\u00e8 un\u2019altra priorit\u00e0 trascurata in materia, precisamente quella delle citt\u00e0. Le citt\u00e0 sono un momento non soltanto di laboratorio ma anche di utilizzo dell\u2019Europa, oggi insufficiente sia dal punto di vista del sostegno finanziario che dal punto di vista delle grandi strategie.

The user provided a debate summary from 2007 about the European Commission's Annual Policy Strategy, and they want the main points from Monica Frassoni's speech.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the debate summary and find any mentions of Monica Frassoni. Scanning through the sections, there's a part under \"Energy Policy and Nuclear Debate\" where she's mentioned. She argued that nuclear energy and renewable energy can't be on the same level because uranium is imported, unlike sun and wind.\n\nSo, the key issue here is the role of nuclear power versus renewables. Her position is that they shouldn't be treated equally. The argument is based on the fact that uranium needs to be imported, making nuclear less sustainable compared to renewables. There's no mention of proposals or policy actions from her, just her argument against equating the two. \n\nI need to structure this into the JSON format as specified. The issue summary should mention the energy policy debate, her position is against equating nuclear and renewables, the argument is about uranium imports, and there's no proposal mentioned. So the propSum would be empty. Let me make sure not to include other speakers' points. Yep, that's all from her. So the JSON should reflect that.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The role of nuclear energy versus renewable energy in the EU's energy policy.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"Monica Frassoni argued that nuclear energy and renewable energy should not be considered equivalent.\",\n\"argSum\": \"She stated that uranium, required for nuclear energy, must be imported, whereas renewable energy sources like sun and wind are indigenous and do not require imports.\",\n\"propSum\": \"\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Kyriacos Triantaphyllides,", "english": "Kyriacos Triantaphyllides, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group . \u2013 (EL) Mr President, the major question raised by my political group lies not solely in the policies for which specific provision is made for 2007, but also in the doubts which are being created in our mind in connection with the broader strategic direction being given to the European construct as a whole.\nIt is unacceptable for us to become witnesses every day to the tempestuous concern and protests which have been stirred up by the new anti-grass roots employment laws in France; we have frequently become witnesses recently of citizens' reactions to various directives. It is unacceptable when the Union buries its head in the sand by following through on policies which promote benefits not for the workers but for large companies.\nIt is following through on the Lisbon Strategy which, in a bid to disorientate the workers, is now allegedly a 'reformed' strategy. Has it perhaps been reformed or changed in substance since when it was first decided or has it managed to promote the development of a social policy agenda designed to safeguard basic social standards, quality employment and the reconciliation of work and private life? No, it has not.\nIn the name of competitiveness, workers rights are on the receiving end every day of the fire of capitalist Europe. Working times are being extended, wages are being cut, collective agreements are being abolished, unemployment and unequal pay are increasing and the welfare regime is being swept away completely. The first to suffer are young people, the people on whom we are calling \u2013 and that is the irony \u2013 to build a Europe with a future.\nAt the same time, policies are being promoted which allegedly oil the wheels of immigration. How can that be, when their objective is once again the criteria laid down to safeguard the economic interests of Europe, when immigrants and people who need international protection are being kept on European territory under conditions of detention when their only crime has been to seek a humane life?\nEuropean resources should be used not to finance policies to strengthen closed borders, deportations and repatriations, but to remedy the real causes of immigration and to promote human rights in a substantial manner within the framework of a mutually beneficial neighbourhood policy, far from the philosophy of the reforms of the World Trade Organisation and the World Bank and from the philosophy of military intervention.", "lang": "EL", "original":

Scanning through the sections, there's a part under \"Labor Markets and Social Policy\" where he's quoted. The summary says he condemned policies serving \"big corporations rather than workers,\" arguing that \"in the name of competitiveness, labor achievements face daily attacks from a capitalist Europe.\"\n\nSo, the issue here is labor market policies favoring corporations over workers. His position is critical of these policies. The argument is that competitiveness is being used to undermine labor achievements. There's no mention of specific proposals from him, just his criticism and the reasoning. \n\nI need to structure this into the JSON format as specified. The \"issueSum\" should capture the main issue he raised. \"positionSum\" is his stance, \"argSum\" the reasoning, and \"propSum\" any proposals. Since he didn't suggest specific policies, the propSum might be empty. Let me check the original debate summary again to ensure I didn't miss any proposals. No, the summary only includes his criticism and argument. So propSum would be an empty string. \n\nPutting it all together, making sure each field is a summary without including other speakers' points.

Action by the Commission ought to cover all spheres, and at the same time it should choose as its priorities those initiatives that are important not only in one specific sector but also for the overall development of the European Union.\nIn the Commission\u2019s programme, the launching of the space programme and the regular evaluation of strategy were among the most important measures mentioned for the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy in 2007. While not contesting the importance of these measures, I believe that specific measures to foster the development of small and medium-sized enterprises and the development of the services sector would offer broader support to the Lisbon process, but such measures were not included in the list. Although the development of small and medium-sized enterprises appears among the priorities listed, this priority is not reflected at all in the list of principal actions. It is the development of this sector, however, that can actually make the most rapid contribution to achieving the goals of employment and growth. Although the development of the services sector is and remains one of the main instruments for implementing the Lisbon Strategy in the Commission\u2019s strategy for 2007, no specific measures for the development of the services sector are mentioned. We hope that it was not as a result of a deliberate move, but of a failure to coordinate the strategy established with operational measures, that the reform of the services sector was not included in the Commission\u2019s policy strategy for 2006.\nThe adoption of the Services Directive in 2007 will also clear the way for new initiatives by the European Commission in sectors that have been identified for liberalisation of services. The creation of one-stop agencies would be one specific move in this direction.\n2007 will be decisive for debates about the future of the European Union. One of the main criteria according to which the European public will judge the European Union\u2019s viability and future prospects in 2007 will be the concrete results of action taken by the European Union\u2019s institutions, including the Commission. This specificity ought, however, to be already apparent in the setting out of priorities and tasks, by defining the measures planned for 2007 not only in terms of continuing work already begun but also in terms of achieving concrete results.", "lang": "LV", "original": "Guntars Krasts, UEN grupas v\u0101rd\u0101 . \u2013 Lai mazin\u0101tu plaisu starp Eiropas Savien\u012bbas Lisabonas m\u0113r\u0137iem un realit\u0101ti, Komisijas darba pl\u0101niem 2007. gadam j\u0101b\u016bt ambicioziem.

The user provided a debate summary from 2007 about the European Commission's Annual Policy Strategy and wants me to focus on Guntars Krasts's contributions. But wait, the debate summary they gave doesn't mention Guntars Krasts at all. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the executive summary and the various points discussed\u2014topics like budget cuts, constitutional issues, energy policy, labor markets, etc.\u2014there's no reference to a speaker named Guntars Krasts. The names mentioned are Barroso, Schulz, Grosset\u00eate, Duff, Sz\u00e1jer, Frassoni, Swoboda, Triantaphyllides, Masiel, Harbour, Watson, Stubb, Bowis, Rou\u010dek, Titford, Karatzaferis. No Krasts there.\n\nSo, the user is asking about a speaker who wasn't mentioned in the provided debate summary. The instructions say that if there are no points attributed to the speaker, I should return an empty string. But the example response shows a JSON structure. Wait, the user's instruction says to respond in JSON, but if there's no information, return an empty string. However, the example given has filled fields. Hmm, maybe the user wants the JSON structure even if all fields are empty?\n\nWait, the user's exact instruction: \"If this is the case, respond with an empty string.\" But the example shows a filled JSON. Maybe there's a misunderstanding. Let me recheck the user's message.\n\nThe user says: \"There may be no points or arguments attributed to the speaker. If this is the case, respond with an empty string.\"\n\nBut the example response is a JSON. So perhaps the user expects that if there's no data, the response is an empty string, not a JSON. But the initial instruction says to structure the response as JSON. This is conflicting.\n\nWait, the user says: \"You must respond in json format. Outputs must be parseable by json.loads().\"\n\nBut if there are no points, the correct response would be an empty JSON object? Or an empty string? The user says \"respond with an empty string.\" So maybe the answer should be an empty string, not a JSON. But the example shows a JSON. This is confusing.\n\nBut given the user's instruction, if there's no data, return an empty string. So in this case, since Guntars Krasts isn't mentioned in the debate summary, the answer should be an empty string. However, the user's example shows a JSON. But perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. To comply with the instruction, I should return an empty string.\n\nBut the user also says: \"You will structure your response as json with the following structure...\" So maybe even if there's no data, the JSON should be empty. But the user says \"respond with an empty string.\" So perhaps the correct answer is an empty string, not a JSON. But the user's example shows a JSON. This is conflicting.\n\nIn any case, based on the user's explicit instruction: \"If this is the case, respond with an empty string.\" So the answer here is an empty string. But the user also says to respond in JSON. So maybe the empty string is the correct answer here. So the final answer is an empty string.\n</think>\n\n\"\"", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Jens-Peter Bonde,", "english": "Jens-Peter Bonde, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. \u2013 (DA) Mr\u00a0President, the Commission has broken a clear pledge to present a full annual programme, setting out all proposed legislation and its legal bases.

The European Union has not yet managed to become unified following its most recent enlargement to include 10 new Member States, and yet it is already preparing for the future accession of Turkey.\nThe year 2007 could be a year of opportunity in terms of achieving a more unified Europe that demonstrates more solidarity if the old Member States open up towards the new Member States, particularly as regards liberalising their labour markets. Unfortunately there appear to be few countries with the courage of Spain and Portugal, which know from their own recent experience how difficult it is to be a second-class citizen in the European Union. I propose that any future enlargement of the European Union should either be full, or that it should not happen at all. I hope that in saying this I am also reflecting the will of the people of the Netherlands and France. It is not yet too late to deepen European unity by ensuring that it has a budget that lives up to its ambitions.\n2006 has drawn the attention of Europeans to the problem of energy supplies. Today more than ever, Europe needs a common energy policy. This would provide a good opportunity to improve the prospects of farmers, particularly in the new Member States, who could become involved in biofuel production.\nThe worldwide process of globalisation is inevitable.

The user provided a debate summary from 2007 about the European Commission's Annual Policy Strategy, and they want me to focus on Jan Tadeusz Masiel's contributions. The task is to extract his main points, positions, arguments, and proposals from the debate.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the debate summary and find any mentions of Jan Tadeusz Masiel. The summary mentions him in the section about labor markets and social policy. The exact quote is: \"Jan Tadeusz Masiel called for old member states to open labor markets to new members, opposing the creation of 'second-class European citizenship'.\" \n\nSo, the key points here are about labor market openness and opposing second-class citizenship. The issue here is the integration of new member states into the labor markets of older ones. His position is that old members should open their labor markets. The argument is likely about fairness and preventing discrimination against new members. The proposal is to open labor markets.\n\nI need to make sure there are no other mentions of Masiel in the summary. Scanning through the other sections, I don't see any other references. The rest of the debate talks about other speakers' points, but not Masiel. \n\nSo, the response should include:\n- issueSum: Labor market integration of new members vs. old members.\n- positionSum: Advocating for opening labor markets to new members to avoid second-class citizenship.\n- argSum: The argument is about preventing discrimination and ensuring equal citizenship.\n- propSum: Proposing to open labor markets.\n\nI need to structure this into JSON without any extra information.

I welcome them both in respect of the procedural issues and their content.\nIn respect of procedural issues, I am pleased about the initiative that had already started last year as a result of the agreement reached between the European Parliament and the European Commission, ensuring that the European Parliament, including its committees, will have a greater involvement and opportunity to participate in the drafting of the annual policy strategy and legislation programme. I hope that the difficulties experienced last year will be eliminated this year.\nThe content of the document submitted by the Commission, too, has undergone a significant change compared to previous years, and it points in the right direction. Paradoxically, we could also say that the fact that the document does not contain budgetary specifications due to the absence of financial perspectives has had a positive effect on it, as it enabled a better concentration on the political goals and tasks facing the European Union.\nAt the same time, we should not forget the context in which this plan has been created, either. Over the past years, we have felt on several occasions that Europe is not moving forward, but backwards, and it does not take necessary steps. In the course of last year, we managed to take a few tentative first steps in the right direction, but we have a huge number of unfinished projects. Let us have a look at them, one by one.\nOne such project is the Constitution, which I think we need to complete as soon as possible. If we want to avoid a European Parliament full of Euro-sceptic groups, we should make sure that the Constitution is routed in the right direction before the start of the European Parliament elections.\nWe do not have a financial perspective, either. Therefore, the goals that are correctly formulated in this seven-year budget are not in place and do not have a firm foundation at the present time. We have made a correct step in the right direction in this respect, too, but we, here in Parliament, are not currently satisfied with the budget.\nWhen we talk about 2007, we also talk about enlargement, because Romania and Bulgaria will most likely become Member States of the European Union by then. While we feel that the tensions that had arisen in the European Union in relation with the last enlargement, due to a decrease in solidarity, are still unresolved, let us step into year 2007 in such a way that we work on the tensions that had come into existence in the course of the last enlargement.", "lang": "HU", "original": "J\u00f3zsef Sz\u00e1jer (PPE-DE). \u2013 Tisztelt Eln\u00f6k \u00dar!

Education is not something of interest only to an elite. Education must reach broad sections of the population if we want to achieve one of Europe\u2019s essential objectives, namely to prevent the exclusion of people or groups. Education is especially important, too, when we consider that we are de facto a continent of immigration. It is most important for the integration of new immigrant citizens that we develop the education sector accordingly.\nSo far as the Globalisation Fund you mention is concerned, we will in fact only be able to finance it if we also increase our competitiveness so that we do not risk having to call on this Globalisation Fund too often.\nA second example I would like to take, because you place a great deal of emphasis on it in your paper, is energy policy. I do not want to anticipate what the Members who will speak after me will have to say, but one important subject that you touched on is security of energy supply. I am very pleased that you visited Moscow recently and \u2013 from what I have heard \u2013 not without success, even though it is in many respects still up to Russia to take decisions, on the Energy Charter in particular.\nFinally, I have also heard that you have said we should also talk about nuclear energy. You are right and I am very pleased that we shall be hearing from the Commissioner responsible for energy shortly. Although I am sceptical about nuclear energy, we must still talk about it, and also about the risks it entails. If we are discussing proliferation these days in connection with Iran, then more nuclear energy also means more dangers unless we ensure, jointly and multilaterally, that the associated risks are minimised as much as possible.\nI think more ought to be said about this subject in particular, both by you and in the Green Paper. That is particularly the case, too, for infrastructure development. Because without more infrastructure \u2013 pipelines in particular, but in other areas as well \u2013 we will never be able to give this continent energy security and we will not give Europe the corresponding new technological boost. I fully support you on that. I wish you more strength and courage, however, in putting these decisions into effect.\nYou mentioned Montesquieu, and someone else wanted Machiavelli. I wish you the wisdom of a Montesquieu, but also the strength and cunning of a Machiavelli, to get your programme through.", "lang": "DE", "original": "Hannes Swoboda (PSE). \u2013 Herr Pr\u00e4sident, Herr Pr\u00e4sident Barroso! Ich w\u00fcrde Sie ersuchen, dass Sie noch intensiver, als es in dem von Ihnen vorgelegten Papier bereits der Fall ist, dar\u00fcber nachdenken, wie Sie die Inhalte und die Ziele, die Sie richtigerweise definieren, auch den B\u00fcrgerinnen und B\u00fcrgern st\u00e4rker vermitteln k\u00f6nnen.\nHerr Pr\u00e4sident Barroso, Wettbewerbsf\u00e4higkeit ist eines Ihrer wichtigen Themen, es ist eines unserer wichtigen Themen! Trotzdem sehe ich viele B\u00fcrgerinnen und B\u00fcrger, die glauben, das sei ein Thema, das sie nichts angeht, das nur die Wirtschaft, nur die gro\u00dfen Unternehmen etwas angeht. Nein, ohne Verst\u00e4rkung der Wettbewerbsf\u00e4higkeit k\u00f6nnen wir das soziale System in Europa nicht aufrechterhalten, ohne verst\u00e4rkte Wettbewerbsf\u00e4higkeit k\u00f6nnen wir das soziale Modell Europa nicht aufrechterhalten.\n\u00c4hnlich verh\u00e4lt es sich mit der Bildung. Bildung ist eben nicht etwas, was nur f\u00fcr eine Elite interessant ist. Bildung muss in die breiten Schichten gehen, wenn wir eines der wesentlichen Ziele Europas erreichen wollen, n\u00e4mlich den Ausschluss von Menschen oder Gruppen zu verhindern. Bildung ist gerade auch wichtig, wenn wir bedenken, dass wir de facto ein Zuwanderungskontinent sind. F\u00fcr die Integration der neu zugewanderten B\u00fcrgerinnen und B\u00fcrger ist es ganz wichtig, dass wir den Bildungssektor entsprechend ausbauen.\nWas den von Ihnen angesprochenen Globalisierungsfonds betrifft, so ist auch der in der Tat nur finanzierbar, wenn wir auf der anderen Seite auch durch die verst\u00e4rkte Wettbewerbsf\u00e4higkeit es nicht allzu oft darauf ankommen lassen, dass wir diesen Globalisierungsfonds in Anspruch nehmen m\u00fcssen.\nEin zweites Beispiel, das ich nehmen m\u00f6chte, weil Sie es in Ihrem Papier sehr stark betonen, ist die Energiepolitik. Ich m\u00f6chte den nach mir sprechenden Kollegen nicht vorgreifen, aber ein wichtiges Thema, das Sie angeschnitten haben, ist die Sicherheit der Energieversorgung. Ich bin sehr froh, dass Sie k\u00fcrzlich in Moskau waren und \u2013 soweit ich geh\u00f6rt habe \u2013 durchaus einige Erfolge mitgebracht haben, wenngleich es vielleicht in mancher Hinsicht noch an Russland liegt, Entscheidungen zu treffen, gerade was die Energiecharta betrifft.\nIch habe zuletzt auch geh\u00f6rt, dass Sie gemeint haben, wir m\u00fcssten auch \u00fcber Atomenergie sprechen. Sie haben Recht, und ich bin sehr froh, dass das f\u00fcr Energie zust\u00e4ndige Kommissionsmitglied jetzt kommt. Obwohl ich gegen\u00fcber der Atomenergie skeptisch bin, muss man doch dar\u00fcber reden, auch \u00fcber die damit verbundenen Risiken. Wenn wir gerade in diesen Tagen auch im Zusammenhang mit dem Iran die Frage der Weiterverbreitung diskutieren, dann bedeutet mehr Atomenergie auch mehr Gefahren, wenn wir nicht gemeinsam multilateral daf\u00fcr Sorge tragen, dass die damit verbundenen Risiken m\u00f6glichst minimiert werden.\nIch meine, dass man gerade zu diesem Thema mehr sagen m\u00fcsste, sowohl von Ihrer Seite als auch im Rahmen des Gr\u00fcnbuchs. Das trifft insbesondere auch f\u00fcr den Ausbau der Infrastruktur zu. Denn ohne vermehrte Infrastruktur \u2013 gerade auch was Pipelineverbindungen betrifft, aber auch in anderen Bereichen \u2013 werden wir diesem Kontinent weder die Energiesicherheit geben k\u00f6nnen noch Europa den entsprechenden neuen Technologieschub verschaffen. In diesem Sinne: volle Unterst\u00fctzung. Aber ich w\u00fcnsche Ihnen noch mehr Kraft und Mut, diese Entscheidungen umzusetzen.\nSie haben Montesquieu erw\u00e4hnt, jemand anders hat sich Machiavelli gew\u00fcnscht.

The user provided a debate summary from 2007 about the European Commission's Annual Policy Strategy, and they want me to focus on Hannes Swoboda's contributions. The task is to extract his main points, positions, arguments, and proposals from the debate.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the debate summary and find any mentions of Hannes Swoboda. Looking at the sections, under the \"Energy Policy and Nuclear Debate\" part, there's a mention of him. The summary says: \"Hannes Swoboda took a more pragmatic approach, acknowledging the need to discuss nuclear risks while supporting energy security initiatives.\"\n\nSo, the key points here are that Swoboda is pragmatic about nuclear energy. He acknowledges the need to discuss nuclear risks but supports energy security. That's his position. The argument here would be that he's balancing the risks with the need for energy security. There's no specific proposal mentioned, just his stance on nuclear energy. \n\nI need to make sure I don't include other speakers' points. For example, Monica Frassoni is mentioned as opposing nuclear energy, but that's not Swoboda. The user wants only Swoboda's contributions. \n\nSo, the issue here is energy policy, specifically nuclear energy's role. His position is pragmatic, supporting energy security while acknowledging nuclear risks. The argument is about balancing risks and security. There's no explicit proposal mentioned, just his stance. \n\nTherefore, the JSON should reflect that. The issueSum would be about nuclear energy's role in energy policy. PositionSum is his pragmatic approach. ArgSum is the balance between risks and security. PropSum might be empty or mention supporting energy security initiatives. Wait, the summary says he \"supports energy security initiatives,\" so that's a proposal. \n\nSo, propSum would be supporting energy security initiatives while discussing nuclear risks. Need to check the exact wording. The original says he \"acknowledging the need to discuss nuclear risks while supporting energy security initiatives.\" So his proposal is to support energy security initiatives, which includes considering nuclear risks. \n\nSo putting it all together, the JSON should have those elements. Make sure not to include other speakers' points. The user said to only include points attributed to the speaker, which in this case is Swoboda. No other contributions are mentioned for him.

The user provided a debate summary from 2007 about the European Commission's Annual Policy Strategy, and they want me to focus on Georgios Karatzaferis (IND/DEM). The task is to extract his main points, positions, arguments, and proposals from the debate, but only what's attributed to him.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the debate summary and find any mentions of Georgios Karatzaferis. The summary mentions him in the \"Fundamental Disagreements\" section. The exact quote is: \"Georgios Karatzaferis argued that 'if the Maastricht Treaty is not revised, Europe will evolve into a poor neighborhood' [Karatzaferis, 2007].\"\n\nSo, the key issue here is the Maastricht Treaty and its revision. His position is that without revising the Maastricht Treaty, Europe faces a decline into a \"poor neighborhood.\" The argument is that the current treaty isn't sufficient, and revision is necessary to prevent this outcome. However, the summary doesn't mention any specific proposals he made beyond this statement. \n\nThe user's example response includes four fields: issueSum, positionSum, argSum, propSum. Let's map the information accordingly. \n\nIssueSum: The main issue he raised is the need for revising the Maastricht Treaty to prevent Europe from becoming a \"poor neighborhood.\"\n\nPositionSum: His position is that the Maastricht Treaty must be revised; otherwise, Europe will face negative consequences.\n\nArgSum: The argument is that without revision, the current structure of the treaty is insufficient, leading to a decline.\n\nPropSum: The summary doesn't mention any specific proposals beyond the call for revision. So this might be an empty string.\n\nWait, but the user's example has propSum as a summary of proposals. Since the debate summary only mentions his argument about the Maastricht Treaty, but no specific policy actions or proposals, propSum would be empty. \n\nI need to make sure that I don't include anything not attributed to him. The other parts of the debate, like energy policy or budget issues, are from other speakers, so they shouldn't be included. \n\nSo the final JSON should have:\n\nissueSum: \"The key issue raised by the speaker relates to the necessity of revising the Maastricht Treaty to prevent Europe from becoming a 'poor neighborhood.'\"\npositionSum: \"He argues that without revising the Maastricht Treaty, Europe will face a decline into a 'poor neighborhood.'\"\nargSum: \"His argument is based on the belief that the current Maastricht Treaty is insufficient to ensure Europe's prosperity and that revision is necessary to avoid negative outcomes.\"\npropSum: \"\" (since there's no mention of specific proposals, only the argument for revision)\n\nI need to check if the user's example has propSum as an empty string when there are no proposals.

It can now be said that the 2004 enlargement has been a great success for Europe, from a political, security, economic and social point of view, and I am sure that 2007 will see that success continue. In 2007, the first new Member States are set to enter the euro zone. In this regard, I should like to challenge the Commission to be proactive in helping those countries to prepare for the arrival of the euro, and strictly to monitor compliance with entry requirements, the so-called Maastricht criteria. I am convinced that meeting the criteria, whether of Maastricht or of the Stability and Growth Pact, is crucial to preserving the political, financial and community credibility of the single European currency.\nIn 2007, the new Member States of Central and Eastern Europe will also become part of the enlarged Schengen area. The scrapping of internal border controls between Member States, enabling genuine freedom of movement within the Union should under no circumstances mean enabling freedom of movement for all manner of criminality, illegal migration, and so forth. The fight against crime and violence in Europe, along with the launch of the second generation of the Schengen system should, to my mind, form part of the EU's clear and practical priorities for 2007.\nLastly, 2007 should also be the year of the next enlargement, with the accession to the Union of Romania and Bulgaria. In this regard, I should like to call on the Commission to help these two countries to prepare for accession and to ensure that they fulfil their entry requirements in every respect. Romania and Bulgaria must be as properly prepared for accession as were the 10 accession countries in 2004.

(PT) Unfortunately, I have to leave shortly, as I have an official engagement with the Belgian authorities. I did not expect the sitting to carry on as late as it has, following the first part of proceedings in the Chamber before the beginning of this item on the agenda. Come what may, the Commission will be present until the end of the debate. I will still be able to answer some of the questions.\nI should first like to express my gratitude for the comments, which were for the most part in favour of our programme. There is obviously the underlying question of the financial perspective, which I shall discuss in a moment. In general, however, I feel I can say that the Commission's objectives for 2007 have been received positively.\nMore specifically, Mr Watson asked why we put objectives relating to energy conservation and environmental protection under the heading of solidarity and not that of prosperity. Of course, they could and should come under the heading of prosperity, but we put them under solidarity in order to highlight their enormous importance, given that the term \u2018solidarity\u2019 refers to solidarity with future generations. The struggle for a clean environment and for sustainable development is of direct relevance to our future as a whole. This was what led us to put environmental issues under the heading of solidarity, in terms of presentation.\nAs regards immigration, Mrs Frassoni said that we have never given our opinion on the issue of illegal immigration and the tragedy of the many Africans who die in the Mediterranean. I am sorry, but this is not true. There have been a number of clear Commission positions on this issue, expressed by Mr Frattini, and the truth of the matter is that we are fighting to achieve a joint approach, where possible, among the Member States on these issues.\nMrs Frassoni also asked about the absence of any mention of transport in the context of energy policy. I am sorry, but the Green Paper says that we have proposed the following possible actions to the Member States, and I quote, from page 11 of the English text:\n\u2018a major effort to improve energy efficiency in the transport sector, and in particular to improve rapidly urban public transport in Europe\u2019s major cities\u2019\n(PT) Of course this is only a Green Paper, for consultation purposes, but that line is there. When it comes to energy efficiency, we feel that the transport sector is crucial. Let no one be in any doubt about this.\nOne of the honourable Members mentioned the opening up of labour markets in Europe. You know that the Commission is in favour of this. On the back of our report, a number of Member States \u2013 not only those mentioned, namely Portugal and Spain, but also Finland and the Dutch Government \u2013 have announced their intention to promote the liberalisation of the labour markets in Europe at the earliest opportunity. This is moreover the case in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Sweden. I gather that others are also considering facilitating the free movement of workers in the EU.\nMr Swoboda asked how this can be better explained to our citizens, or, in other words, what we can do to explain Europe\u2019s added value, which is a very important question. This is easier on some issues than others. Today, in fact, we announced a very important measure, the air safety \u2018blacklist\u2019, which is the first piece of legislation adopted by this Commission, with the support of Parliament and the Council. This is an issue on which the advantages of Community-level action are abundantly clear to the citizens. On issues such as these, we need to go the extra mile to provide explanations and argue our point of view. This is indeed the Commission\u2019s job, but I should like to add, if I may, that all of us are responsible for doing this: it is also the responsibility of Parliament, the honourable Members, national parliaments, of all those who have Europe\u2019s interests at heart and those who feel the necessity to explain the added value that Europe brings.\nOn the nuclear issue, Mr Swoboda, our position is very clear: we respect the subsidiarity principle. This is a tough question in Europe; there are Member States in favour and others against. The way forward, as far as I am concerned, is not to avoid debate. Mr Swoboda mentioned my meeting with President Putin. I wish to tell you that, despite Russia's wealth of natural oil and gas resources, President Putin has stated that one of Russia\u2019s main priorities in the future is to develop nuclear energy. This is therefore an issue that we cannot avoid; it is an issue that is on the agenda and that must be discussed frankly. The Commission is not taking sides in the nuclear energy debate. What we are promoting is the principle whereby each Member State finds forms of long-term, sustainable energy in its energy \u2018mix\u2019, whilst ensuring compliance with the subsidiarity principle.\nMr Duff and others raised the question of the Constitution. This is not what we are discussing here today, but I should like to confirm that the Commission remains devoted to the principles and the values enshrined in the draft Constitutional Treaty, and we are working on this issue. We are thinking of bringing some ideas on the future of the European debate to the June European Council. Hopefully these ideas will make a worthwhile contribution. Although the Constitutional Treaty, as the name suggests, is an intergovernmental Treaty, the Commission is committed to honouring its responsibilities and will thus want to make its own contribution to this period of reflection.\nI do not know if it will be a contribution to rival the explorations made by Vasco da Gama in terms of ambition, as suggested by Mr Martin, but in any case it will be our contribution. In any event, I was happy today to hear Montesquieu, Machiavelli and Vasco da Gama mentioned in our debate, which shows that the level of debate in Parliament is moving ever upward.\nAnd now I shall make some comments in English \u2013 I always speak in English when I speak about money! I got used to it during the British Presidency. So, now some remarks in English about the financial perspectives.\nMy understanding is that real progress was made yesterday between the institutions. On the basis of compromise texts presented by the Commission, a third trialogue took place yesterday afternoon with the Austrian Presidency, the negotiating team from Parliament and the Commission. Our understanding is that the outcome of the meeting was largely positive. On the interinstitutional agreement itself, there is almost full agreement, including on the idea of adding a new Part Three on sound financial management.\nSubject to final technical verifications, texts have been agreed on important points such as the Financial Regulation, certification by Member States and the review clause. When I say \u2018agreed\u2019, I mean agreed between the delegations. They are agreements ad referendum . All these points have been considered key elements in various resolutions adopted by Parliament. I am pleased to see that the three institutions have been able to reach consensus on them and I am proud of the contribution that the Commission made to that agreement.\nAs regards figures, Parliament and the Council have exchanged their views and evaluations based on the ceilings agreed at the December European Council. Let us be frank. There is still a big difference between the figures proposed by Parliament and those proposed by the Council. I want to be clear about this. The Commission supports the most ambitious possible agreement. The question, frankly, is: how far is the Council prepared to go? I therefore appeal for a compromise to be reached as soon as possible. If there is no compromise, it will be negative for all of us in the European Union, in particular for the new Member States and those Member States and regions that really need our solidarity for their development.\nThe solution could be to find the appropriate mix between three elements: flexibility, ways of mobilising the funds on the various flexibility mechanisms and, finally, the overall ceilings.\nThere is light at the end of the tunnel! A final trialogue is scheduled for 4 or 5\u00a0April 2006 in Strasbourg. It is my firm conviction that an agreement can be reached at that meeting. In the meantime, the Commission will continue to play its active role in seeking the most ambitious position, but, in the end, we need ambition with an agreement. Therefore, I approve of ambition but with realism and responsibility, trying to bring all the institutions on board.\nI know that the Austrian Presidency is actively seeking an agreement with all the Member States. Let me tell you that at the various meetings I have had with the Heads of Government \u2013 and this week I have had several \u2013 I urged them, both publicly and privately, to accept an increase in overall expenditure. I quoted, in particular, the need for education and culture: the Erasmus and citizenship programmes. There, at least, we should make a real effort and some progress is possible. Let us all work hard towards reaching a good agreement and then, if we have good intentions, a good strategy and good policies. Let us hope that we also have good instruments in terms of the financial perspectives.\n(Applause)", "lang": "EN", "original": "Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, President of the Commission . (PT) Unfortunately, I have to leave shortly, as I have an official engagement with the Belgian authorities. I did not expect the sitting to carry on as late as it has, following the first part of proceedings in the Chamber before the beginning of this item on the agenda. Come what may, the Commission will be present until the end of the debate. I will still be able to answer some of the questions.\nI should first like to express my gratitude for the comments, which were for the most part in favour of our programme. There is obviously the underlying question of the financial perspective, which I shall discuss in a moment. In general, however, I feel I can say that the Commission's objectives for 2007 have been received positively.\nMore specifically, Mr Watson asked why we put objectives relating to energy conservation and environmental protection under the heading of solidarity and not that of prosperity. Of course, they could and should come under the heading of prosperity, but we put them under solidarity in order to highlight their enormous importance, given that the term \u2018solidarity\u2019 refers to solidarity with future generations. The struggle for a clean environment and for sustainable development is of direct relevance to our future as a whole. This was what led us to put environmental issues under the heading of solidarity, in terms of presentation.\nAs regards immigration, Mrs Frassoni said that we have never given our opinion on the issue of illegal immigration and the tragedy of the many Africans who die in the Mediterranean. I am sorry, but this is not true. There have been a number of clear Commission positions on this issue, expressed by Mr Frattini, and the truth of the matter is that we are fighting to achieve a joint approach, where possible, among the Member States on these issues.\nMrs Frassoni also asked about the absence of any mention of transport in the context of energy policy. I am sorry, but the Green Paper says that we have proposed the following possible actions to the Member States, and I quote, from page 11 of the English text:\n\u2018a major effort to improve energy efficiency in the transport sector, and in particular to improve rapidly urban public transport in Europe\u2019s major cities\u2019\n(PT) Of course this is only a Green Paper, for consultation purposes, but that line is there. When it comes to energy efficiency, we feel that the transport sector is crucial. Let no one be in any doubt about this.\nOne of the honourable Members mentioned the opening up of labour markets in Europe. You know that the Commission is in favour of this. On the back of our report, a number of Member States \u2013 not only those mentioned, namely Portugal and Spain, but also Finland and the Dutch Government \u2013 have announced their intention to promote the liberalisation of the labour markets in Europe at the earliest opportunity. This is moreover the case in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Sweden. I gather that others are also considering facilitating the free movement of workers in the EU.\nMr Swoboda asked how this can be better explained to our citizens, or, in other words, what we can do to explain Europe\u2019s added value, which is a very important question. This is easier on some issues than others. Today, in fact, we announced a very important measure, the air safety \u2018blacklist\u2019, which is the first piece of legislation adopted by this Commission, with the support of Parliament and the Council. This is an issue on which the advantages of Community-level action are abundantly clear to the citizens. On issues such as these, we need to go the extra mile to provide explanations and argue our point of view. This is indeed the Commission\u2019s job, but I should like to add, if I may, that all of us are responsible for doing this: it is also the responsibility of Parliament, the honourable Members, national parliaments, of all those who have Europe\u2019s interests at heart and those who feel the necessity to explain the added value that Europe brings.\nOn the nuclear issue, Mr Swoboda, our position is very clear: we respect the subsidiarity principle. This is a tough question in Europe; there are Member States in favour and others against. The way forward, as far as I am concerned, is not to avoid debate. Mr Swoboda mentioned my meeting with President Putin. I wish to tell you that, despite Russia's wealth of natural oil and gas resources, President Putin has stated that one of Russia\u2019s main priorities in the future is to develop nuclear energy. This is therefore an issue that we cannot avoid; it is an issue that is on the agenda and that must be discussed frankly. The Commission is not taking sides in the nuclear energy debate. What we are promoting is the principle whereby each Member State finds forms of long-term, sustainable energy in its energy \u2018mix\u2019, whilst ensuring compliance with the subsidiarity principle.\nMr Duff and others raised the question of the Constitution. This is not what we are discussing here today, but I should like to confirm that the Commission remains devoted to the principles and the values enshrined in the draft Constitutional Treaty, and we are working on this issue. We are thinking of bringing some ideas on the future of the European debate to the June European Council. Hopefully these ideas will make a worthwhile contribution. Although the Constitutional Treaty, as the name suggests, is an intergovernmental Treaty, the Commission is committed to honouring its responsibilities and will thus want to make its own contribution to this period of reflection.\nI do not know if it will be a contribution to rival the explorations made by Vasco da Gama in terms of ambition, as suggested by Mr Martin, but in any case it will be our contribution. In any event, I was happy today to hear Montesquieu, Machiavelli and Vasco da Gama mentioned in our debate, which shows that the level of debate in Parliament is moving ever upward.\nAnd now I shall make some comments in English \u2013 I always speak in English when I speak about money! I got used to it during the British Presidency. So, now some remarks in English about the financial perspectives.\nMy understanding is that real progress was made yesterday between the institutions. On the basis of compromise texts presented by the Commission, a third trialogue took place yesterday afternoon with the Austrian Presidency, the negotiating team from Parliament and the Commission. Our understanding is that the outcome of the meeting was largely positive. On the interinstitutional agreement itself, there is almost full agreement, including on the idea of adding a new Part Three on sound financial management.\nSubject to final technical verifications, texts have been agreed on important points such as the Financial Regulation, certification by Member States and the review clause. When I say \u2018agreed\u2019, I mean agreed between the delegations. They are agreements ad referendum . All these points have been considered key elements in various resolutions adopted by Parliament. I am pleased to see that the three institutions have been able to reach consensus on them and I am proud of the contribution that the Commission made to that agreement.\nAs regards figures, Parliament and the Council have exchanged their views and evaluations based on the ceilings agreed at the December European Council.

Let me start by reading through the summary carefully.\n\nThe debate is about the European Commission's 2007 Annual Policy Strategy. The user provided a detailed summary with various speakers' contributions. The task is to extract the main points, positions, arguments, and proposals made by Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, the Commission President.\n\nLooking at the Executive Summary section, under \"Commission's Strategic Vision,\" it mentions that Barroso outlined ambitious priorities for 2007. His key points were \"sustainable growth to provide more and better jobs in Europe\" and the idea that Europe needs a \"red carpet, not red tape\" for businesses. He emphasized the year as crucial for prosperity, solidarity, and security through better regulation, completing financial perspectives, and preparing for the Treaty of Rome's 50th anniversary.\n\nNow, I need to structure this into the four categories: issueSum, positionSum, argSum, propSum.\n\nFor issueSum, the main issue Barroso addressed is the need for sustainable growth and job creation, along with the importance of regulatory improvements and financial planning.\n\nHis position (positionSum) would be supporting sustainable growth, better regulation, and the completion of financial perspectives. He also mentioned the importance of the Treaty of Rome's anniversary, which might relate to institutional aspects.\n\nThe arguments (argSum) would be that reducing red tape (bureaucracy) is essential for business, and that proper regulation and financial planning are necessary for achieving the strategic goals.\n\nFor proposals (propSum), he likely proposed initiatives around better regulation, completing financial perspectives, and preparing for the Treaty's anniversary. However, the summary doesn't mention specific policy actions beyond his strategic priorities. So maybe the proposals are the strategies he outlined, like focusing on growth, jobs, and regulatory improvements.\n\nI need to make sure not to include other speakers' points. The user specified that only Barroso's contributions should be included. The example response uses concise summaries, so I need to paraphrase the key points from the summary without adding extra information.\n\nDouble-checking the original text: Barroso's main points are sustainable growth, reducing red tape, better regulation, financial perspectives, and the Treaty of Rome's 50th anniversary. So the issues are growth, jobs, regulation, financial planning, and institutional preparation. His position is advocating for these priorities. The arguments are that reducing bureaucracy helps businesses, and proper regulation and finances are needed. Proposals would be the strategies mentioned, like completing financial perspectives and focusing on the treaty's anniversary.\n\nI need to present this in JSON format, ensuring that each field is a summary without markdown. Also, check for any possible mistakes, like including other speakers' points, but in this case, the summary clearly attributes the quotes to Barroso. So the answer should be based on that.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The key issues raised by the speaker include sustainable growth, job creation, regulatory reform, financial planning, and preparation for the Treaty of Rome's 50th anniversary.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"He emphasized the importance of sustainable growth and job creation through reduced regulatory burdens, better regulation, and completion of financial perspectives to achieve prosperity, solidarity, and security in Europe.\",\n\"argSum\": \"His arguments centered on the need for a business-friendly environment ('red carpet, not red tape') and the necessity of addressing regulatory and financial challenges to ensure the EU's strategic goals are met.\",\n\"propSum\": \"He proposed focusing on regulatory improvements, completing financial perspectives, and preparing for the Treaty of Rome's 50th anniversary as key steps to achieve the Commission's ambitions.\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Bronis\u0142aw Geremek (ALDE).", "english": "Bronis\u0142aw Geremek (ALDE). \u2013 (PL) Mr President, it is very important that Parliament should have the opportunity to hold a debate on strategy. 2007 will be a crucial year for the future of the European Union. In order for a strategic debate to take place in Parliament, choices need to be put to the House. The President of the Commission has not explained the choices open to the Commission, even though politics is the art of choice.\nIn first place is the constitutional question. Does the European Commission believe that the Constitution will be adopted in 2007, and does it have the opportunities and methods necessary to achieve this?\nIn second place is the important issue of employment. Is the answer to unemployment economic growth and reliance on economic freedom and the free movement of labour? If not, why not return to Colbert and economic protectionism, which was once called economic patriotism?\nIn third place, the issue of the Lisbon Strategy is a key problem for the future of the European Union. The matter has been reduced to rhetoric, as on the one hand we claim that the future of the European Union depends on the Lisbon Strategy, while on the other hand, when deciding on the budget and on budget cuts, the first cuts are made to scientific research and the education system.

Therefore, according to the instructions, if there are no points attributed to the speaker, the response should be an empty string. \n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I missed a mention.

The user provided a debate summary from 2007 about the European Commission's Annual Policy Strategy. The task is to extract the main points made by Jeffrey Titford, who is part of the IND/DEM group. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the debate summary and find any mentions of Jeffrey Titford. The summary mentions him in the \"Fundamental Disagreements\" section. It says, \"Jeffrey Titford's criticism of 'bureaucratic control'...\" \n\nSo, the key points here are his criticism of bureaucratic control. The user wants only the arguments attributed to him. The summary doesn't go into much detail beyond that mention. I need to check if there's more information elsewhere. \n\nLooking through the sections again: the executive summary, budget tensions, constitutional crisis, energy policy, labor markets, implementation challenges, member state accountability, communication, enlargement, and fundamental disagreements. The only direct mention is in the fundamental disagreements part. \n\nThe user's example response includes issueSum, positionSum, argSum, propSum. For Titford, the issue is bureaucratic control. His position is critical of it. The argument is probably that bureaucratic control is a problem, but the summary doesn't elaborate further. There's no mention of proposals or specific arguments beyond the criticism. \n\nSince the user says to only include points attributed to the speaker, and the summary only mentions his criticism without details, the response should reflect that. The example given in the user's prompt has specific points, but in this case, the information is limited. \n\nSo, the JSON should have the issueSum as \"criticism of bureaucratic control\", positionSum as \"criticized the EU's approach for excessive bureaucratic control\", argSum might be \"based on the belief that excessive bureaucracy hinders efficiency and innovation\", but wait, the original summary doesn't mention reasons. The original text only states his criticism without explaining why. So maybe the argSum is empty or just the position. \n\nWait, the user's example has \"His support for strict limitations... is based on a need to prevent improper use.\" But in the given debate summary, there's no explanation of why Titford criticizes bureaucratic control. The summary only states that he did. So, perhaps the argSum would be empty or just restate the position. However, the user's instructions say to include arguments used to justify positions. If there's no justification given, then argSum would be an empty string. \n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nissueSum: \"The key issue raised by the speaker relates to excessive bureaucratic control within the EU.\"\npositionSum: \"He criticized the EU's approach for being characterized by bureaucratic control.\"\nargSum: \"The argument is not detailed in the provided summary, but his position is based on the belief that bureaucratic control is detrimental.\"\npropSum: \"No specific proposals are mentioned in the summary.\"\n\nBut wait, the user's example has \"propSum\" as a summary of proposals. Since the summary doesn't mention any proposals from Titford, propSum would be empty. However, the user's example includes a propSum even if it's a brief statement. But in this case, there's no mention of proposals. \n\nSo, the final JSON would have:\n\n{\n  \"issueSum\": \"The key issue raised by the speaker relates to excessive bureaucratic control within the EU.\",\n  \"positionSum\": \"He criticized the EU's approach for being characterized by bureaucratic control.\",\n  \"argSum\": \"\",\n  \"propSum\": \"\"\n}\n\nBut I need to check if the user's example allows for empty strings. The user said if there are no points, respond with an empty string. So, since the summary only mentions his criticism without further arguments or proposals, the argSum and propSum would be empty. The issueSum and positionSum would capture the criticism.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The key issue raised by the speaker relates to excessive bureaucratic control within the EU.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"He criticized the EU's approach for being characterized by bureaucratic control.\",\n\"argSum\": \"\",\n\"propSum\": \"\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "John Bowis (PPE-DE). \u2013", "english": "John Bowis (PPE-DE). \u2013 Mr President, I am sorry that President Barroso has been summoned by the Belgian authorities.

The proposal is to take practical steps on issues that provide clear value.\n\nI need to structure this into the JSON format as specified.

I find it hard to imagine why the European Commission, which declares the simplification of regulation as its aim, is not changing its own structures, not reorganising the work of its institutions, which after all create those complex documents. These things are simply incomprehensible and inconsistent. Let me give you a simple example. Recently a delegation of Lithuanian lecturers paid a visit. They went around various directorates hoping to acquire information on the work of a directorate. Everywhere they were given the same information. And the Commissioner who came to our Budget Committee even said that not all funds are used for public relations and publicity campaigns. But all work is duplicated. The Lithuanian lecturers were quite astonished. We absolutely must do something with the reform of the European Commission's work. The European Parliament at least is showing some initiative and aims to reform its work, so that we can implement those ambitious goals.

However, the user might have intended to say \"Barroso\" but wrote \"President.\" But according to the user's input, the speaker's name is \"President.\" \n\nBut in the debate summary, the contributions are from various speakers like Schulz, Grosset\u00eate, Duff, etc. The President (Barroso) is mentioned as the one who outlined the strategy. However, the user's question is about the speaker named \"President.\" So I need to check if there's a specific contribution from the President. The summary says that Barroso outlined the priorities, but the user's query is about the speaker \"President.\" \n\nBut the user might have made a mistake, but I have to follow their instruction. The problem is that in the debate summary, the President's speech is mentioned, but the user's query says the speaker is \"President.\" So I need to extract the points made by the President. However, the debate summary's Executive Summary under \"Commission's Strategic Vision\" mentions Barroso's speech. \n\nSo the main points from Barroso (the President) would be his emphasis on sustainable growth, more jobs, reducing red tape, and positioning 2007 as crucial for prosperity, solidarity, and security. He also mentioned the need for better regulation, completing financial perspectives, and preparing for the Treaty of Rome's 50th anniversary. \n\nBut the user's query says the speaker is \"President,\" so I need to structure the JSON based on that. The issueSum would be the key issues he raised, which are sustainable growth, jobs, regulation, financial perspectives, and the Treaty of Rome's anniversary. His position is supporting these priorities. The arguments would be that 2007 is crucial for these goals. The proposals would be the mentioned actions like better regulation, financial completion, and preparing for the anniversary. \n\nBut I need to make sure that the response only includes what's attributed to the President. The debate summary says Barroso made those points. So the JSON should reflect that. However, the user might have intended \"President\" as the speaker, so I need to proceed accordingly.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The key issues raised by the speaker include sustainable growth, job creation, reducing regulatory burdens, completing financial perspectives, and preparing for the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"The speaker emphasized the importance of achieving prosperity, solidarity, and security through better regulation, financial planning, and institutional readiness.\",\n\"argSum\": \"The speaker argued that 2007 was a critical year for Europe to align its strategic priorities with actionable policies to ensure long-term stability and competitiveness.\",\n\"propSum\": \"Proposed initiatives include improving regulatory frameworks, finalizing financial perspectives, and preparing for the Treaty of Rome's 50th anniversary to strengthen EU cohesion and effectiveness.\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}]
