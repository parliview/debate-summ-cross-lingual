I am sure if he parks his car more carefully in future he will be able to stay until the end of our debates, but no doubt the message will be taken back to him.\nI welcome the title of this document: \u2018boosting trust through action\u2019. Sometimes you boost trust through action, and sometimes by non-action. Sometimes it is by withdrawing action, by sunset clauses, by reviews, and it is always by checking the small print of the proposals. We do nothing to boost confidence among our electors by having silly stories as we have had in the United Kingdom this week about church organs, and the European Union\u2019s intention under the WEEE Directive to ban church organ repairs and building because of the lead content. That is daft and I hope if there is any threat of that there will be a swift telephone call from the Vatican to say that St\u00a0Peter\u2019s Basilica will not stand for such nonsense. However, that is the small print.\nI believe we should be reconnecting with our constituents, we should relocate that purpose of our European venture and we should communicate it to the public. You do that for example by the next debate on energy, by showing that we are working together in solidarity to face any threats that there may be.\nMontesquieu has been quoted.
