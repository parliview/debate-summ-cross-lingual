{"speaker": "Malcolm Harbour (PPE-DE). \u2013", "english": "Malcolm Harbour (PPE-DE). \u2013 Mr President, when I spoke on the Commission\u2019s policy strategy at the end of last year, I commented on the fact that we had no sense whatsoever of priorities in that strategy. We have 62\u00a0priorities in this splendid new document. I also see that we have now proceeded from \u2018moving up a gear\u2019 to \u2018boosting trust through action\u2019. I am not sure whether Mrs Wallstr\u00f6m is still there, and I do not know whether she is responsible for inventing these wonderful phrases, but we need a much more structured and practical strategy approach from the Commission than these gimmicky words.\nI also observe in here, Mr Barroso, that you are going to \u2018take delivery up to cruising speed\u2019! Well frankly, that means that at the moment things are proceeding at a walking pace. We want some take-off from the Commission, not just cruising along. The problem with your strategy is not that we are short of new ideas or new initiatives, but we are actually short of real delivery of the policies that are going to create the jobs and growth of which you are so fond. Where is there a sense in here that you are putting some real resources and priorities into sorting out the problems of the internal market? There is a little paragraph in here that you are going to streamline the regulatory approach, that is great, but where is it in your priority actions?\nYou used a great phrase \u2013 and I applaud you for it \u2013 about putting out the red carpet for small enterprises. There is not one single priority action, President Barroso, that mentions small enterprises. So, it is very welcome that we are having a debate about this, but we need better-quality material; we need material that is much more focused on real strategy and resource utilisation, rather than on these gimmicky words that Mrs Wallstr\u00f6m appears to be giving you. We want something with a real sense that you are putting priorities on delivering the real foundations of the European Union and making the internal market work better, and not just coming out with a whole set of uncosted priorities that look good on paper but in respect of which there is no idea as to whether they are really going to work in practice.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Malcolm Harbour (PPE-DE). \u2013 Mr President, when I spoke on the Commission\u2019s policy strategy at the end of last year, I commented on the fact that we had no sense whatsoever of priorities in that strategy.
