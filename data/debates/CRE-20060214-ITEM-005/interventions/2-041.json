Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur for the very good work done on this proposal.

We can therefore say that with the adoption of this regulation the legislative component of our integrated border management strategy is fully completed; and, if I may say so, I very much hope that we will continue to work together effectively in the future, for instance on the decision-making process and on other very sensitive issues such as the legal basis for the VIS and SIS.\nThe adoption of this proposal will be a very important and balanced step forward, as it will provide the necessary flexibility at our external borders to facilitate crossings by bone fide people residing in a border area without, however, creating any security loopholes. This is particularly important for the new Member States, especially in view of their forthcoming integration into the Schengen area, where they will become responsible for the control of the Schengen external borders and will thus carry out checks on behalf of all Schengen states.\nIn this context I wish to recall that the adoption of Community rules on local border traffic is included in the much broader European neighbourhood strategy. It is thus one of the measures aimed at strengthening cross-border cooperation with the EU neighbours and people-to-people contact.\nFinally I conclude by stressing again that the text that is under examination today is a very balanced and important proposal.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Franco Frattini, Vice-President of the Commission .
