{"speaker": "Franco Frattini,", "english": "Franco Frattini, Vice-President of the Commission . Mr President, I would like again to thank the rapporteur, the shadow rapporteurs and all the speakers. Thanks to the contribution of each institution, the balance between facilitation on the one hand and security on the other has been maintained and this regulation, as was rightly said, will also be very helpful in strengthening the local development of important European regions near to the external borders.\nThe introduction of a specific local border traffic permit for border residents will help in identifying those people who have the right to benefit from the facilitated border crossing regime. Member States will have the right to scrutinise carefully people requesting this permit. However, I think that is fully justified by the advantages deriving from such a permit.\nFirst of all, holders of the permit will no longer need to be in possession of a visa, and a visa exemption for the holders of a local border traffic permit will be included very soon in the forthcoming Commission proposal revising the relevant visa regulation which I will put forward by the end of March. Later in the spring I will also present the new document on the common consular instruction for issuing a visa. On the basis of this regulation, Member States will be able to provide some practical facilitation such as specific border crossing points reserved for border residents and give them the possibility in very exceptional cases to cross the border outside authorised border crossing points.\nTo counterbalance that, Member States will have to ensure regular surveillance of border areas in order to avoid the misuse of the local border traffic regime and provide for specific sanctions.\nFinally, the Commission will report on the implementation of the local border traffic regime two years after the entry into force of the regulation, proposing modifications if necessary.\nI would like to conclude my remarks by stressing that I very much hope Parliament will confirm with its vote its support for the proposal made by the rapporteur, and I will encourage the Council to do the same as soon as possible.\n(Applause)", "lang": "EN", "original": "Franco Frattini, Vice-President of the Commission .
