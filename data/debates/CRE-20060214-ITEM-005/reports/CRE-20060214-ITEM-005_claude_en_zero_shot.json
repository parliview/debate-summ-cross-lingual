Given that the original material \u2013 the Commission\u2019s proposal \u2013 placed serious demands on the people who live along the European Union\u2019s external borders, in this report I have highlighted the following:\nWe need to make crossing the border easier for local residents who have good reasons for making frequent crossings of a Member State\u2019s external border, and we need to prevent illegal migration and the potential security threat posed by criminal activities. The proposed regulation seeks to regulate the issue of local border traffic, which involves frequent, sometimes daily, crossing of the border for the reasons of attending school, work, or family ties, and we therefore need to take into account that these daily migrants return each day to their homes.\nOwing in part to historical, geographical and social circumstances, the external borders differ, and life along the border should not be allowed to deteriorate. We need to consider the actual circumstances on the external borders and enable Member States to the greatest possible extent to maintain the good practices that they have established to date through bilateral agreements.\nThe essence of the amendments which I propose and which are in the text:\nInstead of the special \u2018L visa\u2019, local border residents will be issued a so-called local border traffic permit , which will incorporate all the security standards, and most importantly, will not be stamped upon every crossing of the border. A differentiation between the various external land borders will not be necessary, since in the coming years Member States will sooner or later enter into the Schengen area.\nThe local border area \u2013 this definition has triggered considerable debate. We have agreed that it should not exceed 30 km, and possibly 50 km in exceptional cases. Indeed by increasing the border area, we could find that it would no longer be possible to meet security standards. In no way, however, is it possible to equate local border areas with ethnic boundaries. A local border resident is a citizen of a third country who has resided for at least one year in the border area, while in the debate we have harmonised the proposal containing a whole range of exceptions involving marriage, inheritance and so forth.\nIn bilateral agreements Member States lay down the longest permitted period of residence, which may not exceed three months in total. In other words, this is a decision whereby an individual from a third country may reside in that border zone for three months in total. Where special circumstances are involved, certain privileges need to be permitted with regard to crossing the border outside established border crossings. There are, for instance, farmers that have half of the property they own in their own country and half in another country, and of course they cannot take their implements with them every time they cross the border.\nThe adoption of this regulation will show that the European Union is not closing its borders, and is not setting up inhuman conditions along its external borders. The European Union wishes to ensure adherence to the relevant security standards, but in no way to make life harder along the border. The coexistence of people on both sides of the border and their cooperation are important elements of stability and security along the external borders. For this reason another extremely important achievement of this regulation is that through bilateral agreements with neighbouring countries, in other words third countries, Member States will create the conditions for the development of border areas, which are for the most part less well developed.\nThis regulation provides a basis for the strengthening of economic, cultural and other ties on both sides of the border, so it is important for the border countries as well as for the European Union as a whole.

Glede na to, da je bilo prvotno gradivo - predlog Komisije - precej zahtevno za ljudi, ki \u017eivijo ob zunanjih mejah Evropske unije, sem v svojem poro\u010dilu izpostavil naslednje:\nTreba je olaj\u0161ati prehod meje obmejnim prebivalcem, ki imajo utemeljene razloge za pogosto prehajanje zunanje meje dr\u017eave \u010dlanice, in prepre\u010diti nezakonito priseljevanje ter morebitno ogro\u017eanje varnosti, ki ga predstavljajo kriminalne dejavnosti.

Nikakor pa ni mogo\u010de obmejnega obmo\u010dja ena\u010diti z etni\u010dnimi mejami. Obmejni prebivalec je dr\u017eavljan tretje dr\u017eave, ki prebiva na obmejnem obmo\u010dju najmanj eno leto, s tem da smo v razpravi uskladili predlog, ki vsebuje celo vrsto izjem, ko gre za poroko, dedovanje in tako naprej.\nDr\u017eave \u010dlanice v dvostranskih sporazumih dolo\u010dijo najdalj\u0161e dovoljeno obdobje bivanja, ki pa ne sme presegati treh mesecev skupaj, se pravi, da gre za odlo\u010ditev, da posameznik iz tretje dr\u017eave lahko skupaj biva v tem obmejnem pasu tri mesece. \u010ce gre za posebne okoli\u0161\u010dine, je potrebno dopustiti tudi dolo\u010dene olaj\u0161ave glede prestopa meje izven mejnih prehodov. Obstajajo, recimo, kmetje, ki so dvolastniki, pol premo\u017eenja imajo v svoji domovini, pol v drugi dr\u017eavi, in seveda ne morejo prehajati meje vsaki\u010d s svojim orodjem.\nSprejem te uredbe bo pokazal, da Evropska unija ne zapira svojih meja, da ob svojih zunanjih mejah ne postavlja ne\u017eivljenjskih pogojev.

At the same time, they must also be as flexible as possible, in order not to impose needless restrictions on businesses in the border regions and on the people who live there.\nFor that to happen, two things are required. One is integrated administration of the border, an administration shared by the customs authorities and the border police, something that cannot, unfortunately, always be guaranteed, but this integrated administration must also be shared with the neighbouring countries. The fact is that a border is truly secure and flexible only when those on both sides of it work as closely as possible together, and it is certainly one of the tasks of our new neighbourhood policy to get this aspect of bilateral security addressed by both sides jointly.\nThe other thing we need to do is to create a \u2018frontier worker\u2019s card\u2019 \u2013 \u2018local border traffic permit\u2019 is a splendid term, but a very long and bureaucratic-sounding one \u2013 for those people who live on the border and have to cross it frequently.

Denn wirklich sicher und flexibel ist eine Grenze nur dann, wenn beide Seiten m\u00f6glichst eng zusammenwirken, und es ist sicherlich auch eine der Aufgaben unserer neuen Nachbarschaftspolitik, diesen Teil der beiderseitigen Sicherheit gemeinsam in die Hand zu nehmen.\nZweitens geh\u00f6rt hierzu, dass wir einen Grenzg\u00e4ngerausweis schaffen \u2013 das sch\u00f6ne Wort \u201eGrenz\u00fcbertrittsgenehmigung\u201c klingt auf Deutsch au\u00dferordentlich lang und b\u00fcrokratisch.

These borders must be as secure as possible, and that will require the use of the most modern technologies. At the same time, they must also be as flexible as possible, in order not to impose needless restrictions on businesses in the border regions and on the people who live there.\nFor that to happen, two things are required. One is integrated administration of the border, an administration shared by the customs authorities and the border police, something that cannot, unfortunately, always be guaranteed, but this integrated administration must also be shared with the neighbouring countries. The fact is that a border is truly secure and flexible only when those on both sides of it work as closely as possible together, and it is certainly one of the tasks of our new neighbourhood policy to get this aspect of bilateral security addressed by both sides jointly.\nThe other thing we need to do is to create a \u2018frontier worker\u2019s card\u2019 \u2013 \u2018local border traffic permit\u2019 is a splendid term, but a very long and bureaucratic-sounding one \u2013 for those people who live on the border and have to cross it frequently.

The regulation on local border traffic that we now have before us has proved to be very important to the EU\u2019s external border regions, especially in the east. Traditionally, such border districts are often viewed as peripheral and as being marked by slow development. Believing that to be the case can easily bring that very situation about. It is therefore a question of giving clear signals to the border area populations to the effect that they must be allowed to have contacts in all directions and that their horizons are not to be bounded by their countries\u2019 borders.\nBeing able to move smoothly across borders is the basis for contacts, friendship, trade and creative innovation. There are no doubt many people living on, for example, the Russian-Estonian border or the Slovenian-Croatian border who will be grateful for the very flexible solution now being proposed.\nWhen it comes to promoting contacts between people, consistency is required. It is not consistent to begin, as now, by taking positive steps regarding local border traffic and similarly positive steps in the form of the bilateral visa agreement with Russia reached in October of last year, and then almost to double the visa charge from EUR\u00a035 to EUR\u00a065, something that the Council of Ministers is in actual fact in a quandary about taking a decision on next week in response to a proposal by France. If that decision is taken, it will not of course be long before the Russian side too increases the charge to approximately the same amount. It goes without saying that this would deal a heavy blow to tourism on the borders. For example, anyone in Eastern Finland wanting to cross by boat to the Russian side of the Saima Canal would be forced to pay more in visa charges than for the crossing itself. Doubling the charge would be wholly contrary to our objective where visa policy is concerned. There is no more effective way of putting a stop to natural contacts between people than by implementing such a shock increase in the cost of a visa. The fact is that the trend should be in the opposite direction.\nI therefore call on all my fellow Members to put this period to good use and, at the eleventh hour, to contact their governments in order to forestall this decision. The right hand needs to know what the left hand is doing. We must live up to our values.

The regulation on local border traffic that we now have before us has proved to be very important to the EU\u2019s external border regions, especially in the east. Traditionally, such border districts are often viewed as peripheral and as being marked by slow development. Believing that to be the case can easily bring that very situation about. It is therefore a question of giving clear signals to the border area populations to the effect that they must be allowed to have contacts in all directions and that their horizons are not to be bounded by their countries\u2019 borders.\nBeing able to move smoothly across borders is the basis for contacts, friendship, trade and creative innovation. There are no doubt many people living on, for example, the Russian-Estonian border or the Slovenian-Croatian border who will be grateful for the very flexible solution now being proposed.\nWhen it comes to promoting contacts between people, consistency is required. It is not consistent to begin, as now, by taking positive steps regarding local border traffic and similarly positive steps in the form of the bilateral visa agreement with Russia reached in October of last year, and then almost to double the visa charge from EUR\u00a035 to EUR\u00a065, something that the Council of Ministers is in actual fact in a quandary about taking a decision on next week in response to a proposal by France. If that decision is taken, it will not of course be long before the Russian side too increases the charge to approximately the same amount. It goes without saying that this would deal a heavy blow to tourism on the borders. For example, anyone in Eastern Finland wanting to cross by boat to the Russian side of the Saima Canal would be forced to pay more in visa charges than for the crossing itself. Doubling the charge would be wholly contrary to our objective where visa policy is concerned. There is no more effective way of putting a stop to natural contacts between people than by implementing such a shock increase in the cost of a visa. The fact is that the trend should be in the opposite direction.\nI therefore call on all my fellow Members to put this period to good use and, at the eleventh hour, to contact their governments in order to forestall this decision. The right hand needs to know what the left hand is doing. We must live up to our values. As Mrs\u00a0Klamt too emphasised recently, we must not give sustenance to the idea that the EU is constructing walls around itself."}, {"speaker": "Jarom\u00edr Kohl\u00ed\u010dek,", "english": "Jarom\u00edr Kohl\u00ed\u010dek, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group . \u2013 ( CS ) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with the previous speaker that if we adopt this text we will have to do all we can to prevent governments from torpedoing it. In 1957, when the six Member States of the European Community accepted the Treaties of Rome, it seemed that the achievement of the so-called four freedoms, which is to say the free movement of goods, capital, services and persons, was only a distant prospect. After the introduction of the so-called Schengen system, the removal of customs barriers between the Member States of the EU and the implementation of a series of measures to regulate relations between states in the area in question, the realisation of this goal came a lot closer.

A great deal will depend on how the Member States themselves implement the provisions of this regulation, however. Other factors to take into account will be the size of the target group of beneficiaries of these movements, and whether the reasons for which the new regime is introduced reflect those highlighted in the proposal for a regulation. I refer to social, family and cultural cohesion and to economic cooperation. Neighbouring countries will also be challenged to ensure full reciprocity of the effective implementation of readmission agreements.\nDuring the introduction of the local border traffic regime, it will be incumbent on the Member States to act very responsibly so as to ensure that the new BIS system does not benefit cross-border crime, smuggling or the organisation of illegal immigration. Clearly, therefore, the document we are debating is simply paving the way for the regulation of local border traffic across our external borders. Its implementation in the field must be constantly monitored. It will be necessary to establish whether it is actually worthwhile in terms of real benefits for communities living in border areas, whilst also complying with security requirements. The outcome of this assessment may vary in the various Member States located on the Union\u2019s external borders.\nIn conclusion, if we really want to engage in a serious discussion on integrated solutions to make our external borders more user-friendly to travellers who are third country nationals, whilst retaining essential security requirements, we ought to ensure that all the institutions and Member States are working together to ensure full implementation of the Schengen acquis by the 10\u00a0new Member States as soon as possible. The latter\u2019s visa policy towards their neighbours should become much more transparent once they are able to issue short-term Schengen visas.\nIn addition, there should be joint discussion of the possibility of wider use of national multiple entry long-term visas in cases where the implementation of the proposed local border movement provisions is not viable or attractive to the border community.

A great deal will depend on how the Member States themselves implement the provisions of this regulation, however. Other factors to take into account will be the size of the target group of beneficiaries of these movements, and whether the reasons for which the new regime is introduced reflect those highlighted in the proposal for a regulation. I refer to social, family and cultural cohesion and to economic cooperation. Neighbouring countries will also be challenged to ensure full reciprocity of the effective implementation of readmission agreements.\nDuring the introduction of the local border traffic regime, it will be incumbent on the Member States to act very responsibly so as to ensure that the new BIS system does not benefit cross-border crime, smuggling or the organisation of illegal immigration. Clearly, therefore, the document we are debating is simply paving the way for the regulation of local border traffic across our external borders. Its implementation in the field must be constantly monitored. It will be necessary to establish whether it is actually worthwhile in terms of real benefits for communities living in border areas, whilst also complying with security requirements. The outcome of this assessment may vary in the various Member States located on the Union\u2019s external borders.\nIn conclusion, if we really want to engage in a serious discussion on integrated solutions to make our external borders more user-friendly to travellers who are third country nationals, whilst retaining essential security requirements, we ought to ensure that all the institutions and Member States are working together to ensure full implementation of the Schengen acquis by the 10\u00a0new Member States as soon as possible. The latter\u2019s visa policy towards their neighbours should become much more transparent once they are able to issue short-term Schengen visas.\nIn addition, there should be joint discussion of the possibility of wider use of national multiple entry long-term visas in cases where the implementation of the proposed local border movement provisions is not viable or attractive to the border community. I have in mind cases in which the community is seeking access to the entire territory of the neighbouring country, not just to a small, clearly defined area."}, {"speaker": "Kinga G\u00e1l (PPE-DE). \u2013", "english": "Kinga G\u00e1l (PPE-DE). \u2013 (HU) I welcome the draft regulation to be accepted today, and congratulate the rapporteur for contributing to the preparation of a better text that really serves the purpose for which it has been created.\nThis regulation is particularly important to us, Hungarians, as it ensures a further form of contact for Hungarians living in the border areas in neighbouring countries, and it makes their everyday life easier.

Debate Information\n\n**Date:** February 14, 2006  \n**Topic:** Local border traffic regulation for EU external land borders  \n**Number of Contributions:** 16 contributions from various MEPs, Commission representatives, and parliamentary officials  \n**Report:** A6-0406/2005 by Mihael Brejc on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs\n\n## 2. Executive Summary\n\nThe debate centered on a proposed EU regulation to establish common rules for local border traffic at the Union's external land borders, balancing security concerns with the need to facilitate cross-border movement for legitimate border residents.\n\n### Commission Position\n\n**Franco Frattini**, Vice-President of the Commission, strongly supported the regulation as \"a very important and balanced step forward, as it will provide the necessary flexibility at our external borders to facilitate crossings by bone fide people residing in a border area without, however, creating any security loopholes\" [Frattini, 2006-02-14]. He emphasized that the regulation completes the legislative component of the EU's integrated border management strategy and is part of the broader European neighbourhood strategy.\n\n### Rapporteur's Approach\n\n**Mihael Brejc (PPE-DE)**, the rapporteur, outlined key amendments to the original Commission proposal. He advocated for replacing special 'L visas' with local border traffic permits that \"incorporate all the security standards, and most importantly, will not be stamped upon every crossing of the border\" [Brejc, 2006-02-14]. Brejc defined local border areas as maximum 30km (exceptionally 50km) and established that local border residents must have resided in the area for at least one year, with bilateral agreements allowing stays up to three months total. He emphasized that \"the adoption of this regulation will show that the European Union is not closing its borders, and is not setting up inhuman conditions along its external borders\" [Brejc, 2006-02-14].\n\n### Cross-Party Support\n\nThe regulation received broad cross-party support, with speakers emphasizing different aspects:\n\n**Karl von Wogau (PPE-DE)** stressed that \"freedom without security is nothing\" and argued that \"a border is truly secure and flexible only when those on both sides of it work as closely as possible together\" [von Wogau, 2006-02-14]. He advocated for integrated border administration and cooperation with neighboring countries.\n\n**Ewa Klamt (PPE-DE)** supported the balanced approach, stating \"we do not want Europe to be a fortress, but rather a community that coexists amicably with its neighbours\" [Klamt, 2006-02-14].\n\n**Michael Cashman (PSE)** praised the regulation as being about \"making people's lives easier and improving the daily lives of our citizens\" [Cashman, 2006-02-14] and advocated for a pragmatic approach to legislative amendments.\n\n### Regional and Security Concerns\n\nSeveral speakers from new Member States highlighted specific concerns:\n\n**Henrik Lax (ALDE)** warned against proposed visa fee increases that would contradict the regulation's objectives, stating \"there is no more effective way of putting a stop to natural contacts between people than by implementing such a shock increase in the cost of a visa\" [Lax, 2006-02-14].\n\n**Jarom\u00edr Kohl\u00ed\u010dek (GUE/NGL)** emphasized that \"it is in our own interests to ensure that we are as open as possible towards our neighbours\" and viewed the regulation as signaling \"whether or not the EU wants to be an open society or to erect barriers against neighbouring states along its borders\" [Kohl\u00ed\u010dek, 2006-02-14].\n\n**Istv\u00e1n Szent-Iv\u00e1nyi (ALDE)** addressed concerns of new Member States about \"a new Iron Curtain\" falling on Eastern borders, praising the regulation as \"more favourable in every respect than the original proposal of the Commission\" [Szent-Iv\u00e1nyi, 2006-02-14].\n\n### Implementation and Security Safeguards\n\n**Andreas M\u00f6lzer (NI)** supported common rules while allowing bilateral agreements, emphasizing that \"while we must of course make matters simpler and easier for cross-border residents, the option of imposing strict sanctions must be in place to ensure that the concessions made are not abused\" [M\u00f6lzer, 2006-02-14].\n\n**Barbara Kudrycka (PPE-DE)** stressed the need for responsible implementation, warning that Member States must \"act very responsibly so as to ensure that the new BIS system does not benefit cross-border crime, smuggling or the organisation of illegal immigration\" [Kudrycka, 2006-02-14].\n\n### Minority Communities and Bilateral Relations\n\n**Genowefa Grabowska (PSE)** from Poland welcomed the regulation format, stating it ensures \"our closest neighbours will be able to enter the Union, albeit for a short time, with their heads held high, instead of on their knees as has been the case to date\" [Grabowska, 2006-02-14].\n\n**Kinga G\u00e1l (PPE-DE)** highlighted the regulation's importance for Hungarian minorities in neighboring countries, noting it \"ensures a further form of contact for Hungarians living in the border areas in neighbouring countries, and it makes their everyday life easier\" [G\u00e1l, 2006-02-14].\n\n### Commission Commitments\n\nIn closing, **Frattini** committed to including visa exemptions for local border traffic permit holders in upcoming Commission proposals by March 2006 and emphasized that \"Member States will have to ensure regular surveillance of border areas in order to avoid the misuse of the local border traffic regime and provide for specific sanctions\" [Frattini, 2006-02-14].\n\nThe debate demonstrated unanimous parliamentary support for balancing border security with cross-border community needs, with the regulation viewed as a model for EU openness toward neighboring countries while maintaining necessary security standards.", "src_model": "claude", "model_type": "claude", "model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "structured": false, "incremental": false, "hierarchical": false, "grouped": false, "shuffle": false, "prompt": false, "lang": "english"}
