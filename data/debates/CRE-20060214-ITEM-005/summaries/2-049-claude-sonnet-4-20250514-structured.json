This is a well-balanced proposal which will not only facilitate traditional population movements at border crossings, but will also guarantee appropriate security levels at the EU\u2019s external borders.\nIllegal immigration and potential threats to security posed by criminal activities must be thwarted. There is also a need to facilitate local border traffic, that is, to facilitate crossing for border residents with legitimate reasons to cross the border frequently.\nOur efforts to increase security at our external borders, not least by means of the adoption of the second generation of the Schengen Information System (SIS), sends out a positive political message. Borders must not act as a barrier to commercial, social and cultural interaction or to regional cooperation.
