{"speaker": "Henrik Lax,", "english": "Henrik Lax, on behalf of the ALDE Group. \u2013 (SV) Mr\u00a0President, I too wish to thank the rapporteur for his very constructive work. The regulation on local border traffic that we now have before us has proved to be very important to the EU\u2019s external border regions, especially in the east. Traditionally, such border districts are often viewed as peripheral and as being marked by slow development. Believing that to be the case can easily bring that very situation about. It is therefore a question of giving clear signals to the border area populations to the effect that they must be allowed to have contacts in all directions and that their horizons are not to be bounded by their countries\u2019 borders.\nBeing able to move smoothly across borders is the basis for contacts, friendship, trade and creative innovation. There are no doubt many people living on, for example, the Russian-Estonian border or the Slovenian-Croatian border who will be grateful for the very flexible solution now being proposed.\nWhen it comes to promoting contacts between people, consistency is required. It is not consistent to begin, as now, by taking positive steps regarding local border traffic and similarly positive steps in the form of the bilateral visa agreement with Russia reached in October of last year, and then almost to double the visa charge from EUR\u00a035 to EUR\u00a065, something that the Council of Ministers is in actual fact in a quandary about taking a decision on next week in response to a proposal by France. If that decision is taken, it will not of course be long before the Russian side too increases the charge to approximately the same amount. It goes without saying that this would deal a heavy blow to tourism on the borders. For example, anyone in Eastern Finland wanting to cross by boat to the Russian side of the Saima Canal would be forced to pay more in visa charges than for the crossing itself. Doubling the charge would be wholly contrary to our objective where visa policy is concerned. There is no more effective way of putting a stop to natural contacts between people than by implementing such a shock increase in the cost of a visa. The fact is that the trend should be in the opposite direction.\nI therefore call on all my fellow Members to put this period to good use and, at the eleventh hour, to contact their governments in order to forestall this decision. The right hand needs to know what the left hand is doing. We must live up to our values. As Mrs\u00a0Klamt too emphasised recently, we must not give sustenance to the idea that the EU is constructing walls around itself.", "lang": "SV", "original": "Henrik Lax, f\u00f6r ALDE-gruppen . \u2013 Herr talman! \u00c4ven jag vill tacka f\u00f6redraganden f\u00f6r ett mycket gott arbete. F\u00f6rordningen om lokal gr\u00e4nstrafik som vi nu har framf\u00f6r oss har visat sig vara mycket viktig f\u00f6r unionens yttre gr\u00e4nsregioner, fr\u00e4mst i \u00f6ster. Traditionellt sett uppfattas s\u00e5dana gr\u00e4nstrakter ofta som en periferi med en l\u00e5ngsam utveckling. Om man tror att det \u00e4r s\u00e5, f\u00f6rverkligas denna situation ocks\u00e5 l\u00e4tt. Det g\u00e4ller d\u00e4rf\u00f6r att ge klara signaler till gr\u00e4nsbefolkningen: \u201dNi skall f\u00e5 ha kontakter \u00e5t alla h\u00e5ll. Gr\u00e4nsen utg\u00f6r inte slutet f\u00f6r er.\u201d\nAtt kunna r\u00f6ra sig smidigt \u00f6ver gr\u00e4nserna \u00e4r grunden f\u00f6r kontakter, v\u00e4nskap, handel och skapande innovativitet. Det \u00e4r sannolikt m\u00e5nga m\u00e4nniskor bosatta vid till exempel den rysk-estniska gr\u00e4nsen liksom vid den slovensk-kroatiska gr\u00e4nsen som kommer att vara tacksamma f\u00f6r den mycket smidiga l\u00f6sning som nu f\u00f6resl\u00e5s.\nN\u00e4r det g\u00e4ller att fr\u00e4mja kontakter mellan m\u00e4nniskor m\u00e5ste man vara konsekvent. Det \u00e4r inte konsekvent att f\u00f6rst \u2013 som nu \u2013 ta positiva steg n\u00e4r det g\u00e4ller den lokala gr\u00e4nstrafiken och i det bilaterala visumavtalet med Ryssland som n\u00e5ddes i oktober i fjol, och att sedan n\u00e4stan f\u00f6rdubbla visumavgiften fr\u00e5n 35 till 65 euro, n\u00e5got som ministerr\u00e5det faktiskt st\u00e5r i ber\u00e5d att fatta beslut om n\u00e4sta vecka p\u00e5 f\u00f6rslag av Frankrike. Om detta beslut fattas, kommer det f\u00f6rst\u00e5s inte att dr\u00f6ja l\u00e4nge f\u00f6rr\u00e4n ocks\u00e5 den ryska sidan h\u00f6jer avgiften till ungef\u00e4r densamma. Det s\u00e4ger sig sj\u00e4lvt att detta sl\u00e5r h\u00e5rt mot gr\u00e4nsturismen. F\u00f6r att till exempel g\u00f6ra en b\u00e5tkryssning p\u00e5 Saima kanal i \u00f6stra Finland \u00f6ver till den ryska sidan kommer man att vara tvungen att betala mer i visumavgifter \u00e4n i kostnader f\u00f6r sj\u00e4lva kryssningen. F\u00f6rdubblingen av avgiften st\u00e5r helt i strid med den m\u00e5ls\u00e4ttning som vi har i visumpolitiken. Det finns inget mer effektivt s\u00e4tt att s\u00e4tta stopp f\u00f6r naturliga kontakter mellan m\u00e4nniskor \u00e4n en s\u00e5dan chockh\u00f6jning av avgiften. Riktningen borde ju vara den motsatta.\nJag uppmanar d\u00e4rf\u00f6r alla mina kolleger att utnyttja tiden och i sista stund kontakta sina regeringar f\u00f6r att stoppa detta beslut.
