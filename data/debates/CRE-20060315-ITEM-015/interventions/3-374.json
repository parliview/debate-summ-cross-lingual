{"speaker": "Neelie Kroes,", "english": "Neelie Kroes, Member of the Commission . Mr President, the Commission thanks the Committee on Legal Affairs for its question and Mr Lehne for doing a great job here this evening. He presented his views quite clearly.\nThe Commission recognises the special role of the legal sector in the good administration of justice and in promoting access to justice \u2013 by the way, in response to the example cited by Mr\u00a0Lehne, the Commission also recognises that supermarkets are very important and very honourable members of our community \u2013 we are certainly not challenging this. But we are saying that we need to look afresh at the current regulation of the sector to see what can be modernised to promote new types of services and new ways of doing things. That is in the interests of the users of these key services.\nSo we are proposing that Member States use a proportionality test to see how far current regulations are all really serving the public interest. This approach fully respects the subsidiarity principle. It allows for national circumstances, and the special characteristics of the legal sector, to be taken fully into account.\nThe Commission certainly agrees with the need for some regulation. I repeat: our initiative is about better regulation, not deregulation. We also recognise that it is the Member States\u2019 right to determine the balance between state rules and self-regulation by professional bodies.\nOn the question of the right of Member States to fix tariffs, I would underline the position of the Commission in its report of February 2004. In our view the Arduino judgment suggests that state measures delegating regulatory powers to professional bodies in order to fix tariffs can be challenged under the competition rules \u2013 for example, Articles 3(1)(g), 10(2) and 81 EC \u2013 if the state does not have the final word and exercise effective control of the implementation of these tariffs. We are expecting further clarification on this when the Court delivers its preliminary ruling in the Macrino case (case C-202/04).\nFinally, there are the internal market rules. These are at issue in another case pending before the European Court of Justice, the Cipolla case (case C-04/04), again concerning the Member States\u2019 responsibility for price fixing. The Commission considers that minimum prices for lawyers\u2019 services are a restriction on the freedom to provide services because they neutralise the competitive advantage of service providers from other Member States. Moreover, we see no justification for minimum prices under the proportionality test, since they do not per se guarantee quality, access to justice, or good ethical conduct.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Neelie Kroes, Member of the Commission .
