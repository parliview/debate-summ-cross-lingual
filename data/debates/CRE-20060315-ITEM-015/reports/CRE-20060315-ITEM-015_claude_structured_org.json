Nevertheless, it is an honour for me to do so.\nBefore I give detailed reasons for this question, I should like to say a few words about the background. The history of this issue, namely that of liberal professions, in particular legal professions \u2013 to whom this question relates \u2013 goes back several years. Parliament dealt with this issue in the previous parliamentary term on the basis of two questions for oral answer in the corresponding resolutions, particularly in the light of the activities of the Internal Market and Services Directorate General under Mario Monti, the former Commissioner for competition, and also in view of the study by the Vienna Institute for Advanced Studies that sparked off this whole debate.\nI do not wish to conceal the fact that the Committee on Legal Affairs actually always held a broad conviction \u2013 even across the political spectrum \u2013 that this Vienna study took a very biased approach, one biased towards economic aspects, and did not take sufficient account of the specific role of the liberal professions, particularly the legal professions, in administering justice. The Committee also feared \u2013 and this was borne out to some extent by the documents \u2013 that the Commission had not always drawn the correct conclusions from the documents of the Vienna study and, furthermore, was consciously conducting a policy that we doubted was the right course in the case of some particular issues. After all, liberal professions, with their particular importance, quite simply cannot be compared with the supermarket round the corner in terms of competition policy and competition law. Their origins are different, their importance to the functioning of society is different.\nPresenting another question for oral answer today, following the latest Commission interim report presented by Commissioner\u00a0Kroes \u2013 an accompanying resolution will follow in the coming week \u2013 practically continues the tradition from the previous parliamentary term.\nI should like to make it crystal clear at this juncture that we, too, are of course well aware that antiquated customs should be dispensed with. We are no longer living in the Middle Ages, and the guild system is a thing of the past. Nonetheless, particular account must of course be taken of the distinguishing features of the liberal professions: in particular the legal professions, which are what interests the Committee on Legal Affairs. These features form part of the judicial system, and have to function. If the system does not function, the public suffers, being afforded insufficient legal protection, and this means that an intrinsic part of democracy, namely the rule of law, is also called into question. That is why the rules for the liberal professions have to be scrutinised very carefully and in great detail, and why we have to consider carefully what is needed in order to afford legal protection and access to justice for all citizens that is as effective and safe as possible, including in practice. Naturally, this should be done with particular regard to the case law of the European Court of Justice.\nI should now like to turn to a specific problem which has, of course, also been addressed in conjunction with this question, and which was one of the reasons that the Committee on Legal Affairs wanted a further debate on this issue today in plenary. That problem is the specific role of tariffs in the liberal legal professions, since, in many EU Member States, these have a special nature and importance, especially in connection with the rules for reimbursement of legal expenses, and also in situations in which companies providing legal-expenses insurance wish to make reimbursements themselves on behalf of their clients. Such things are virtually impossible without tariffs, and are also deeply rooted in the legal traditions of many Member States. As such, they should not be called into question without good cause, because they also represent a fundamental aspect of consumer protection. This should be made quite clear at this juncture.\nThe case law of the European Court of Justice has taken great care when dealing with such issues in the past. Just recently \u2013 a few weeks ago \u2013 we saw a specific instance in which the Advocate General, too, attempted to show due care in such issues. It is very important to us that the Commission cease dealing with this fundamental issue \u2013 which is extremely important to the functioning of the legal professions in many Member States \u2013 in this way, as the Commission\u2019s documents would suggest. The Commission cannot treat the liberal professions in the same way as it does supermarkets. These professions have a special importance and role.\nSome EU Member States have now abolished tariffs and, interestingly, this has meant an increase in prices for lawyers and consumers, for example \u2013 in some cases they are considerably higher, on average, than those in Member States who still have such a system. Particularly with regard to the price trend, this system has ensured that legal protection for consumers continues to be accessible and financially sustainable.\nWe would now welcome a reply to our oral question from Commissioner\u00a0Kroes, who has already had the opportunity to discuss this issue with us in committee, on behalf of the Commission. We shall then have the opportunity to respond to it, both in the context of the debate and, in the coming week, in the context of the resolution.", "lang": "DE", "original": "Klaus-Heiner Lehne (PPE-DE), stellvertr. Verfasser . \u2013 Herr Pr\u00e4sident, meine sehr verehrten Damen und Herren! Ich vertrete hier eigentlich nur den Kollegen Gargani, der als Vorsitzender des Rechtsausschusses der eigentliche Verfasser dieser Anfrage ist. Aber es ist mir eine Ehre, dies zu tun.\nLassen Sie mich \u2013 bevor ich die Anfrage im Einzelnen begr\u00fcnde \u2013 etwas zur Vorgeschichte sagen. Dieses Thema, n\u00e4mlich freie Berufe und insbesondere freie Rechtsberufe, um die es bei dieser Anfrage geht, hat eine mehrj\u00e4hrige Vorgeschichte. In der zur\u00fcckliegenden Legislaturperiode hat sich das Europ\u00e4ische Parlament aufgrund zweier m\u00fcndlicher Anfragen in den entsprechenden Entschlie\u00dfungen mit diesem Thema befasst, und zwar vor allen Dingen vor dem Hintergrund der Aktivit\u00e4ten der Generaldirektion Binnenmarkt des damals f\u00fcr Wettbewerbsrecht zust\u00e4ndigen Kommissars Monti und auch vor dem Hintergrund des den Ausgang dieser ganzen Debatte darstellenden so genannten Wiener Gutachtens.\nIch will nicht verhehlen, dass wir im Rechtsausschuss eigentlich weitestgehend, sogar partei\u00fcbergreifend, immer \u00fcberzeugt waren, dass dieses so genannte Wiener Gutachten von seinem Ansatz her sehr einseitig war, einen einseitig \u00f6konomischen Ansatz verfolgt hat und die spezifische Rolle der freien Berufe, insbesondere der Rechtsberufe, als Organe der Rechtspflege nicht in einem ausreichenden Ma\u00dfe beachtet hat. Wir haben auch die gro\u00dfe Bef\u00fcrchtung gehabt \u2013 teilweise wurde das durch die Dokumente best\u00e4tigt\u00a0\u2013, dass die Kommission nicht immer die richtigen Schlussfolgerungen aus diesen Unterlagen des Wiener Gutachtens gezogen hat und ganz bewusst auch eine Politik betrieb, bei der wir in Einzelfragen Zweifel hatten, ob das der richtige Weg ist. Denn man kann nun mal ganz einfach freie Berufe in ihrer besonderen Bedeutung wettbewerbspolitisch und wettbewerbsrechtlich nicht mit dem Supermarkt um die Ecke vergleichen. Sie haben eine andere Herkunft, sie haben eine andere Bedeutung f\u00fcr das Funktionieren der Gesellschaft.\nWenn wir heute, nach dem letzten von Kommissarin Kroes vorgelegten Zwischenbericht der Kommission, eine erneute m\u00fcndliche Anfrage vorlegen \u2013 es wird in der n\u00e4chsten Woche auch eine Begleitentschlie\u00dfung geben\u00a0\u2013, so ist dies praktisch eine Fortsetzung dieser Tradition aus der vergangenen Legislaturperiode.\nIch will hier ganz deutlich machen, dass es auch aus unserer Sicht nat\u00fcrlich v\u00f6llig klar ist, dass alte Z\u00f6pfe abgeschnitten geh\u00f6ren. Wir leben nicht mehr im Mittelalter, und mit dem Zunftwesen ist es vorbei. Nichtsdestotrotz m\u00fcssen die Besonderheiten, die die freien Berufe \u2013 insbesondere die Rechtsberufe, um die es dem Rechtsausschuss geht \u2013 ausmachen, nat\u00fcrlich in einem besonderen Ma\u00dfe beachtet werden. Sie sind Bestandteil des Justizsystems und sie m\u00fcssen funktionieren. Wenn dies nicht funktioniert, ist das schlecht f\u00fcr den B\u00fcrger. Dann bekommt der B\u00fcrger keinen ausreichenden Rechtsschutz, und damit ist auch ein wesentlicher Bestandteil der Demokratie, n\u00e4mlich der Rechtsstaat, in Frage gestellt. Darum ist es erforderlich, sehr genau und sehr detailliert die Regelungen der freien Berufe zu pr\u00fcfen und sich genau zu \u00fcberlegen, was man braucht und was erforderlich ist, um einen m\u00f6glichst effektiven und sicheren Rechtsschutz und den Zugang zum Recht f\u00fcr alle B\u00fcrger auch tats\u00e4chlich zu erm\u00f6glichen, dies nat\u00fcrlich auch unter ganz besonderer Ber\u00fccksichtigung der Rechtsprechung des Europ\u00e4ischen Gerichtshofes.\nLassen Sie mich nun auf ein spezifisches Problem kommen, das mit dieser Anfrage nat\u00fcrlich auch angesprochen wurde und das im Rechtsausschuss mit Ursache daf\u00fcr war, dass wir dieses Thema heute erneut im Plenum behandelt haben m\u00f6chten. Das ist die spezifische Rolle der Geb\u00fchrenordnung bei den freien Rechtsberufen. Diese haben nun einmal einen ganz besonderen und bedeutenden Charakter in vielen Mitgliedstaaten der Europ\u00e4ischen Union, insbesondere wenn es um die Frage der Erstattungsregeln bei Gerichtsverfahren geht, als auch, wenn es darum geht, dass Rechtsschutzversicherungen von sich aus Erstattungen f\u00fcr ihre Klienten vornehmen wollen. So etwas ist praktisch ohne Geb\u00fchrenordnungen nicht m\u00f6glich und in der Rechtstradition vieler Mitgliedstaaten fest und tief verankert, so dass man nicht ohne Not daran r\u00fctteln sollte, weil dies auch einen wesentlichen Aspekt des Verbraucherschutzes darstellt. Dies sei an dieser Stelle ganz deutlich gesagt.\nDer Europ\u00e4ische Gerichtshof ist in seiner Rechtsprechung in der Vergangenheit sehr sorgf\u00e4ltig mit diesen Fragen umgegangen. Gerade jetzt hat auch der Generalanwalt in einem konkreten Fall vor wenigen Wochen versucht, in diesen Fragen eine entsprechende Sorgfalt an den Tag zu legen. F\u00fcr uns ist es ganz wichtig, dass dieser entscheidende Punkt, der f\u00fcr die Funktionsf\u00e4higkeit der Rechtsberufe in vielen Mitgliedstaaten von gro\u00dfer Bedeutung ist, nicht von der Kommission weiter in dieser Art und Weise \u2013 wie man aufgrund der Dokumente der Kommission den Eindruck haben konnte \u2013 behandelt wird. Die Kommission kann nun einmal die freien Berufe nicht so behandeln wie die Superm\u00e4rkte. Sie haben eine ganz besondere Bedeutung und Rolle.\nWir haben inzwischen Mitgliedstaaten in der Europ\u00e4ischen Union, die Geb\u00fchrenordnungen abgeschafft haben. Das Interessante ist, dass die Preise z.\u00a0B. f\u00fcr Anw\u00e4lte und f\u00fcr den normalen Verbraucher gestiegen sind und teilweise im Durchschnitt erheblich h\u00f6her als in den Mitgliedstaaten sind, die nach wie vor \u00fcber ein solches System verf\u00fcgen, obwohl dieses System insbesondere auch bei der Preisentwicklung daf\u00fcr gesorgt hat, dass Rechtsschutz f\u00fcr den Verbraucher weiter finanzierbar und erreichbar war.\nWir w\u00fcrden uns nun freuen, wenn Frau Kommissarin Kroes, die schon die Gelegenheit hatte, im Ausschuss mit uns \u00fcber diese Frage zu sprechen, von Seiten der Kommission unsere m\u00fcndliche Anfrage beantworten w\u00fcrde. Wir haben dann die M\u00f6glichkeit, im Rahmen der Debatte und in der n\u00e4chsten Woche im Rahmen der Entschlie\u00dfung darauf reagieren zu k\u00f6nnen.", "agenda_item": "Legal professions and general interest in the functioning of legal systems (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060315-ITEM-015", "intervention_id": "3-373", "summary_english": "```json\n{\n  \"headline\": \"European Parliament Legal Affairs Committee Questions Commission Approach to Liberal Legal Professions and Tariff Systems\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"The speaker addresses concerns about the European Commission's approach to liberal legal professions, particularly regarding competition policy and tariff systems.

The relationship between a solicitor or notary and their client affects the administration of justice, a sensitive issue in terms of democracy, as Mr Lehne has also pointed out.\nThe work of the professional associations of legal professions in the different countries is very beneficial to relations, not just corporate relations, but also those in defence of the public interest. The judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, which Mrs\u00a0Kroes is so keen to see, has so far recognised that systems such as the Spanish system conform to European legislation, whose fee rates are merely guidelines, rather than minimums, which help the judicial administration to set costs, which is ultimately always controlled judicially.\nNeither should the opposition of many lawyers from many countries to the quota litis pact be questioned. This pact violates the dignity of work and shows a lack of consideration and respect for the profession. The prohibition of the quota litis pact has also been accepted by the national courts, Mrs\u00a0Kroes.\nI would call upon the European Commission to respect the work of institutions which, like the colleges of lawyers and notaries, have generally speaking been working well for more than two centuries, despite the ups and downs and interruptions of history. Do not forget that constitutions, such as the Spanish Constitution, recognise the essential role of professional associations and the fundamental work they do.\nThe European Commission should be loyal to the European tradition, and not to the newer United States tradition.

La jurisprudencia del Tribunal de Justicia de las Comunidades Europeas, que tanto espera la se\u00f1ora Kroes, reconoce hasta ahora el respeto a la normativa europea de sistemas que, como el espa\u00f1ol, tienen tarifas de honorarios meramente orientativas, no m\u00ednimas, que sirven a la administraci\u00f3n de justicia para fijar la condena en costas, en definitiva controlada siempre judicialmente.\nTampoco deber\u00eda cuestionarse la oposici\u00f3n de los abogados de muchos pa\u00edses al pacto de quota litis . Ese pacto va contra la dignidad del trabajo y es una falta de consideraci\u00f3n y respeto para la profesi\u00f3n.

Generally, I do not see how wide-scale price fixing, even for in-court work, can be objectively justified for all consumers and business users. There may be certain limited circumstances in which price regulation is justified: for example, where there is a need to provide special protection for certain disadvantaged groups, including the lower paid.

I am not saying that removing price regulation or that lower levels of regulation will automatically lead to lower prices, more choice for consumers or the creation of new jobs.\nAs to the removal of price regulation in the UK leading to high legal costs, I am not aware of any evidence to show that price deregulation in the UK has meant problems for UK citizens in accessing legal advice and representation, or that UK legal fees have escalated disproportionately as a result.

Debate Information\n\n**Title:** Legal professions and general interest in the functioning of legal systems (debate)  \n**Number of Contributions:** 5 substantive contributions  \n**Topic:** EU regulation of legal professions, particularly concerning fee structures, competition rules, and access to justice  \n**Date:** Not specified in provided materials\n\n## 2. Executive Summary\n\nThis debate centered on the fundamental tension between protecting traditional legal profession structures and promoting competition to improve access to justice. The discussion revealed a clear divide between those defending established regulatory frameworks and those advocating for market-based reforms.\n\n### Key Issues and Positions\n\n**Klaus-Heiner Lehne (PPE-DE)** emerged as the strongest defender of traditional legal profession regulation. He argued that legal professions serve a unique constitutional role and should not be treated as ordinary commercial enterprises. Lehne specifically defended fee structures (Geb\u00fchrenordnungen), stating: \"Sie sind Bestandteil des Justizsystems und sie m\u00fcssen funktionieren. Wenn dies nicht funktioniert, ist das schlecht f\u00fcr den B\u00fcrger\" [Lehne]. He provided evidence that countries abolishing fee structures experienced price increases, while those maintaining them kept services affordable: \"Das Interessante ist, dass die Preise z. B. f\u00fcr Anw\u00e4lte und f\u00fcr den normalen Verbraucher gestiegen sind und teilweise im Durchschnitt erheblich h\u00f6her als in den Mitgliedstaaten sind, die nach wie vor \u00fcber ein solches System verf\u00fcgen\" [Lehne].\n\n**Antonio Masip Hidalgo** strongly supported Lehne's position, emphasizing respect for European legal traditions spanning over two centuries. He opposed treating legal relationships as simple commercial transactions, arguing: \"La Comisi\u00f3n Europea no debe tratar estos casos como si fueran una simple relaci\u00f3n mercantil entre cliente y proveedor de servicios\" [Masip Hidalgo]. He specifically defended prohibitions on contingency fee arrangements (quota litis), calling them contrary to professional dignity.\n\n**EU Commissioner Neelie Kroes** presented the Commission's position advocating for modernization through proportionality tests while respecting subsidiarity. She distinguished between deregulation and better regulation: \"our initiative is about better regulation, not deregulation\" [Kroes]. However, she strongly opposed minimum price restrictions, arguing they \"neutralise the competitive advantage of service providers from other Member States\" [Kroes]. In her second intervention, Kroes presented evidence from UK deregulation showing price falls of up to 24% in conveyancing without quality deterioration, advocating that \"Opening the way to greater competition in that sector will do just that; it will result in the emergence of new and innovative types of services\" [Kroes].\n\n**Diana Wallis** provided a consumer-focused perspective, prioritizing access to justice over professional protections. She argued: \"The public interest in access to justice must, I believe, be our overriding goal and not the protection or convenience of lawyers who may find it more comfortable to continue to provide services in the way they have always done\" [Wallis]. Interestingly, she praised Germany's fee scale system as enabling access to justice for small claims, demonstrating that even reform advocates recognized some regulated pricing benefits.\n\n### Core Arguments\n\n**Pro-regulation advocates** (Lehne, Masip Hidalgo) emphasized:\n- Legal professions' constitutional role in justice administration\n- Evidence of price increases following deregulation in some countries\n- Importance of professional dignity and traditional European institutional frameworks\n- Bar associations serving public interest, not just corporate interests\n\n**Pro-competition advocates** (Kroes) emphasized:\n- Evidence of consumer benefits from deregulation (UK price reductions)\n- Innovation and new service types emerging from competition\n- Better consumer choice through price comparison opportunities\n- Proportionality in regulation to serve genuine public interests\n\n### Proposals and Recommendations\n\nThe debate produced several actionable proposals:\n\n1. **Proportionality Testing:** The Commission proposed Member States use proportionality tests to evaluate current regulations, determining what genuinely serves public interest while respecting national circumstances.\n\n2. **Targeted Price Regulation:** Kroes suggested maintaining only \"very limited and targeted price regulation for disadvantaged groups like the lower paid\" while eliminating widespread price fixing.\n\n3. **Detailed Examination:** Lehne called for the Commission to \"carefully examine legal profession regulations in detail, considering what is necessary for effective and secure legal protection.\"\n\n4. **European Best Practices:** Wallis proposed examining \"various European models of legal service provision to identify and adopt the best practices that serve public interest.\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe debate highlighted an unresolved tension between preserving legal professions' traditional role in democratic institutions and promoting competition to improve consumer access and choice. While all speakers agreed on the importance of access to justice, they differed fundamentally on whether traditional regulatory structures or market competition better serves this goal. The Commission's balanced approach of \"better regulation\" through proportionality tests may offer a middle path, but implementation will require careful consideration of each Member State's specific legal traditions and circumstances.", "src_model": "claude", "model_type": "claude", "model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "structured": true, "incremental": false, "hierarchical": false, "grouped": false, "shuffle": false, "prompt": false, "lang": "original"}
