{"speaker": "Antonio Masip Hidalgo,", "english": "Antonio Masip Hidalgo, on behalf of the PSE Group . \u2013 (ES) Mr President, the question from the Committee on Legal Affairs is appropriate since relations between lawyers and notaries, and the legal professions in general \u2014 as Mr\u00a0Lehne has said \u2014 and their clients must be given special consideration.\nThe European Commission must not deal with these cases as if they were a question of a mere business relationship between client and service provider. The relationship between a solicitor or notary and their client affects the administration of justice, a sensitive issue in terms of democracy, as Mr Lehne has also pointed out.\nThe work of the professional associations of legal professions in the different countries is very beneficial to relations, not just corporate relations, but also those in defence of the public interest. The judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, which Mrs\u00a0Kroes is so keen to see, has so far recognised that systems such as the Spanish system conform to European legislation, whose fee rates are merely guidelines, rather than minimums, which help the judicial administration to set costs, which is ultimately always controlled judicially.\nNeither should the opposition of many lawyers from many countries to the quota litis pact be questioned. This pact violates the dignity of work and shows a lack of consideration and respect for the profession. The prohibition of the quota litis pact has also been accepted by the national courts, Mrs\u00a0Kroes.\nI would call upon the European Commission to respect the work of institutions which, like the colleges of lawyers and notaries, have generally speaking been working well for more than two centuries, despite the ups and downs and interruptions of history. Do not forget that constitutions, such as the Spanish Constitution, recognise the essential role of professional associations and the fundamental work they do.\nThe European Commission should be loyal to the European tradition, and not to the newer United States tradition. We must support small legal practices. Do not make any mistakes.\n(The President cut off the speaker)", "lang": "ES", "original": "Antonio Masip Hidalgo, en nombre del Grupo del PSE . \u2013 (ES) Se\u00f1or Presidente, la pregunta de la Comisi\u00f3n de Asuntos Jur\u00eddicos es oportuna, pues han de considerarse de forma especial las relaciones de abogados y notarios, y de las profesiones jur\u00eddicas en general \u2014como ha dicho el se\u00f1or Lehne\u2014, con sus clientes.\nLa Comisi\u00f3n Europea no debe tratar estos casos como si fueran una simple relaci\u00f3n mercantil entre cliente y proveedor de servicios. La relaci\u00f3n entre abogado o notario y cliente afecta a la buena marcha de algo tan delicado para la democracia, como tambi\u00e9n ha dicho el se\u00f1or Lehne, como es la administraci\u00f3n de justicia.\nLa intervenci\u00f3n de los colegios de abogados en los diversos pa\u00edses es muy ben\u00e9fica para las relaciones, no solo corporativas, sino tambi\u00e9n de defensa del inter\u00e9s p\u00fablico. La jurisprudencia del Tribunal de Justicia de las Comunidades Europeas, que tanto espera la se\u00f1ora Kroes, reconoce hasta ahora el respeto a la normativa europea de sistemas que, como el espa\u00f1ol, tienen tarifas de honorarios meramente orientativas, no m\u00ednimas, que sirven a la administraci\u00f3n de justicia para fijar la condena en costas, en definitiva controlada siempre judicialmente.\nTampoco deber\u00eda cuestionarse la oposici\u00f3n de los abogados de muchos pa\u00edses al pacto de quota litis . Ese pacto va contra la dignidad del trabajo y es una falta de consideraci\u00f3n y respeto para la profesi\u00f3n. La prohibici\u00f3n del pacto quota litis ha sido aceptada tambi\u00e9n, se\u00f1ora Kroes, por los tribunales nacionales.\nPido a la Comisi\u00f3n Europea que respete el funcionamiento de instituciones que, como los colegios de abogados y de notarios, funcionan bien en l\u00edneas generales desde hace m\u00e1s de dos siglos, con los altibajos e interrupciones hist\u00f3ricas que hayan tenido lugar. No olvide que constituciones, como la espa\u00f1ola, reconocen el alto papel de los colegios y de sus altos fines.\nLa Comisi\u00f3n Europea deber\u00eda ser fiel a la tradici\u00f3n europea y no a la estadounidense, nueva.
