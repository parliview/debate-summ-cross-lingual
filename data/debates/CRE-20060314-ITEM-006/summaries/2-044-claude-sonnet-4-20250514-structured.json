{"speaker": "Guntars Krasts (UEN). \u2013", "english": "Guntars Krasts (UEN). \u2013 (LV) Mr\u00a0President, the Commission\u2019s proposal on restructuring and employment contains the conclusion that policies aimed at blocking change and freezing economic structures can only defer the problem and thereby exacerbate the negative effects. Various measures concerning restructuring that are mentioned in Parliament\u2019s report, however, unfortunately go in precisely this direction and could make it difficult for businesses to adapt to changes in the markets.\nThe report\u2019s analysis of the situation and conclusions conflict with the measures proposed. For example, the report mentions the slow growth of the European Union\u2019s economy, the low competitiveness of businesses and workforce mobility. Later in the report, however, it is suggested that restructuring should not be used to increase business profitability by reducing the numbers of workers. The report\u2019s proposal for a growth adjustment fund is yet another example of short-term thinking. The best way to preserve jobs is to create new jobs. The report ought also to emphasise this aspect. Thus, in the field of restructuring, policy ought first of all to be directed towards implementing those socio-economic models that are geared towards permanent change. The measures taken ought to foster the development of self-regulatory capacity in the Member States and the European Union as a whole. Only thus will it be possible to balance growth and high employment in the long-term too.", "lang": "LV", "original": "Guntars Krasts (UEN). \u2013 Prezident!
