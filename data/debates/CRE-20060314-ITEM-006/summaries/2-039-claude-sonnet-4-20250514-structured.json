An appropriate strategy should also be introduced to facilitate by all possible means the full, satisfactory integration of our human resources in order to combat unemployment and prevent a brain drain outside our borders.\nIn cases of inevitable restructuring, the EU also ought to provide all the support necessary to restrict dismissals and give fair protection to workers, with the help of the ad hoc funds that the rapporteur rightly called for.", "lang": "IT", "original": "Alessandro Battilocchio (NI). \u2013 Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, parlo a nome del nuovo PSI.

Va inoltre impostata una strategia atta a favorire con tutti i mezzi il pieno e soddisfacente inserimento delle nostre risorse umane per combattere la disoccupazione ed evitare la fuga dei cervelli migliori al di fuori dei nostri confini.\nNei casi di ristrutturazione inevitabile, l\u2019UE dovr\u00e0 inoltre garantire tutto il sostegno necessario per limitare i licenziamenti e tutelare lealmente i lavoratori, con l\u2019ausilio giustamente richiesto dal relatore, di fondi ad hoc .", "agenda_item": "Restructuring and employment (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060314-ITEM-006", "intervention_id": "2-039", "summary_english": "{\n  \"headline\": \"Middle Path Needed on Restructuring: Balance Market Freedom with Worker Protection Through EU Support and Incentives\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"The speaker identifies a key challenge facing Europe regarding restructuring and employment: choosing between unrestricted market liberalization following competition laws versus protecting workers from excessive liberalization risks.
