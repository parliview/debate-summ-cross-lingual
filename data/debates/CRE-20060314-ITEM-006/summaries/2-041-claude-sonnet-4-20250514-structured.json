{"speaker": "Fran\u00e7oise Castex (PSE). \u2013", "english": "Fran\u00e7oise Castex (PSE). \u2013 (FR) Mr\u00a0President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, following the Hutchinson report, which we debated yesterday evening, the Cottigny report sets out the debate on the restructuring and relocation of businesses.\nI would like to thank the two rapporteurs for having raised these socio-economic problems, which create more anguish and social insecurity for our fellow citizens than almost anything else. It is fortunate that Parliament is debating these issues, because, Commissioner, the Commission must take steps as a matter of urgency. These issues set the European Union the challenge of the economic competitiveness of our companies and of job security for European employees. In the minds of European employees, relocation and restructuring are connected and practically synonymous, because they have the same effects: the same loss of their jobs after years of working in the same sector, sometimes even in the same company, and the same questioning of their value on the labour market. This need not be the case, because restructuring is sometimes a sign of progress, technical progress. Restructuring does not have the same economic causes as relocation, and the legislator needs to provide an appropriate solution to each problem.\nI would like to focus on the issue of restructuring of companies caused by technical developments, which is actually the central point in Mr\u00a0Cottigny's report. This issue sets the European Union the challenge of adapting to the increasingly rapid developments of our age of technical progress. It really sets us the challenge of anticipating those developments. It has been said that to govern means to foresee. Equally, to do business, to be at the leading edge of production and economic competition, also means to foresee. It is a matter not of adapting to progress but of anticipating it, of inventing it. In this respect, the responsibility rests solely with the companies \u2013 they must produce and they must help their employees to anticipate by providing them with continuing training. That is the issue raised by the Cottigny report, and I would ask you, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, to support these proposals.", "lang": "FR", "original": "Fran\u00e7oise Castex (PSE). - Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, Monsieur le Commissaire, chers coll\u00e8gues, apr\u00e8s le rapport Hutchinson, dont nous avons d\u00e9battu hier soir, le rapport Cottigny pose le d\u00e9bat des restructurations et des d\u00e9localisations d\u2019entreprises.\nJe voudrais remercier les deux rapporteurs d\u2019avoir pos\u00e9 ces probl\u00e8mes socio-\u00e9conomiques, qui sont parmi les plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rateurs d\u2019angoisse et d\u2019ins\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale pour nos concitoyens. Il est heureux que notre Parlement en d\u00e9batte: il est urgent, M. le Commissaire, que la Commission prenne des mesures. Ces questions posent \u00e0 l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne le d\u00e9fi de la comp\u00e9titivit\u00e9 \u00e9conomique de nos entreprises et le d\u00e9fi de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u2019emploi de nos salari\u00e9s. Dans l\u2019esprit des salari\u00e9s europ\u00e9ens, d\u00e9localisations et restructurations sont li\u00e9es et quasiment synonymes car ils en subissent les m\u00eames cons\u00e9quences: la perte de leur emploi apr\u00e8s des ann\u00e9es de travail dans le m\u00eame secteur d\u2019activit\u00e9, parfois m\u00eame dans la m\u00eame entreprise, la m\u00eame remise en cause de leur valeur professionnelle. Cela ne devrait pas \u00eatre, car les restructurations sont parfois le signe d\u2019un progr\u00e8s, d\u2019un progr\u00e8s technique. Les restructurations ne recouvrent pas les m\u00eame causes \u00e9conomiques que les d\u00e9localisations et il appartient au l\u00e9gislateur d\u2019apporter \u00e0 chaque probl\u00e8me sa solution adapt\u00e9e.\nJe voudrais insister ici sur la question des restructurations d\u2019entreprises pour des raisons de mutation technologique. C\u2019est en fait la question centrale du rapport Cottigny. Cette question pose \u00e0 l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne le d\u00e9fi de sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 s\u2019adapter aux mutations de plus en plus rapides de notre \u00e8re de progr\u00e8s techniques. Elle nous pose r\u00e9ellement le d\u00e9fi de les anticiper. On dit que gouverner, c\u2019est pr\u00e9voir! De m\u00eame, entreprendre, \u00eatre \u00e0 l\u2019avant-garde de la production et de la comp\u00e9tition \u00e9conomiques, c\u2019est aussi pr\u00e9voir. Il ne s\u2019agit pas de s\u2019adapter aux progr\u00e8s, il faut les anticiper, il faut les inventer. Dans ce domaine, la responsabilit\u00e9 des entreprises est enti\u00e8re, elles doivent produire et elles doivent aider leurs salari\u00e9s \u00e0 anticiper en veillant \u00e0 leur formation continue. C\u2019est la question du rapport Cottigny et je vous demande, chers coll\u00e8gues et M. le Commissaire, de soutenir ces propositions.", "agenda_item": "Restructuring and employment (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060314-ITEM-006", "intervention_id": "2-041", "summary_english": "{\n  \"headline\": \"Companies Must Anticipate Technical Progress and Provide Continuing Training to Address Restructuring Challenges\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"The speaker addresses the socio-economic problems of business restructuring and relocation, which create anxiety and social insecurity for European citizens.
