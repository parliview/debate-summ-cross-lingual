Our role is to take appropriate action to ensure that such changes are aimed at increasing competitiveness whilst minimising the social cost.\nAs we consider new legal solutions at European level, we ought not to focus exclusively on the need to improve financial results and profitability. Our main concern must always be the good of the citizens. They are the people who elected us to represent their interests and promote their well being. The resources we have available should be directed mainly at the weakest regions, and most of the latter are located in the latest Member States to join the Union.\nIn conclusion, and referring back to yesterday\u2019s debate on relocation in the context of regional development, I venture to point out that many people, including Members of this House, were quick to forget the hopes awakened in the new Member States in the course of the pre-accession campaigns. There is also a tendency to forget the commitments made to those States. We need to remember that those are the countries where the situation is particularly difficult and unemployment is at its highest.", "lang": "PL", "original": "Zdzis\u0142aw Zbigniew Podka\u0144ski, w imieniu grupy UEN . \u2013 Panie Przewodnicz\u0105cy!
