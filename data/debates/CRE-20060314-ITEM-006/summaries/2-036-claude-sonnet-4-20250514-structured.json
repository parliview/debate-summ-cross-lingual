{"speaker": "Ilda Figueiredo,", "english": "Ilda Figueiredo, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group . \u2013 (PT) This report addresses one of the main problems currently facing the EU, one which has serious ramifications in terms of unemployment, economic and social inequality and which hampers the development and even leads to the abandonment of vast areas.\nWe feel it is essential that company restructuring should only take place when it is for the purpose of saving jobs and helping the business to develop, and never simply in order to increase profits at the expense of redundancies or for purely financial or speculative reasons, as is happening with increasing frequency.\nWe therefore believe that a strong regulation is needed to combat such restructuring, which leads to investment without jobs and to thousands of redundancies. There also needs to be effective public monitoring of how Community aid is used and granted to businesses. The new regulations must ensure that the granting of aid is contingent on the protection of jobs with rights and on regional development in the medium term. Otherwise, business will be barred from receiving any aid.\nConsequently, we believe that the workers \u2013 through their representatives, namely the European Works Councils \u2013 should have the right to be involved at every stage of the process, which means having the right to vote, and therefore call for the directive on the European Works Councils to be reviewed.", "lang": "PT", "original": "Ilda Figueiredo, em nome do Grupo GUE/NGL . \u2013 Este relat\u00f3rio aborda um dos principais problemas que hoje se vive na Uni\u00e3o Europeia, com graves reflexos no agravamento do desemprego, das desigualdades econ\u00f3mico-sociais e da condena\u00e7\u00e3o de vastas regi\u00f5es ao abandono, bloqueando o seu desenvolvimento.\nConsideramos que \u00e9 essencial que as reestrutura\u00e7\u00f5es de empresas s\u00f3 ocorram quando for necess\u00e1rio salvar postos de trabalho e garantir o desenvolvimento das empresas e nunca apenas para aumentar os lucros \u00e0 custa de despedimentos ou por raz\u00f5es puramente financeiras e especulativas, como est\u00e1 a acontecer com cada vez maior frequ\u00eancia.\nPor isso insistimos na necessidade de uma firme regulamenta\u00e7\u00e3o contra tais reestrutura\u00e7\u00f5es, que d\u00e3o origem a investimentos sem emprego e s\u00e3o acompanhadas do despedimento de milhares de trabalhadores.
