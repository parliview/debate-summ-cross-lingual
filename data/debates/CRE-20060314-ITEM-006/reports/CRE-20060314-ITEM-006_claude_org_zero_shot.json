I met all of the social partners, employees and employers, I went to meet the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions and I had a meeting with Commissioner\u00a0\u0160pidla and the Commission's partners.\nWe also carried out a great deal of consultation with the shadow rapporteurs and I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mrs\u00a0Bachelot, Mrs\u00a0McDonald, Mrs\u00a0Schroedter and Mr\u00a0Beaupuy for their willingness to compromise and for the quality of their work.\nWhen we talk about restructuring, there is always a certain impression that people are surprised, and that it is a new phenomenon. In fact, it is as old as the hills and completely unavoidable. Society changes, moves on, modernises. It is quite normal for its economic activity to follow the same evolutionary curve.\nThe technical progress made by humans has been resulting in restructuring for centuries. I will give you an example that I am sure will not offend anybody here: in the transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture, our ancestors experienced a great deal of restructuring. Having said that, it is true that the acceleration of progress and today's global market have given these phenomena a new face.\nEach new decision we take may result in restructuring. That is why I would like, if I may, to congratulate the Commission on having recognised, in its communication, that, since the EU is sometimes the cause for restructuring, such as in the textiles sector, it needs to bear its share of the responsibility by supporting it to the best of its ability.\nAs you will have noticed, I have attempted throughout my report to stress the fact that restructuring is necessary, because in my view it ensures that our businesses remain economically competitive and thus safeguards jobs. However, in examining this issue, we cannot ignore restructuring based on false pretexts, which is in fact predicated on the hunt for an immediate profit. It is quite justifiable to condemn such behaviour as immoral, because it is absolutely unacceptable in today's Europe for a father with a family to support to find the factory gates locked on Monday morning, everything having been cleared out over the weekend.\nThe role of our institutions, and of the social partners, is to intervene as early as possible, so as to plan for restructuring better and to soften the blow in terms of the social cost. This is because restructuring, whether or not it is justified, often leaves people by the wayside.\nRestructuring is not a phenomenon that affects any Member State in particular. We must not heed the siren's call that tries to set us in opposition to each other whenever we discuss employment in this Chamber. There are not two blocks with the old Member States on one side and the new ones on the other. No, there are 450\u00a0million Europeans from Tallinn to Lisbon, any of whom could suddenly find themselves in this situation.\nIn my report, I have tried to define three spheres of action. First of all, there is a sphere of action to support what we might call good corporate citizens, by strengthening the tools for analysing the phenomenon, in order to prevent it in advance, increasing aid to small and medium-sized enterprises, encouraging continuing vocational training, which is a right for employees and an undeniable asset for businesses, reforming State aid to support growth and, in particular, setting up a globalisation adjustment fund.\nSecondly, there is a sphere of action to punish the 'gangster' companies, if I may call them that\u00a0\u2013\u00a0they are certainly very much in the minority, but they are the ones we talk about the most. This type of action involves better monitoring of the use of the European funds in order to prevent subsidy tourism, challenging certain instances of restructuring with doubtful motives, and respecting the Community legal acquis and its enforcement.\nThirdly, there is a sphere of action to support those primarily affected by the phenomenon of restructuring: the workers. This involves setting up permanent retraining units to help people to find new positions as soon as possible after losing their jobs. It involves strengthening the role of the social partners, who are our greatest asset in dealing with these phenomena, and that is why I would ask you all once again to consider reviewing the European Works Councils directive. It also involves encouraging employees to become shareholders in their companies and setting up a one-stop shop to give all EU citizens equal access to care.\nTo conclude, I think that, alongside the social partners and beyond any party political affiliations, we can help to provide support for restructuring in order to win the employment battle. We need to bear this in mind at a time when, from one minute to the next, it is possible for a decision taken by a board of directors on the other side of the world to completely destroy, here on our territory, the fruit of decades of work. This matter gives us the opportunity to get involved in the lives of our citizens, because that is what this is all about, behind all of our technical circumlocutions: men and women who just want to be happy. In the spirit of the founding fathers who created a Europe based on peace, it is up to us today to contribute to a Europe based on social peace.", "lang": "FR", "original": "Jean Louis Cottigny (PSE), rapporteur . - Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, Monsieur le Commissaire, chers coll\u00e8gues, je tenais avant toute chose \u00e0 remercier mes coll\u00e8gues, qui m\u2019ont fait confiance en me chargeant de ce rapport.\nPour pr\u00e9parer ce travail, l\u2019une des m\u00e9thodes que j\u2019ai employ\u00e9es a \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9coute.

This restructuring is taking on a whole new dimension with the emergence of new powers, resulting in a new aspect to work sharing, which will lead to Europe being forced to develop the service sector while giving up on being an agricultural and industrial power. We refuse to accept this prospect.\nIn this context, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats refuses to demonise necessary restructuring, but feels that the European market needs to promote a regulatory framework to absorb the shocks of this globalisation. The internal market is not the cause for restructuring\u00a0\u2013\u00a0it is the antidote to it.\nEven so, this European model is also a humanist model, and we need to take into consideration the suffering caused to the people and the territories affected by this phenomenon. The question that arises is this: how can we encourage socially responsible restructuring? Mr\u00a0Cottigny's report allows us to look at a number of approaches, to which our group contributed.\nAn initial approach involves reviewing the European Works Council directive and increasing the role of the social partners, following in-depth consultation with them: the rapporteur has proposed an amendment in this respect, which we support. Other approaches include access to expertise and the exchange of good practices, which is a relevant area for the open method of coordination; vocational training, with regard to which we are pleased that the support fund proposed by Mr\u00a0Barroso supports retraining for the workers affected and is not devoted to risky salvage operations; and optimising the support for our solidarity policies from the ESF/ERDF structural funds, on condition, Commissioner, that they are not compromised by the delayed financial perspective. I will, of course, conclude by mentioning research and innovation.\nI would like to end by thanking the rapporteur Mr\u00a0Cottigny for his open-mindedness, which made it possible to reach a number of compromises and which should, barring disasters, allow our group to vote in favour of his report.", "lang": "FR", "original": "Roselyne Bachelot-Narquin, au nom du groupe PPE-DE . - Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, mes chers coll\u00e8gues, les restructurations croisent deux mondes: celui de l\u2019\u00e9conomie, o\u00f9 elles sont n\u00e9cessaires pour affronter les mutations entra\u00een\u00e9es par la mondialisation et les exigences des consommateurs, et celui du social, o\u00f9 elles sont bien souvent source de souffrance et d\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 pour les salari\u00e9s.

The way he did this was excellent.\nI also share the rapporteur\u2019s view that restructuring is nothing new. If I look at my own home town, I note that the big workplaces that existed when I was a child are no longer there. Completely new workplaces have grown up. Society has changed as a result of this process, and workplaces are now of a higher quality than they were when I was growing up. That development will continue. What is new is that the process is happening so much more quickly in today\u2019s globalised world, which is why we must have restructuring as an instrument.\nIt may be seen as either a threat or an opportunity, but now that we have chosen a path to go down and said that we are not to compete with India and China with their low wages and their particular working conditions but, instead, retain a high level of wages and good social conditions, restructuring must be an instrument used in the Lisbon process. The issue is, however, one of how, then, we are to implement the restructuring.\nFirstly, we must have long-term planning. There are trends we need to be able to see. Moreover, we must act in time for, if we delay taking action, we may delay too long. Then, factories will simply have to close down. There will be no alternative. Our work to bring about change must take place in time.\nSecondly, there must be participation. Both sides of industry, including employees, must be involved in the whole process so that, when the restructuring process takes place in the form of skills updating and such like, people are prepared.\nThirdly, experiences must be shared. I visited the Dublin Institute last weekend. There has been extensive analysis of successful restructuring processes, and there is a bank of information about them. I know, for example, that, following last year\u2019s closure, 75% of former Electrolux employees in V\u00e4stervik have now already obtained new jobs. There has been cooperation between the company, both sides of industry and the local community with a view to creating new jobs.\nNow that we are creating a new Globalisation Fund, let us not forget the old instruments: the Social Fund and skills updating, together with responsibility taken at national and regional levels. I am a supporter of the Globalisation Fund if it is used to strengthen individuals and increase employment and does not preserve old structures.

I think the main reason for this is that the report we have before us sets out the problem well.\nSome of you, including the rapporteur himself, have pointed out that this is not a new problem\u00a0\u2013\u00a0it has existed for millennia. I would just like to emphasise that these issues of adaptation\u00a0\u2013\u00a0because restructuring is simply one aspect of the adaptation of businesses\u00a0\u2013\u00a0are absolutely vital in order to be able to respond to the needs of the customer, which includes every one of us here.\nI am not going to repeat the various points made by the rapporteur when he presented the subject. What I would like to say, because I think he sets a very good example, is that he has made some very pragmatic proposals, which I would divide into six categories. This has been emphasised by several people. The first point is the need to take action as early as possible. Also, I would remind my fellow Members, if they need reminding, that we do not hear anything about the vast majority of incidences of restructuring, precisely because the decision is taken in advance.\nSecondly, we need the partners to be involved \u2013 the partners in the business, obviously, but also the regional and external partners.\nMy final point, which has already been raised, is support for workers. Nevertheless, I would emphasise one very specific aspect, that of tailored support for employees, because general responses are not the only option. A tailored response really is needed. Each employee must be able to get an answer, through information, help looking for a new job, and so on.\nAs for the companies themselves, we must, as you said, make a distinction between the fraudulent businesses\u00a0\u2013\u00a0because there are some\u00a0\u2013\u00a0and the most essential businesses, which need to be supported. Finally, there is support for disadvantaged regions.\nMr Cottigny, I would like to thank you for the way you worked. As Mrs\u00a0Bachelot said on behalf of her group, I would say, on behalf of my group, that there is a good chance, a very good chance, that we will support you.\nIn conclusion, Commissioner, I obviously hope that the Commission will listen to Parliament's proposals, but I also hope that, beyond our European institutions, the various players \u2013 in the Member States, in the regions and in the chambers of commerce \u2013 and the various professional players will take note of the letter and the spirit of this report, so that restructuring is not a death sentence but rather an opportunity for these businesses and these workers to bounce back.", "lang": "FR", "original": "Jean Marie Beaupuy, au nom du groupe ALDE . - Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, mes chers coll\u00e8gues, je trouve que ce rapport est assez exemplaire, \u00e0 bien des \u00e9gards.

They are responsible for the continuing development of their skills, and this is where I agree with the rapporteur: workers are entitled to training, whether basic, advanced, or in-service. It is of course possible for vocational development and the training of professionals to be undertaken by publicly-funded bodies, but it would be outrageous for businesses to take the line that this was actually an obligation incumbent on the public sector, and that it had to take over responsibility for it.\nI concede that such restructuring or even relocations result in a great deal of unemployment in some regions, but I would remind those caught up in such situations of such instruments as the territorial pacts for employment that we \u2013 that is, this House together with the Commission \u2013 have put together. Studies testify to the fact that what made them really outstanding was that they involved all the local stakeholders. They are efficient; they were supported by European structural funds, and they were successful. It really does amaze me that the Commission is more reticent about its support for these territorial employment pacts and no longer has recourse to these options in the way it once did.\nLet me just say something about the Globalisation Adjustment Fund. Our group, too, is in favour of such a fund, but participation in it must be restricted to those enterprises that actually do take upon themselves the social responsibility for ongoing training and development rather than passing it on to somebody else. That is the only way of preventing this fund being a merely token gesture. It is for that reason that the involvement of the public sector must be conditional on participation by all the stakeholders, including the enterprises, in social planning.", "lang": "DE", "original": "Elisabeth Schroedter, im Namen der Verts/ALE-Fraktion . \u2013 Herr Pr\u00e4sident!

It is fortunate that Parliament is debating these issues, because, Commissioner, the Commission must take steps as a matter of urgency. These issues set the European Union the challenge of the economic competitiveness of our companies and of job security for European employees. In the minds of European employees, relocation and restructuring are connected and practically synonymous, because they have the same effects: the same loss of their jobs after years of working in the same sector, sometimes even in the same company, and the same questioning of their value on the labour market. This need not be the case, because restructuring is sometimes a sign of progress, technical progress. Restructuring does not have the same economic causes as relocation, and the legislator needs to provide an appropriate solution to each problem.\nI would like to focus on the issue of restructuring of companies caused by technical developments, which is actually the central point in Mr\u00a0Cottigny's report. This issue sets the European Union the challenge of adapting to the increasingly rapid developments of our age of technical progress. It really sets us the challenge of anticipating those developments. It has been said that to govern means to foresee. Equally, to do business, to be at the leading edge of production and economic competition, also means to foresee. It is a matter not of adapting to progress but of anticipating it, of inventing it. In this respect, the responsibility rests solely with the companies \u2013 they must produce and they must help their employees to anticipate by providing them with continuing training. That is the issue raised by the Cottigny report, and I would ask you, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, to support these proposals.", "lang": "FR", "original": "Fran\u00e7oise Castex (PSE). - Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, Monsieur le Commissaire, chers coll\u00e8gues, apr\u00e8s le rapport Hutchinson, dont nous avons d\u00e9battu hier soir, le rapport Cottigny pose le d\u00e9bat des restructurations et des d\u00e9localisations d\u2019entreprises.\nJe voudrais remercier les deux rapporteurs d\u2019avoir pos\u00e9 ces probl\u00e8mes socio-\u00e9conomiques, qui sont parmi les plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rateurs d\u2019angoisse et d\u2019ins\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale pour nos concitoyens.

I do, however, doubt that the report\u2019s underlying goal \u2013 that of lessening the social impact of restructuring \u2013 is actually capable of being achieved.\nFirstly, the European Union sets enhanced competitiveness in global markets as the goal of economic activity and hence also of restructuring, and that amounts to nothing other than an attempt to seek out and find the weak areas outside the EU, to which the losers can be transported.\nSecondly, if society really is to be able to alleviate the consequences of restructuring, the funds for those who lose out to globalisation would have to be so substantial that they would themselves reduce competitiveness. If, then, we in the EU are not to export our problems, we should say \u2018yes\u2019 to restructuring, but ask ourselves how it should work. What is needed is another way of managing things economically, another way in which society\u2019s goods can be produced, that really is founded upon social and global sustainability.

Various measures concerning restructuring that are mentioned in Parliament\u2019s report, however, unfortunately go in precisely this direction and could make it difficult for businesses to adapt to changes in the markets.\nThe report\u2019s analysis of the situation and conclusions conflict with the measures proposed. For example, the report mentions the slow growth of the European Union\u2019s economy, the low competitiveness of businesses and workforce mobility. Later in the report, however, it is suggested that restructuring should not be used to increase business profitability by reducing the numbers of workers. The report\u2019s proposal for a growth adjustment fund is yet another example of short-term thinking. The best way to preserve jobs is to create new jobs. The report ought also to emphasise this aspect. Thus, in the field of restructuring, policy ought first of all to be directed towards implementing those socio-economic models that are geared towards permanent change. The measures taken ought to foster the development of self-regulatory capacity in the Member States and the European Union as a whole. Only thus will it be possible to balance growth and high employment in the long-term too.", "lang": "LV", "original": "Guntars Krasts (UEN). \u2013 Prezident!

This is the way things are and entrepreneurs therefore need to implement modern management. A key feature of the latter is the ability to react in a flexible manner to changing market conditions, particularly with regard to new competitive challenges. Given the circumstances, it is not possible to manage enterprises effectively without ongoing cost analysis and a readiness to undertake necessary restructuring. It is important to keep in mind that the consequences of shying away from appropriate restructuring are always painful for both the entrepreneurs and the workers. We should keep this constantly in mind as we debate Mr\u00a0Cottigny\u2019s report on restructuring and employment.\nI am sure the quality of the document is much improved as a result of the work by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. Nevertheless, I am bound to say that in my opinion the text is still controversial, because it adopts an overly distrustful stance towards entrepreneurs restructuring their business or planning to do so. As a Member representing one of the countries that recently joined the European Union, I am particularly concerned about the proposals to impose penalties on companies transferring all or part of their activities to those parts of the Union where the production costs are lower. Entrepreneurs taking decisions of this nature are certainly not resorting to \u2018immoral or predatory tactics\u2019 \u2013 I quote from the document before us. In my view, precisely the opposite is the case. They are demonstrating sound management skills and taking responsibility for the company\u2019s future. They are therefore acting to promote the development of the Union\u2019s economy and increase its competitiveness. I would remind you that this is one of the fundamental aims of the Lisbon Strategy, so dear to all our hearts\nIntroducing elements of central planning into the European economy is not the right way to respond to the social consequences of restructuring either. This has already been proved unsuccessful and not just in post-Communist states. The only appropriate response is to improve qualifications, promote lifelong learning amongst the workers and encourage worker mobility. I should like to send out a further appeal in that regard and call for the transitional arrangements for access to labour markets to be lifted at the earliest opportunity.", "lang": "PL", "original": "Jacek Protasiewicz (PPE-DE). \u2013 Panie Przewodnicz\u0105cy!

The Social-Democrats, among whom I number myself, take the view that it is unnecessary to pump funds from the Netherlands to Brussels and back and that that is not the answer.\nWhilst it follows that not everyone in my country is pleased with the proposed European globalisation fund, I should nevertheless like to express my support for it, and would wish to add that I think that we should draw on existing ESF structures as much as we can. Why am I, all things considered, in favour of it? It is because citizens need support in order to deal with the adverse effects of globalisation.

Debate Information\n\n**Date:** March 14, 2006  \n**Topic:** Restructuring and employment (debate on report A6-0031/2006)  \n**Number of Contributions:** 18 speakers plus procedural interventions  \n**Rapporteur:** Jean Louis Cottigny (PSE) on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs  \n\n## 2. Executive Summary\n\n### Central Issue and Consensus\n\nThe debate centered on how to manage corporate restructuring in a globalized economy while protecting workers and maintaining European competitiveness. There was broad consensus that restructuring is inevitable and necessary for economic adaptation, but sharp disagreement on how to manage its social consequences.\n\n### Rapporteur's Framework\n\nJean Louis Cottigny presented a comprehensive three-pronged approach distinguishing between legitimate and illegitimate restructuring. He emphasized that \"restructuring is necessary, because in my view it ensures that our businesses remain economically competitive and thus safeguards jobs\" [Cottigny, 2006-03-14], while condemning restructuring based on \"false pretexts\" for immediate profit. His proposal included supporting \"good corporate citizens,\" punishing \"gangster companies,\" and protecting affected workers through permanent retraining units and strengthened social dialogue.\n\n### Commission Position\n\nCommissioner Vladim\u00edr \u0160pidla supported the report's balanced approach, stating that \"restructuring is essential, as it will allow the economy to develop, shedding the less productive activities and becoming stronger in key areas\" [\u0160pidla, 2006-03-14]. The Commission proposed concrete measures including a European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, tighter regulations on company relocations (extending guarantee periods from five to seven years), and enhanced use of Structural Funds for worker retraining.\n\n### Political Group Positions\n\n**Center-Right Perspective (PPE-DE):** Roselyne Bachelot-Narquin argued that \"the internal market is not the cause for restructuring \u2013 it is the antidote to it\" [Bachelot-Narquin, 2006-03-14]. The group supported regulated restructuring but opposed demonizing necessary business changes. However, Philip Bushill-Matthews sharply criticized the report, arguing it needed \"restructuring\" itself and was \"more concerned with trying to preserve the past than with helping employers and employees come to terms with the future\" [Bushill-Matthews, 2006-03-14].\n\n**Social Democrats (PSE):** Jan Andersson emphasized proactive management, stating that \"restructuring must be an instrument in the Lisbon process\" [Andersson, 2006-03-14]. He outlined three principles: forward planning, participation of all stakeholders, and sharing successful experiences. Fran\u00e7oise Castex stressed the need for companies to anticipate rather than merely adapt to technological progress.\n\n**Liberals (ALDE):** Jean Marie Beaupuy praised the report's pragmatic approach, supporting early intervention and individualized worker support. He emphasized that \"restructuring is not a death sentence but rather an opportunity for these businesses and these workers to bounce back\" [Beaupuy, 2006-03-14].\n\n**Greens (Verts/ALE):** Elisabeth Schroedter argued that \"restructuring and modernisation are things that enterprises are constantly obliged to do; indeed, they are a matter of social duty\" [Schroedter, 2006-03-14]. She opposed companies shifting training responsibilities to the public sector and supported conditional access to the Globalisation Fund.\n\n**Left (GUE/NGL):** Ilda Figueiredo demanded strict regulation, arguing that restructuring should only occur \"when it is for the purpose of saving jobs and helping the business to develop, and never simply in order to increase profits at the expense of redundancies\" [Figueiredo, 2006-03-14]. Gabriele Zimmer fundamentally questioned the EU's competitiveness-focused approach, calling for \"another way of managing things economically\" based on \"social and global sustainability\" [Zimmer, 2006-03-14].\n\n### Regional Perspectives\n\nRepresentatives from new Member States presented nuanced views. Zdzis\u0142aw Podka\u0144ski (UEN) emphasized directing resources to \"the weakest regions\" in new Member States, while Jacek Protasiewicz (PPE-DE) defended business relocations to lower-cost regions as \"sound management skills\" rather than \"immoral or predatory tactics\" [Protasiewicz, 2006-03-14].\n\nDerek Roland Clark (IND/DEM) presented a contrasting local success story from Northampton, arguing for national and local solutions over EU intervention: \"We did it by ourselves, by making our town attractive to the service sector\" [Clark, 2006-03-14].\n\n### Key Disagreements\n\nThe debate revealed fundamental tensions between market flexibility and worker protection. Conservative voices favored business autonomy and market-led solutions, while social democrats and left-wing parties demanded stronger regulation and public intervention. The proposed Globalisation Fund attracted both support as a solidarity mechanism and criticism as either insufficient or market-distorting.\n\n### Practical Proposals\n\nKey actionable proposals included: establishing a European Globalisation Adjustment Fund; extending guarantee periods for structural fund recovery; strengthening European Works Councils; creating permanent retraining units; implementing territorial employment pacts; and developing one-stop shops for restructuring support.\n\nThe debate demonstrated broad agreement on restructuring's inevitability but significant disagreement on the appropriate balance between market forces and social protection, with the ultimate vote scheduled for March 15, 2006.", "src_model": "claude", "model_type": "claude", "model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "structured": false, "incremental": false, "hierarchical": false, "grouped": false, "shuffle": false, "prompt": false, "lang": "original"}
