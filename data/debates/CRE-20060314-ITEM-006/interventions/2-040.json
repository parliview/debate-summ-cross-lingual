{"speaker": "Philip Bushill-Matthews (PPE-DE). \u2013", "english": "Philip Bushill-Matthews (PPE-DE). \u2013 Mr President, I agree with the Commissioner when he said on opening this debate that restructuring is necessary so that activity which is no longer sufficiently productive can be cut back. The issue is how restructuring should be managed and who should do the managing. Again I agree with the Commissioner that this should be for the companies themselves, for the employers, and the workers directly involved.\nThis report was originally due to be voted on in the February part-session, but the major political groups quite reasonably agreed to delay this for a month, to give time to try to improve it. This extra time has certainly been necessary. Progress has been made in terms of some of the amendments now tabled. Indeed, my colleague Mrs Bachelot-Narquin has been very active in this regard and I thank her for that. But we should not only be adopting the positive amendments, we really should be deleting some of the original paragraphs entirely. Until we do, this report will primarily be about resisting change and promoting the power of the trade unions to deal with it. It should be about enabling change and promoting the power of the workers to cope with it.\nIt will be clear to the rapporteur that I still do not like his report. It needs not just improvement, it needs \u2013 may I say \u2013 restructuring. As he knows, I was one of those who voted against his report in committee, in part to help us table further amendments for this part-session, but I should say now that my fellow UK Conservatives, as well as certain other national delegations that I know of, reserve the right to vote against it in the plenary sitting tomorrow. Although it is a non-legislative report, it would be a pity to vote down a report on such an important subject. But it would still be better to vote it down than to give the wrong message that this Parliament is more concerned with trying to preserve the past than with helping employers and employees come to terms with the future.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Philip Bushill-Matthews (PPE-DE). \u2013 Mr President, I agree with the Commissioner when he said on opening this debate that restructuring is necessary so that activity which is no longer sufficiently productive can be cut back.
