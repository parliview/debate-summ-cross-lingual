The phrase is very emphatic, but it actually seems that the European Union, and this is a euphemism, is placing too much emphasis on the effectiveness of trade in the fight against poverty.\nThe report under debate today is incomplete, and in the draft, in fact, there were some points where the effects of liberalisation on the economies of developing countries were called into question. Various econometric studies, a report by Christian Aid and the study entitled \u2018Winners and losers\u2019 by Sandra Polanski, published last week, have shown that many developing countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, would be experiencing better conditions today if we had not introduced unbridled liberalisation measures.\nThe Polanski study, which analyses the winners and losers in the liberalisations launched under the Doha Round, confirms data previously published by UNCTAD and the UNDP and reaches certain conclusions: developing countries will probably be the losers in the game, since they do not have the agricultural or industrial capacity to compete with the rich countries; the winners will in fact be the rich countries: the United States, Europe and Japan, and also China.\nFree trade will produce modest gains at the global level, partly because the adjustment costs which countries have to deal with when they undertake the liberalisation process promoted by the industrialised countries can be greater than the benefits.\nIt is not a question of being against trade, since the opening up of the markets can also be an effective instrument in the fight against poverty, but like any instrument it must be used with great caution. First of all, it is necessary to put the countries in a position to meet their own internal requirements, by boosting productive capacity in line, above all, with internal goals of self-sufficiency in food, and then it is necessary to allow them to tackle competition and limitations on supply, by providing adequate resources which are currently not present in the financial perspectives.\nSecondly, it is then necessary to work on the basis of realistic timetables, which take into account the time that structural adjustments require and, thirdly, it is necessary to restrict the opening up of the market, and to lay down, in addition, mechanisms for suspending the liberalisation process, if necessary, and to give the ACP countries the opportunity to protect their own incipient and strategic industries; in any case, we used this criterion ourselves throughout the last century and some in fact are still trying to put it forward again today.\nThese principles are almost present in the report, partly because these are the requests of the ACP countries, and it is those countries that are putting them forward. Because an effective principle of partnership requires that we take into account the requests of our partners, above all if they are justified, and above all if they are backed by civil society in Europe and in the ACP countries. Also and above all because the economic partnership agreements arise from the legal and institutional framework of the Cotonou agreement, signed by the European Union \u2013 and I underline this \u2013 and they have development and combating poverty as their ultimate goals.\nOn the basis of this same principle of partnership, we do not have the right to impose agreements. I believe that it is those countries that have to do it, and one of the main points in the report is the call for the Commission to carry out an immediate study of the alternatives so that the ACP countries can evaluate the options and decide whether to sign the agreements or not. The reciprocity that is being called for in the implementation of liberalisations, then, means applying equal laws to those who are not equal in economic or development terms; this is no way to produce equality or democracy.\nThinking about development solely in terms of increasing a country\u2019s gross domestic product is very reductionist. Development is hard to define, but when in my report the Commission is called upon to protect the sectors of water, health and education from liberalisation, what we are fundamentally talking about is rights that must be guaranteed, as when the Cape Town Declaration is quoted. The ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly also has the power to set development indicators in order to assess the achievement of results and trade agreements, requesting that social and environmental indicators be included such as the creation of dignified work, health, education and gender equality.\nWe are talking about rights \u2013 the same rights for which we have struggled in Europe, the same rights on which the European Union is founded. The European Parliament cannot wish to remove these values. We are at a crucial point in the struggle against poverty and we must meet the objectives that we have set ourselves.", "lang": "IT", "original": "Luisa Morgantini (GUE/NGL), relatrice . \u2013 Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, \u201cMangerai quando sarai competitivo\u201d \u00e8 lo slogan di un poster: sullo sfondo un ragazzo africano pelle e ossa. La frase \u00e8 enfatica, ma sembra proprio che l\u2019Unione europea stia, e questo \u00e8 un eufemismo, sopravvalutando l\u2019efficacia del commercio nella lotta alla povert\u00e0.\nLa relazione oggi in discussione \u00e8 monca, il progetto prevedeva infatti alcuni punti in cui si mettevano in discussione gli effetti della liberalizzazione sull\u2019economia dei paese in via di sviluppo. Diversi studi econometrici, un rapporto di Christian Aid , lo studio Winners and losers di Sandra Polanski, pubblicato la settimana scorsa, hanno mostrato che molti paesi in via di sviluppo, soprattutto nell\u2019Africa subsahariana, vivrebbero migliori condizioni oggi se non avessimo introdotto misure di liberalizzazione selvaggia.\nLo studio della Polanski, che analizza i vincenti e i perdenti delle liberalizzazioni lanciate con il ciclo di Doha, conferma dati che erano gi\u00e0 stati diffusi dall\u2019UNCTAD e dall\u2019UNDP ed arrivano ad alcune conclusioni: i paesi in via di sviluppo saranno verosimilmente i perdenti del gioco, visto che non hanno capacit\u00e0 agricole e industriali per competere con i paesi ricchi; i vincenti saranno proprio i paesi ricchi: gli Stati Uniti, l\u2019Europa e il Giappone, ma anche la Cina.\nIl libero commercio produrr\u00e0 modesti guadagni a livello globale, anche perch\u00e9 i costi di aggiustamento, che i paesi devono affrontare quando si impegnano nel processo di liberalizzazione promosso dai paesi industrializzati, possono essere maggiori dei benefici.\nNon si tratta di essere contro il commercio, l\u2019apertura dei mercati pu\u00f2 essere anche un efficace strumento di lotta alla povert\u00e0, ma come ogni strumento deve essere usato con molta cautela. Bisogna, prima di tutto, mettere in condizione i paesi di fare fronte alle proprie esigenze interne, rafforzando la capacit\u00e0 produttiva in funzione, soprattutto, di obiettivi interni di sovranit\u00e0 alimentare, poi bisogna permettere di far fronte alla concorrenza e alle limitazioni all\u2019atto dell\u2019offerta, fornendo risorse adeguate non presenti al momento nelle prospettive finanziare.\nBisogna, poi, in secondo luogo, lavorare sulla base di calendari realistici, che tengano conto del tempo che gli aggiustamenti strutturali chiedono e, in terzo luogo, bisogna limitare l\u2019apertura del mercato, prevedendo anche meccanismi per sospendere il processo di liberalizzazione, se necessario, e dando la possibilit\u00e0 ai paesi ACP di proteggere le proprie industrie nascenti e strategiche; del resto questo criterio lo abbiamo utilizzato noi stessi durante tutto lo scorso secolo e qualcuno in realt\u00e0 tenta ancora di riproporlo oggi.\nQuesti principi sono quasi presenti nella relazione, anche perch\u00e9 queste sono le richieste dei paesi ACP, sono loro che le formulano. Perch\u00e9 un principio effettivo di partnership impone di tener conto delle richieste dei nostri interlocutori, soprattutto se giustificate, soprattutto se sostenute dalla societ\u00e0 civile in Europa e nei paesi ACP. Anche e soprattutto perch\u00e9 gli accordi di partenariato economico nascono dal quadro legale e istituzionale dell\u2019accordo di Cotonou, firmato dall\u2019Unione europea \u2013 lo sottolineo \u2013 e hanno come obiettivo ultimo lo sviluppo e la lotta alla povert\u00e0.\nIn base a questo stesso principio di partenariato non abbiamo diritto di imporre accordi. Credo che siano loro a doverlo fare e uno dei punti principali della relazione \u00e8 la richiesta alla Commissione di studiare fin da subito le alternative affinch\u00e9 i paesi ACP possano, valutando le opzioni, scegliere se firmare o meno tali accordi. La reciprocit\u00e0, poi, con cui si sta richiedendo l\u2019attuazione delle liberalizzazioni, significa applicare leggi uguali tra soggetti non uguali economicamente e per grado di sviluppo; ci\u00f2 non porta affatto uguaglianza e democrazia.\nPensare allo sviluppo solo in termini di aumento del prodotto interno lordo in un paese \u00e8 molto riduttivo. Lo sviluppo \u00e8 difficile da definire, ma quando nella mia relazione si chiede alla Commissione di proteggere dalla liberalizzazione i settori dell\u2019acqua, della salute e dell\u2019istruzione, si parla sostanzialmente di diritti che devono essere garantiti, come quando si cita la dichiarazione di Citt\u00e0 del Capo, l\u2019Assemblea paritetica ACP-UE ha anche la competenza per fissare indicatori di sviluppo per valutare il conseguimento dei risultati e dei negoziati commerciali, chiedendo che si includano gli indicatori sociali e ambientali come la creazione di lavoro dignitoso, la salute, l\u2019istruzione, la parit\u00e0 dei sessi.\nSi parla di diritti, di quelli stessi diritti per i quali in Europa ci siamo battuti, di quelli stessi valori su cui si fonda l\u2019Unione europea. Il Parlamento europeo non pu\u00f2 voler cancellare questi valori. Siamo in un momento cruciale della lotta alla povert\u00e0, dobbiamo anche rispondere agli obiettivi che ci siamo posti.", "agenda_item": "The development impact of Economic Partnership Agreements (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060322-ITEM-016", "intervention_id": "3-200", "summary_english": "```json\n{\n  \"headline\": \"EU Must Reconsider Economic Partnership Agreements to Protect Developing Countries from Harmful Trade Liberalization\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"The speaker raises concerns about Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) and their potential negative impact on developing countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.

(FR) Mr President, Mrs Morgantini, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Commission, I should like to congratulate the Committee on Development, and in particular its Chairman, Mrs\u00a0Morgantini, for this report which makes development central to the negotiations on Economic Partnership Agreements, the EPAs. Development, we all agree, is indeed the starting point, the vital issue and the priority for our action. We shall, of course, continue to insist on that throughout the negotiations and during the implementation of the EPAs, when the time comes.\nFirstly, I am delighted that we share the same opinions on very many points, such as the importance of the dialogue with civil society and the national parliaments of the ACP countries, the objective of regional integration and economic governance, the role of investment and the diversification of exports. I find, in this report, opinions that I myself have often put forward to our partners, who have a vital role to play in this respect.\nThe prime objective is development, and that also involves a flexible approach that makes it possible to take into account the economic weaknesses of the countries concerned, which we are trying to strengthen. This approach manifests itself, for example, in the way in which trade liberalisation is biased in favour of the ACP countries, in flexibility in relation to the opening of their markets, in the extent to which we cover their products and in the necessary safeguard mechanisms. These are all principles that were clearly stated in our negotiating positions from the first day and that the Commissioner, Mr\u00a0Mandelson, has himself confirmed on several occasions.\nNonetheless, I have also observed that, on certain sensitive issues, the report raises doubts that I feel are not justified. For example, the report questions how coherent our position concerning the EPAs is with the commitments made in the Cotonou Agreement or in the recent declaration on the European Union\u2019s development policy. Perhaps there is a communication problem, which I shall try to resolve this very day. There should be no misunderstandings between us, because Parliament\u2019s support is obviously more necessary to the Commission than ever in the delicate phase of negotiations that we are in and that should come to an end in a little more than a year.\nFirst of all, I think that we need to put the compatibility of EPAs with the rules of the WTO back into the right perspective. Of course, this compatibility is imperative if we wish to ensure the stability of the EPAs, as of all our trade agreements, and the Commission must attend to this. We are also willing to improve on the WTO rules, if possible. Some proposals have been made along these lines, but I think we should have no illusions and that we must be aware of the objective limitations and difficulties of this approach. Above all, however, one must not forget that the real reason for the EPAs\u2019 existence is not the WTO but the urgent need, amply demonstrated and confirmed in the Cotonou Agreement, to make better use of trade as a driving force for economic growth in the ACP countries, as it has been for so many other countries, including developing countries.\nIn my opinion the success of the Economic Partnership Agreements will depend on three key factors, all of equal importance. Firstly, negotiations genuinely targeting the development of our partners, which is, as I have said, our only strategic objective. Secondly, the commitment of our ACP partners to establishing a statutory framework that favours investment. Thirdly, the support that the European Union, but also its Member States and other sponsors, will be able to offer to the countries concerned in order to prepare for, and bring about, the implementation of the EPAs. I understand the attention that our partners and Parliament are giving to this last point. From my very first day at the Commission, I promised to ensure that the necessary answers would be found.\nWe have succeeded \u2013 in obtaining the commitment of Member States to progressively doubling their aid for development, and I thank Parliament for its support without which this would not have been possible. May I remind you that that will represent an increase of more than EUR\u00a020 billion per year from 2010? We have succeeded in reaching an agreement on strengthening the cooperation between the Commission and the Member States within the framework of the European consensus adopted in December and confirming the priority to be given to the effectiveness of aid. We decided to focus first on Africa and we developed a coherent strategy for Africa. A trust fund for infrastructures, including those that facilitate trade, is already in place. In the context of the programme for the tenth European Development Fund (EDF), we are deciding with our partners on the best means of supporting regional economic integration, for which our partners have themselves drawn up agendas.\nThe Economic Partnership Agreements are part of this action and represent an important part of it. From this point of view, the timescale is essential. For example, loss of tax revenues resulting from the dismantling of customs tariffs will arise once the EPAs have come into force. This will be offset partly by the expected economic growth and partly by the rationalisation of taxation systems, which has already been initiated in several countries, often with our support. Furthermore, in order to make the transition easier, macroeconomic support measures are already envisaged for certain regions. I can tell you that I am actively working on devising measures to support the Economic Partnership Agreements, particularly in terms of the consequences there could be, initially, in terms of the resources necessary for the operation of the sovereign State.\nI know that there are some who would be in favour of a debate on the possible alternatives to the EPAs. Personally, I do not think that an academic debate of this kind would be useful. Firstly, an in-depth debate already took place when it was agreed, at Cotonou, that EPAs would offer the greatest benefits in terms of development, of market access compatible with the WTO and of support for good governance and regional integration. Secondly, all the ACP countries are continuing to negotiate EPAs. Finally, countries benefit from the effects of having access to markets forming part of the system of generalised preferences and of the \u2018everything but arms\u2019 initiative. We know, in the meantime, after virtually half a century of unilateral preference under the Lom\u00e9 Convention and the Cotonou Agreement, that this preferential access to our market is not in itself enough to meet the needs of our partners.\nIn conclusion, the report conveys our common position on a wide range of subjects. In order to set so many countries on the road to development and growth, I am ready to continue working with you on the objectives and challenges that we and our partners face in this complex, ambitious and vital project constituted by the EPAs.\nTomorrow, I have a seminar on East Africa. You know that I am doing the rounds of all the regional organisations and that, on each visit, I hear anxieties expressed by all those involved in development. You have conveyed these anxieties perfectly and, believe me, I am acutely aware of them. I am acutely aware of the very real questions that you are raising and I can tell you openly that investigations and discussions are making good progress, and creative thinking too, in order to develop a range of ways to give better support to the partner countries and to respond more directly to their concerns.\nIn conclusion, then, I thank you. I completely agree with the essential features of this excellent report and I remain more than ever open to the idea of a debate with you, particularly about the best ways to give support to this process.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Louis Michel, Member of the Commission.

In the context of the programme for the tenth European Development Fund (EDF), we are deciding with our partners on the best means of supporting regional economic integration, for which our partners have themselves drawn up agendas.\nThe Economic Partnership Agreements are part of this action and represent an important part of it. From this point of view, the timescale is essential. For example, loss of tax revenues resulting from the dismantling of customs tariffs will arise once the EPAs have come into force. This will be offset partly by the expected economic growth and partly by the rationalisation of taxation systems, which has already been initiated in several countries, often with our support. Furthermore, in order to make the transition easier, macroeconomic support measures are already envisaged for certain regions. I can tell you that I am actively working on devising measures to support the Economic Partnership Agreements, particularly in terms of the consequences there could be, initially, in terms of the resources necessary for the operation of the sovereign State.\nI know that there are some who would be in favour of a debate on the possible alternatives to the EPAs. Personally, I do not think that an academic debate of this kind would be useful. Firstly, an in-depth debate already took place when it was agreed, at Cotonou, that EPAs would offer the greatest benefits in terms of development, of market access compatible with the WTO and of support for good governance and regional integration. Secondly, all the ACP countries are continuing to negotiate EPAs. Finally, countries benefit from the effects of having access to markets forming part of the system of generalised preferences and of the \u2018everything but arms\u2019 initiative. We know, in the meantime, after virtually half a century of unilateral preference under the Lom\u00e9 Convention and the Cotonou Agreement, that this preferential access to our market is not in itself enough to meet the needs of our partners.\nIn conclusion, the report conveys our common position on a wide range of subjects. In order to set so many countries on the road to development and growth, I am ready to continue working with you on the objectives and challenges that we and our partners face in this complex, ambitious and vital project constituted by the EPAs.\nTomorrow, I have a seminar on East Africa. You know that I am doing the rounds of all the regional organisations and that, on each visit, I hear anxieties expressed by all those involved in development. You have conveyed these anxieties perfectly and, believe me, I am acutely aware of them. I am acutely aware of the very real questions that you are raising and I can tell you openly that investigations and discussions are making good progress, and creative thinking too, in order to develop a range of ways to give better support to the partner countries and to respond more directly to their concerns.\nIn conclusion, then, I thank you. I completely agree with the essential features of this excellent report and I remain more than ever open to the idea of a debate with you, particularly about the best ways to give support to this process.", "agenda_item": "The development impact of Economic Partnership Agreements (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060322-ITEM-016", "intervention_id": "3-201", "summary_english": "```json\n{\n  \"headline\": \"Commission defends EPAs as development-focused while acknowledging concerns about implementation and support\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"The speaker addresses concerns about Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs), including questions about their compatibility with WTO rules, coherence with EU development commitments, potential loss of tax revenues from tariff dismantling, and the need for adequate support during implementation.

The user provided a debate summary about Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) between the EU and ACP countries, and they want me to focus on Louis Michel's contributions. The task is to extract his main points, positions, arguments, and proposals from the debate summary.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided debate summary and find all mentions of Louis Michel. The summary mentions that he is the EU Commissioner who provided responses. The relevant section is under \"Commissioner's Response.\" \n\nIn that section, Louis Michel defends EPAs, stating that development is the starting point and priority. He mentions that the EU shouldn't impose diktats. His argument is that after the Lom\u00e9 and Cotonou agreements, preferential access isn't enough. So his position is in favor of EPAs but with the emphasis that development is key. \n\nNow, I need to structure this into the four categories: issueSum, positionSum, argSum, propSum. \n\nFor issueSum, the key issue here is the development impact of EPAs. Michel's response is about balancing development and trade, ensuring the EU doesn't impose terms. \n\nPositionSum: He supports EPAs but with development as the priority. He acknowledges concerns but argues that the EU's approach is necessary. \n\nArgSum: His argument is that the EU's previous preferential access hasn't been sufficient, so EPAs are needed. He also mentions that development must be the priority, not just trade.\n\nPropSum: The summary doesn't mention specific proposals from Michel, just his defense and acknowledgment of concerns. So maybe propSum is empty. \n\nWait, the user said if there are no points, return an empty string. So I need to check if Michel proposed anything. The summary says he \"defended EPAs while acknowledging concerns\" and stated the EU shouldn't impose diktats. But there's no specific proposal listed here. The key proposals mentioned earlier are from other speakers, not Michel. So propSum would be an empty string. \n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nissueSum: The development impact of EPAs and the need for the EU to not impose terms.\npositionSum: Supports EPAs with development as the priority, acknowledges concerns but argues for their necessity.\nargSum: Based on the need for EPAs after previous agreements didn't suffice and emphasizing development over trade.\npropSum: None, so empty.\n\nI need to make sure I don't include other speakers' points. The user specified to only include what's attributed to Louis Michel.

The present arrangements are, however, no longer consonant with the rules agreed within the WTO, in that the special treatment enjoyed by the ACP countries in comparison with other developing countries contravenes WTO rules and must therefore be brought into line with them.\nThe present system may continue to apply until 2008, and must have been adapted by then at the latest.\nThere are those in the House who reject EPA\u2019s from the outset; they do not believe that a certain measure of trade liberalisation, in whatever form, can make any contribution to the development of poor countries.\nMy group, though, is convinced that trade can indeed play a part, certainly that the liberalisation of trade among the ACP countries can do so. We have no objection in principle to EPAs, provided that they are arrived at on the basis of sound agreements, providing for such things as adequate time for the countries in question to adapt to the new circumstances, and support for them in doing so. It is important that EPAs should make provision for that.\nSo, as far as we are concerned, let there be EPAs, if they stand a chance of helping to fight poverty. The Group of the European People\u2019s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats wants them to retain the development goal as a top priority, which means that liberalisation must only be gradual, for the benefit of the ACP countries and adapted to their specific and varied circumstances, with important basic services such as water, education, transport and energy remaining available to all. The PPE wants a realistic timetable, in other words enough time for necessary changes to be made. The PPE-DE Group wants sufficient support measures (for example technical assistance, capacity-building and reforms in such areas as customs and taxation) and it wants to see cooperation on a regional basis promoted between the ACP countries.\nThere are four areas about which the PPE-DE Group has concerns, and they are as follows.\nThe first is the limited supply of information from the Commission on the course of the negotiations. Then there is the pressure of time under which these are now being conducted and under which they will also have to be implemented. The negotiations have been in progress since 2002 and still no draft texts have been made available to us.\nFinally, there are the financial aspects. The EPAs\u2019 success will depend on a decent sum of money being made available. In the first place, this will have to come from the European Development Fund and then from other sources as well. It is not yet sufficiently clear where the money will come from then. There are emergency rules that make provision for this, and they are necessary. If the system appears not to be working in some places, the process must be capable of being slowed down or stopped for a period of time. Scope for that already exists under current WTO rules. We have as yet no specific proposals to make about this. The Commissioner has already gone some way deeper into this issue, and I look forward with pleasure to closer cooperation and more detailed information.", "lang": "NL", "original": "Maria Martens, namens de PPE-DE-Fractie . - Voorzitter, commissaris, de economische partnerschapsovereenkomsten hebben betrekking op de handelsrelaties met de ACS-landen. Deze zijn geregeld door de Overeenkomst van Cotonou. De huidige afspraken zijn evenwel niet meer in overeenstemming met de regels die in het kader van de WTO zijn afgesproken, doordat de bijzondere behandeling die de ACS-landen in vergelijking met andere ontwikkelingslanden genieten, in strijd is met de WTO-regels en hieraan dus moet worden aangepast.\nDe overgangstermijn voor het huidige systeem geldt tot 2008. Uiterlijk dan moet de aanpassing een feit zijn.\nSommigen hier in het Parlement wijzen EPO's per definitie af. Zij geloven niet dat een zekere mate van liberalisering van de handel een bijdrage aan de ontwikkeling in arme landen kan leveren, ongeacht de vorm.\nVoorzitter, mijn fractie is ervan overtuigd dat handel daaraan w\u00e9l een bijdrage k\u00e1n leveren, zeker de liberalisering van de handel tussen de ACS-landen onderling. Bij ons bestaat geen principieel bezwaar tegen EPO's, mits goede afspraken worden gemaakt. Daarbij hoort bijvoorbeeld voldoende tijd en steun voor de landen om zich aan de nieuwe situatie aan te passen. Het is belangrijk dat de EPO's daarin ook voorzien.\nVoorzitter, wat ons betreft, mogen de EPO's er dus komen vanwege hun mogelijke bijdrage aan de armoedebestrijding. De EVP wil dat de ontwikkelingsdoelstelling bij de EPO's voorop blijft staan. Dus liberalisering slechts geleidelijk, ten voordele van de ACS-landen en aangepast aan de specifieke situatie van de verschillende landen, waarbij belangrijke basisvoorzieningen zoals water, onderwijs, transport en energie beschikbaar moeten blijven voor iedereen. De EVP wil een realistisch tijdpad, dus genoeg tijd om noodzakelijke veranderingen door te voeren. De PPE-DE-Fractie wil voldoende ondersteunende maatregelen (denk aan technische assistentie, capaciteitsopbouw en hervormingen in bijvoorbeeld douane en belastingen) en zij wil ook de regionale samenwerking tussen de ACS-landen bevorderen.\nDe EVP, Voorzitter, heeft evenwel ook zorgen, met name op de volgende vier punten.\nTen eerste de beperkte informatievoorziening door de Commissie over het verloop van de onderhandelingen. Daarnaast de tijdsdruk waaronder de onderhandelingen inmiddels verlopen en die straks dus ook voor de implementatie zal gelden. Voorts lopen de onderhandelingen al sinds 2002 en hebben we nog steeds geen conceptteksten.\nTot slot de financi\u00ebn. Om de EPO's te doen slagen zijn aanzienlijke bedragen nodig. In de eerste plaats zullen deze uit het Europees Ontwikkelingsfonds moeten komen en daarnaast ook uit additionele fondsen. We hebben nog onvoldoende helderheid over de vraag waar dit geld vandaan moet komen. Wat de noodmaatregelen betreft waarin is voorzien, die zijn ook nodig. Wanneer het systeem op plaatsen niet blijkt te werken, moet het proces vertraagd of tijdelijk gestopt kunnen worden. De ruimte hiervoor is er onder de huidige WTO-regels ook.

I wish to begin by referring to his remark that talking about alternatives to economic partnership agreements is \u2018academic\u2019 \u2013 that was the word he used. It is very clearly stated in the Cotonou Agreement that alternatives are part of what the ACP countries have an option on deciding to follow. Therefore, Commissioner, it is not an academic issue, but something that is very definitely an option for the ACP.\nThe economic partnership agreements are very complex and complicated for the ACP and are the most complex and complicated negotiations they have ever engaged in. I suspect that they also present the Commission with certain difficulties, if not only because of the tensions which naturally exist between DG Development\u2019s concerns and priorities and DG Trade\u2019s concerns and priorities, which are very different. We know from our own experience in this Parliament that there is not always that necessary coherence between our objectives.\nMy impression is that there are concerns that are common to all the regional negotiations and I am following them very closely. There are examples of the Commission wanting a framework that facilitates trade as a first priority. The ACP regions are far more interested in addressing supply side constraints and the link between EPAs and development support. Market access remains absolutely central as an issue.\nThe proposed opening of the economies of the ACP countries \u2013 most of which are least-developed countries \u2013 is a major concern. The benefits of regional integration, market access and integrated trade and development, as my colleague Mrs Martens said, are absolutely clear. However, what we understand in the Committee on Development is that any potential benefits could be outweighed by the potential costs which they might be expected to pay. Therefore, the agreements they might have to make on market access \u2013 market opening \u2013 may not be exactly what they need and perhaps they could get more from other kinds of arrangements.\nTo be competitive and to market their goods, there needs to be substantial investment in their ability to do so. ACP countries need training and their workforce needs to be improved; they need improved infrastructure, transport and institutional capacity-building. All these are major priorities for the ACP.\nIt must be said that it is not for the Commission to tell the ACP what a good EPA is. It is up to the ACP \u2013 in consultation with their parliaments, the Joint Parliamentary Assembly and civil society \u2013 to make that kind of decision. Any criteria we make on economic partnership agreements must be based on their relationship with the Millennium Development Goals.\nI should like to ask the Commissioner one question. The central Africa negotiations are portrayed as a model of these regional negotiations. My sources tell me that DG Development at its highest level \u2013 that probably means you, Commissioner \u2013 is very worried about the capacity of the secretariat of the Central African Economic and Monetary Community in their negotiations. Is it the case that you, Commissioner, have publicly called for the executive secretary and chief EPA negotiator in CAEMC to be dismissed? If that is the case, then how does this sit with DG Trade\u2019s description of this as being the absolute role model?\nFinally, I should like to draw attention to the Cape Town Declaration of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2002. Benchmarks were put in place there to assess the conduct and outcome of the negotiations on the basis of key social and environmental indicators, including decent work, health, education and gender.

However, what we understand in the Committee on Development is that any potential benefits could be outweighed by the potential costs which they might be expected to pay. Therefore, the agreements they might have to make on market access \u2013 market opening \u2013 may not be exactly what they need and perhaps they could get more from other kinds of arrangements.\nTo be competitive and to market their goods, there needs to be substantial investment in their ability to do so. ACP countries need training and their workforce needs to be improved; they need improved infrastructure, transport and institutional capacity-building. All these are major priorities for the ACP.\nIt must be said that it is not for the Commission to tell the ACP what a good EPA is. It is up to the ACP \u2013 in consultation with their parliaments, the Joint Parliamentary Assembly and civil society \u2013 to make that kind of decision. Any criteria we make on economic partnership agreements must be based on their relationship with the Millennium Development Goals.\nI should like to ask the Commissioner one question. The central Africa negotiations are portrayed as a model of these regional negotiations. My sources tell me that DG Development at its highest level \u2013 that probably means you, Commissioner \u2013 is very worried about the capacity of the secretariat of the Central African Economic and Monetary Community in their negotiations. Is it the case that you, Commissioner, have publicly called for the executive secretary and chief EPA negotiator in CAEMC to be dismissed? If that is the case, then how does this sit with DG Trade\u2019s description of this as being the absolute role model?\nFinally, I should like to draw attention to the Cape Town Declaration of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2002. Benchmarks were put in place there to assess the conduct and outcome of the negotiations on the basis of key social and environmental indicators, including decent work, health, education and gender. The potential for this was confirmed last year by the ACP Council.

The user provided a debate summary about Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) between the EU and ACP countries, and they want the main points from Glenys Kinnock's speech.\n\nFirst, I need to find where Glenys Kinnock is mentioned in the summary. Scanning through the sections, under \"Positions on EPA Framework\" and \"Development vs. Trade Priorities,\" there's a mention of Glenys Kinnock. The key quote is: \"it is not for the Commission to tell the ACP what a good EPA is. It is up to the ACP \u2013 in consultation with their parliaments, the Joint Parliamentary Assembly and civil society \u2013 to make that kind of decision.\" She advocates for ACP-led negotiations focusing on supply-side constraints before market opening.\n\nNow, structuring the JSON response. The user's example has four fields: issueSum, positionSum, argSum, propSum. \n\nFor \"issueSum,\" the main issue here is the negotiation process and decision-making authority. The speaker is concerned about who decides the EPA terms. \n\n\"positionSum\" should state her position: ACP countries should lead negotiations, involving their parliaments and civil society. \n\nThe argument here is that the Commission shouldn't dictate terms, emphasizing sovereignty and local decision-making. \n\n\"propSum\" would be her proposal for ACP-led negotiations with specific consultations. \n\nI need to make sure not to include other speakers' points. Check if there's anything else about her. The summary also mentions she emphasizes addressing supply-side constraints before market opening. So maybe include that in position or issue. \n\nWait, the user's example for \"positionSum\" is a summary of positions. So combining the two points: her position is that ACPs should lead negotiations, considering their own priorities, and focusing on supply-side issues first. \n\nSo, \"issueSum\" could be about the need for ACP-led negotiations and addressing supply-side constraints. But the user's example for issueSum is more about the topic, like protection of trade secrets. So maybe \"issueSum\" here is the negotiation authority and timing of market opening. \n\nBut the user's example has \"issueSum\" as the key issue. So in this case, the key issue is the role of the ACP in decision-making and the timing of market liberalization. \n\nBut the exact quote from the summary says she argues that the Commission shouldn't dictate, and that ACPs should decide based on their own needs. So the issue is about who has the authority in negotiations and the approach to market opening. \n\nTherefore, \"issueSum\" could be: \"The key issue raised by the speaker is the need for ACP countries to have sovereignty in determining the terms of EPAs, with a focus on addressing supply-side constraints before market liberalization.\"\n\n\"positionSum\": \"She advocates that ACP countries, not the EU Commission, should lead negotiations, emphasizing consultation with parliaments, the Joint Parliamentary Assembly, and civil society to prioritize supply-side development before market opening.\"\n\n\"argSum\": \"Her position is based on the principle that ACP countries should have control over their development paths, ensuring that market liberalization is preceded by strengthening domestic capacities.\"\n\n\"propSum\": \"She proposes ACP-led negotiations with extensive consultation and a focus on addressing supply-side constraints prior to market opening.\"\n\nWait, but the user's example for propSum is a specific proposal. The speaker's proposal here is that the ACPs should lead negotiations, which is a procedural proposal. So \"propSum\" would be \"advocates for ACP-led negotiations with consultation of parliaments, the Joint Parliamentary Assembly, and civil society, prioritizing supply-side development before market liberalization.\"\n\nBut need to check if the user's example has \"propSum\" as the proposals. Yes, in the example, propSum is \"He advocates for strict limitations on government demands for private data\". So in this case, the proposal is about ACP-led negotiations.\n\nSo putting it all together, ensuring each field is concise and only includes what the speaker said. Avoid any other contributions.

We expect the Commission to give clear priority to development and the elimination of poverty in the ACP countries in the negotiations. The criticism that I am about to make is clearly aimed at the appearance of a representative of DG Trade at a hearing of the Committee on Development. Let me be quite clear about this: we do not want negotiations that reflect the style and behaviour of a colonial power; we believe that the decision-making sovereignty of our partners in the ACP countries must be preserved.\nThis sovereignty should be encouraged by investment in trade infrastructure, and, of course, by means of support for national strategies to combat poverty, which is fully in line with the principle of subsidiarity so prized in the EU. If governments exercise their sovereignty by deciding to view the economic partnership agreements with scepticism, then there have to be alternatives such as those offered by the Cotonou Agreement. That is why I wonder why the Group of the European People\u2019s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats wishes to delete that reference. Why does the PPE-DE Group suddenly no longer feel bound by agreements? The PPE-DE Group is also seeking to delete virtually every sentence from the report that gives the ACP governments negotiating sovereignty and their own political room for manoeuvre as to whether liberalisation should be implemented in a given sector, to what extent and in what time frame. Why, I would like to know?\nThe Morgantini report calls for basic provision with drinking water, education and other key public services to be excluded from liberalisation from the outset. The PPE-DE Group wishes this to be deleted, and instead calls for the liberalisation of the water sector to be based on affordable prices. I regard that as pure cynicism.

This approach strengthens the report before us and supports its objectives to make Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) a workable means of implementing the EU\u2019s targets for development cooperation.\nWTO rules force us into separate Economic Partnership Agreements, because the trade relationship based on the Lom\u00e9 Conventions and Cotonou Agreement is non-reciprocal and therefore inconsistent with the WTO\u2019s enabling clause. Under this clause, industrial countries are permitted to give unilateral and non-reciprocal preferential treatment to just two categories of countries: either all Least Developed Countries or all developing countries. Since the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States (ACP) regions include countries from both groups, the original preferences granted to the ACP countries are incompatible with current WTO rules, and our transition period giving entitlement to waivers expires in 2008.\nIn order to make the EU-ACP trade relationship WTO-compliant in the long term, a solution has been sought in the EPAs. Under the proposed EPAs, the trade relationship between the EU and the different ACP regional groups will be reciprocal. Under Article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), countries at different levels of development can enter into a reciprocal free trade agreement provided that the liberalisation of essentially all trade occurs within a reasonable length of time. In the context of the EPAs, this has come to be understood as roughly 90% of trade within 10-12 years.\nIt is clear that implementing a reciprocal free trade agreement will be a major challenge for the ACP countries, whose level of development varies a good deal. Reciprocity represents a major shift in the EU\u2019s approach to development and trade policies with ACP partners.\nOn the other hand, we know that the support allowed by Lom\u00e9 and Cotonou did not halt the decline in ACP market share. Since we are worried about premature liberalisation, we need to ask whether in this context there is such a thing as timely liberalisation. Sometimes bold steps have to be taken, which means we must at the same time make sure that the eventual outcome of negotiations on agreements leaves sufficient time for ACP domestic and regional markets to adapt.\nI myself also think that it is important to allow everyone unobstructed access to nature\u2019s own \u2018free\u2019 services. Therefore, on World Water Day, I feel it is necessary to mention how essential it is, for example, that water resources are managed fairly.\nThe opening up of markets in some cases has also led to the spread of poverty in developing countries, and for that reason the progress of talks should be monitored carefully. The negotiations must be impartial, and no pressure should be put on any party while they are taking place.", "lang": "FI", "original": "Eija-Riitta Korhola (PPE-DE). \u2013 (FI) Arvoisa puhemies, aivan aluksi haluan kiitt\u00e4\u00e4 kollegaani Martensia hyv\u00e4st\u00e4 puheenvuorosta ja h\u00e4nen esitt\u00e4mist\u00e4\u00e4n tarkistuksista.

It advocates the necessity for Community solidarity in the face of regulation that carries the risk of uncontrolled liberalisation. This work was welcomed unanimously within the Committee on Development. It is my wish and hope that it will receive the same support in tomorrow\u2019s vote.\nOne essential principle must guide our thinking: development in accordance with, and closely linked to, the Cotonou Agreement. It is a prime objective in all the negotiations and within the framework of the implementation of EPAs with the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries.\nI understand the need to bring trade relations between the European Union and the ACP countries into line with the WTO rules; I am talking about unilateral preferential access between Community markets. Nonetheless, compatibility with the WTO rules must not take precedence over our international commitments to promoting sustainable development and eradicating poverty.\nI share the fears of our ACP partners and of many NGOs with regard to the way in which negotiations are now conducted by the Commission and with regard to the logic underlying these negotiations. There is, indeed, a glaring asymmetry between the two parties. If we do not attend to this, the swift and harmonious reciprocal opening of markets that is being sold to us will be fatally unbalanced and, I fear, will lead only to disillusionment.\nThis liberalisation of trade between unequal partners, far from promoting development as intended, runs the risk of having devastating effects on the fragile economies of the countries concerned and on their vulnerable populations. And this at the very moment when, in our speeches, we are claiming to want to help these countries to achieve the Millennium Development Goals which, as we already know, are out of reach.\nI believe that if these agreements are conceived gradually and in a concerted manner, within a rational and predictable framework, in order to promote trade and investment in this area, they will represent a real opportunity for the ACP countries, an opportunity both in terms of economic diversification and harmonious regional integration and in terms of real and successful integration within the world economy.\nA few priorities must be stated. The first of these is the exclusion of the Singapore issues and of essential public services, without neglecting the principle of the right of these countries to use safeguards to defend their sensitive strategic sectors. The second priority is to respect our commitment to seek out alternative trade systems to EPAs for those countries that request it, as is stipulated in Article 37.6 of the Cotonou Agreement. These alternatives must be based on the principle of non-reciprocity established in the generalised system of preferences (GSP) as well as on the introduction of a clause establishing special, differentiated treatment at the WTO. These priorities depend very much on the willingness of the European Union to give its full weight within the WTO to facilitating improvement in the rules in terms of development priorities.\nFinally, stating a wish is no use without the means to achieve it. I should like to conclude by saying that, beyond the concern about the European Union\u2019s financial perspectives, we must, on the one hand, keep the promises made by the President of the Commission at Gleneagles concerning aid for trade. On the other hand, we must envisage new financial commitments to compensate for the cost, to the ACP countries, of the removal of preferences and customs tariffs, strengthen technical support to ACP countries and, finally, ladies and gentlemen, reject the unacceptable reduction in the European Development Fund. Since, however, I am not convinced that these aims will be achieved quickly, I suggest that, where the reciprocal opening of markets is concerned, the Commission consider, as a token of its goodwill, prolonging the period of transition according to the specific needs of the ACP countries, as defined at the time of the negotiations.", "lang": "FR", "original": "Kader Arif (PSE). - Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, Monsieur le Commissaire, chers coll\u00e8gues, je tiens \u00e0 remercier ma coll\u00e8gue, Luisa\u00a0Morgantini, pour l\u2019excellent rapport qu\u2019elle nous soumet aujourd\u2019hui concernant l\u2019impact des accords de partenariat \u00e9conomique sur le d\u00e9veloppement.\nLa philosophie g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de ce texte est juste.

La premi\u00e8re d\u2019entre elles est l\u2019exclusion des sujets de Singapour et des services publics essentiels, sans n\u00e9gliger le principe du droit de ces pays de d\u00e9fendre leurs secteurs strat\u00e9giques sensibles par des mesures de sauvegarde. La deuxi\u00e8me priorit\u00e9 est de respecter notre engagement de rechercher des r\u00e9gimes commerciaux alternatifs aux APE pour les pays qui en feraient la demande, comme le stipule l\u2019article\u00a037, point\u00a06, de l\u2019Accord de Cotonou. Ces alternatives doivent \u00eatre bas\u00e9es sur le principe de non-r\u00e9ciprocit\u00e9 institu\u00e9 dans les SPG ainsi que sur l\u2019introduction d\u2019une clause instituant un traitement sp\u00e9cial et diff\u00e9renci\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019OMC. Ces priorit\u00e9s d\u00e9pendent fortement de la volont\u00e9 de l\u2019Union de peser de tout son poids, au sein de l\u2019OMC, pour favoriser l\u2019am\u00e9lioration des r\u00e8gles dans le sens des priorit\u00e9s du d\u00e9veloppement.\nEnfin, on ne peut exprimer une volont\u00e9 sans moyens. Je veux donc conclure en disant que, par-del\u00e0 l\u2019inqui\u00e9tude quant aux perspectives financi\u00e8res de l\u2019Union, il faudrait, d\u2019une part, tenir les promesses faites par le pr\u00e9sident de la Commission \u00e0 Gleneagles concernant l\u2019aide au commerce.

In terms of quality, I cannot add anything, but nevertheless I would like to say a few words about Luisa Morgantini\u2019s report.\nThe importance of development cooperation must not be underestimated. As welfare societies and European communities, we want to help fellow human beings who are worse off than ourselves, both in our own countries and elsewhere. In a way, this is a measure of how civilised we are.\nIt is true that today, in many Member States of the European Union, there is some debate about what proportion of financing should be channelled into development cooperation. For example, in Finland, where I come from, this issue has just been discussed, and I know that the 0.7% target recommended by the UN has not been achieved: we have kept at around the 0.4% mark. It is also to be hoped that the other European countries, Finland included, will make progress in this matter. Hopefully, we in the European Union will establish a common will, as well as the funding, to attend to the needs of our brothers and of nations worse off than us.\nIn my opinion, however, we should ensure that the aid we give is in harmony with the principles of sustainable development. Economic, social and environmental factors must always be taken into account in EU development cooperation. It is not merely money that is important, but, above all, partnership, aiding development and helping countries to get off to a good start.\nWe must also be careful to promote European values such as democracy and human rights through development cooperation.

(FR) Ladies and gentlemen, I agree with some of the points that have been made. As regards the apparent lack of information coming from the Commission, the Commission is, of course, willing to provide all the information it has available. Perhaps you feel that there is too little information. I shall see to it, for my own part in any case, that I give you all the information that I have.\nWith regard to the need to have large sums of money available, if extra money is needed, the Member States will have to provide it. You know very well the amounts available from the European Development Fund: I have only the money that is allocated to me.\nWith regard to Mrs Kinnock\u2019s speech, I should like there to be no misunderstanding. When I spoke about an \u2018academic\u2019 debate on the alternatives, this was not intended to be impertinent. In fact, it is possible to make alternative proposals to those who do not wish to negotiate, but, as matters stand at present, they are, as you well know, Mrs Kinnock, all negotiating. The word was perhaps ill chosen, but starting a debate on the alternatives when they are all already negotiating does not seem very useful to me.\nI should like to say to you that I am fairly broadly in agreement with the other comments you have made. Thus, I agree with your comments concerning access to the market, but you have to admit too that access to the market is not everything. Our experience of 50 years of liberalisation clearly shows that it is not enough and that there is a whole list of other factors to consider. You will find none more convinced than I of the fact that we must focus on the benefits of development. I am, therefore, completely in agreement with this principle.\nRegarding production problems, it is clear that production is one of the areas in which we can most usefully provide support to the countries in question. It is at this level that one can provide the necessary funding for technical or technological upgrading, for technology transfer, for product quality, in short to finance the added value so necessary for access to the market.\nI agree with you in recognising that the European Union must not impose diktats. That would not correspond at all either with my convictions or with the idea I have of development. There is a negotiation and, in a negotiation, each partner puts forward his arguments. There is no diktat in that. I am also in agreement with Mrs Martens when she says that the timescale must be realistic. I completely agree that it is necessary to safeguard access to water, to energy and to a whole range of essential goods. I share your views on this matter completely and I am extremely doubtful about the idea of liberalising these sectors.\nMrs Kinnock, on the question of the dismissal of the secretary that I am said to have called for, firstly, I do not have the power to dismiss the secretary concerned and, secondly, I have not called for anyone to be dismissed. What is true \u2013 because I am anxious to take full responsibility for what I have done \u2013 is that, in answer to an appeal from the secretary of CAEMC, the Central African Economic and Monetary Community, I simply said that I did not agree with granting a request for extra money for someone who has done nothing, and I can vouch for the fact that he has done nothing. I am, moreover, not the only person to complain about the fact. To justify himself, he said that he had no right of injunction in relation to Member States. The work that should have been done was not done. We do not receive the documents in proof that we ask for. There is a problem about transparency in his management. In these circumstances, I feel that it is part of my job to point out some of the basic principles of governance, especially when we are concerned with a request concerning funding from the Commission. I acknowledge, therefore, what I did, but I never called for the dismissal of anybody and, in any case, I do not have the power to do so.\nTo sum up, I shall say that the package, in the negotiation, must be comprehensive and coherent. Peter Mandelson negotiates the EPAs, and I have a supporting role. We work in tandem, therefore. My starting point is, of course, development and, more specifically, economic development as the driving force for growth. I would point out, moreover, that countries have agendas for the fight against poverty, which include this aspect. The regions covered by economic integration agendas are asking us to support them, which we are doing. This integration involves an aspect of commercial liberalisation between them; we support this, and the EPAs support this demand for regional integration.\nI can see that some of your fears are justified, but I can assure you, as far as I am concerned at least, that the development aspect will be a priority. It is on this aspect that the negotiations will focus, and the support measures will have to make possible, according to the pace that these countries are capable of maintaining, an upgrading that should give them, in the long run, much easier access not only to regional integrated markets but also to the world market.\nIn conclusion, I understand all your misgivings and anxieties. I am prepared \u2013 and I think that this is really very important \u2013 to have an exchange of views with you, including about all the supporting measures. I am looking for all the creativity of which you are capable and I am completely open on these questions, without any preconceptions.

The user provided a debate summary about Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) between the EU and ACP countries, and they want me to focus on Louis Michel's contributions. \n\nFirst, I need to read through the debate summary carefully. The user specified that I should only include points attributed to Louis Michel. Looking at the summary, there's a section titled \"Commissioner's Response\" where Louis Michel's statements are mentioned.\n\nThe key points from his response are: he defends EPAs, states that development is the priority, and mentions that the EU shouldn't impose diktats. He also argues that EPAs are necessary because the previous preferential access under Lom\u00e9 and Cotonou isn't enough. \n\nI need to structure the response into the four categories: issueSum, positionSum, argSum, propSum. \n\nFor issueSum, the main issue here is the necessity of EPAs despite concerns. PositionSum would be his defense of EPAs and emphasis on development. The argument is that after 50 years of unilateral preferences, EPAs are needed. Proposals might include his stance on not imposing diktats and the need for EPAs. \n\nWait, the user said to only include what's attributed to the speaker. The summary says he \"defended EPAs while acknowledging concerns\" and mentioned that development is the priority. His arguments are that EPAs are necessary because previous systems aren't sufficient. There's no specific proposal mentioned beyond his defense. The propSum might be his call for EPAs as necessary, but the summary doesn't list specific proposals from him, just his position. \n\nSo, I need to make sure not to include other speakers' points. The example response the user gave has specific sections. Let me check again. The user's example includes issue, position, argument, and proposal. \n\nIn this case, Louis Michel's issues are the effectiveness of EPAs versus previous agreements. His position is supporting EPAs but with development as the priority. The argument is based on the ineffectiveness of previous preferences. Proposals might be the need for EPAs, but the summary doesn't mention specific proposals from him, just his defense. So propSum might be empty or refer to his stance. \n\nBut the user's example has \"He advocates for strict limitations...\" so maybe in this case, the propSum would be his emphasis on development and not imposing diktats. However, the summary says he \"emphasized that the European Union must not impose diktats\" and that EPAs are necessary. So the proposals would be his points about not imposing and the necessity of EPAs. \n\nI need to structure this into the JSON fields without including other speakers. Make sure each section is concise and only includes his points.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The necessity of Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) amid concerns about their impact on developing economies and the transition from previous trade frameworks.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"Defended EPAs as necessary for development, emphasizing that the EU must not impose 'diktats' and that development remains the priority.\",\n\"argSum\": \"Argued that after half a century of unilateral preferences under the Lom\u00e9 and Cotonou agreements, EPAs are required to address the limitations of previous trade arrangements.\",\n\"propSum\": \"Stressed the importance of EPAs as a framework for trade while ensuring development remains central, though no specific policy proposals were detailed beyond this stance.\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "President.", "english": "President.
