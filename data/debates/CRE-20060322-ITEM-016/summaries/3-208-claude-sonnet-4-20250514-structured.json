{"speaker": "Alessandro Battilocchio (NI). \u2013", "english": "Alessandro Battilocchio (NI). \u2013 (IT) Mr\u00a0President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank Mrs\u00a0Morgantini, the rapporteur, for the excellent job she has done. In a society that is now dominated by a globalised economic market, the Community institutions have a duty to encourage development cooperation, in a world in which three billion human beings live on less than two dollars a day and over a billion survive on one dollar.\nFor this shared aim, we must search for suitable means which can lead both to an improvement in the economic situation of developing countries and to gradual and increasing integration into the world market. The European Union\u2019s cooperation policies must contain priorities designed to change the internal processes in those countries, promoting a stable, open and democratic political climate as well as an increase in prosperity . Within this context it can be said that the economic partnership agreements represent a suitable tool to boost and implement trade relations between the ACP and the European Union.\nWe should also emphasise another point: development investment in the so-called \u2018sensitive\u2019 sectors such as education, health and energy should be constantly monitored, and where necessary restrictions should be imposed on economic liberalisation. We ought always to remember that in order to be successful and have a positive impact on the social fabric of developing countries, effective integration and economic growth must necessarily be accompanied by an improvement in people\u2019s general living conditions. On this issue a precise, specific and consistent commitment is needed.", "lang": "IT", "original": "Alessandro Battilocchio (NI). \u2013 Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, ringrazio innanzitutto la relatrice Morgantini per l\u2019ottimo lavoro svolto. In una societ\u00e0 ormai dominata da un mercato economico globalizzato, l\u2019incentivazione della cooperazione allo sviluppo \u00e8 un dovere per le istituzioni comunitarie, in un contesto mondiale in cui tre miliardi di esseri umani vivono con meno di due dollari al giorno e oltre un miliardo sopravvive con un dollaro.\nPer questa finalit\u00e0 condivisa dobbiamo ricercare i mezzi adeguati che possono condurre sia ad un miglioramento della situazione economica nei paesi in via di sviluppo, sia ad una condizione di integrazione al mercato mondiale progressiva e crescente. Le politiche di cooperazione dell\u2019Unione devono racchiudere priorit\u00e0 finalizzate alla trasformazione dei processi interni a questi paesi, che promuovano un clima politico stabile, aperto e democratico nonch\u00e9 un incremento del welfare. In questo ambito si pu\u00f2 affermare che gli accordi di partenariato economico raffigurano un mezzo adeguato per rafforzare ed implementare le relazioni commerciali ACP-Unione europea.\nDobbiamo inoltre porre l\u2019accento su un altro punto: vanno monitorati costantemente gli investimenti per lo sviluppo nei settori cosiddetti sensibili, quali l\u2019istruzione, la salute e l\u2019energia, ricorrendo, se necessario, ad una limitazione delle liberalizzazioni economiche. Dobbiamo ricordarci sempre che un\u2019efficace integrazione e crescita economica, per avere successo e incidere positivamente sul tessuto sociale dei paesi in via di sviluppo, deve essere necessariamente accompagnata da un miglioramento delle condizioni di vita generali della popolazione.
