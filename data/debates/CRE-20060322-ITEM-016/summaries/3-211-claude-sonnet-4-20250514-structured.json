{"speaker": "Hannu Takkula (ALDE). \u2013", "english": "Hannu Takkula (ALDE). \u2013 (FI) Mr President, I hope that Economic Partnership Agreements will be a workable means of eliminating poverty, and that they will allow us to go from making declarations to something concrete. I warmly welcomed the speeches on this subject this evening, and that of Eija-Riitta Korhola in particular was excellent. In terms of quality, I cannot add anything, but nevertheless I would like to say a few words about Luisa Morgantini\u2019s report.\nThe importance of development cooperation must not be underestimated. As welfare societies and European communities, we want to help fellow human beings who are worse off than ourselves, both in our own countries and elsewhere. In a way, this is a measure of how civilised we are.\nIt is true that today, in many Member States of the European Union, there is some debate about what proportion of financing should be channelled into development cooperation. For example, in Finland, where I come from, this issue has just been discussed, and I know that the 0.7% target recommended by the UN has not been achieved: we have kept at around the 0.4% mark. It is also to be hoped that the other European countries, Finland included, will make progress in this matter. Hopefully, we in the European Union will establish a common will, as well as the funding, to attend to the needs of our brothers and of nations worse off than us.\nIn my opinion, however, we should ensure that the aid we give is in harmony with the principles of sustainable development. Economic, social and environmental factors must always be taken into account in EU development cooperation. It is not merely money that is important, but, above all, partnership, aiding development and helping countries to get off to a good start.\nWe must also be careful to promote European values such as democracy and human rights through development cooperation. It is important to take these into account in development cooperation.", "lang": "FI", "original": "Hannu Takkula (ALDE). \u2013 (FI) Arvoisa puhemies, toivon ett\u00e4 taloudelliset kumppanuussopimukset olisivat toimiva v\u00e4line, jolla k\u00f6yhyys voitaisiin poistaa ja ett\u00e4 p\u00e4\u00e4sisimme julistuksista konkretiaan.
