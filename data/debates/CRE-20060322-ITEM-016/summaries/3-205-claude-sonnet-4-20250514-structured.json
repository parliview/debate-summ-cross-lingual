{"speaker": "Margrete Auken,", "english": "Margrete Auken, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. \u2013 (DA) Mr\u00a0President, the purpose of the Cotonou Agreement and the Economic Partnership Agreements is to eradicate poverty and promote sustainable development. That objective must under no circumstances go by the board. The quid pro quo mentality or idea of reciprocity, based on a principle of equality, is therefore quite wrong. The fact is, we are concerned here with two quite unequal partners, the EU and the ACP countries, so it is not the ACP countries that should be helping the EU countries, but the other way around. That is something I am absolutely certain Mrs\u00a0Morgantini agrees with me about.\nPoor countries\u2019 only export opportunities are in the fields of agriculture and raw materials and in relation to very labour-intensive products, such as textiles, which they should be allowed to export to ourselves in the EU without restriction. The ACP countries also have extremely weak economies. We cannot therefore demand that these countries just go ahead and open up 90% of their markets in return for the EU opening up its own markets as a kind of payment. That is a view also expressed in Mrs\u00a0Morgantini\u2019s report. I hope, then, that I am right in interpreting paragraph\u00a017 of the report as saying that it is of course only the ACP countries that are entitled to introduce temporary import restrictions in relation to industries threatened by surges in imports. It would be very unfortunate if we were entitled to prevent the ACP countries from selling us textiles and agricultural products just because we had not been skilful enough to adapt to the changed conditions of competition in a globalised world. The fact is that we too were allowed to protect our own markets when our economies were still developing. That being said, protecting markets is a very uncertain way of achieving growth and a healthy economy, and it should therefore be a limited, including time-limited, measure for developing countries too.", "lang": "DA", "original": "Margrete Auken, for Verts/ALE-Gruppen . - Hr. formand Form\u00e5let med Cotonou-aftalen og de \u00f8konomiske partnerskabsaftaler er at udrydde fattigdom samt fremme b\u00e6redygtig udvikling. Det form\u00e5l m\u00e5 under ingen omst\u00e6ndigheder g\u00e5 tabt. Derfor er noget-for-noget-tankegangen, alts\u00e5 forestillingen om en gensidighed, der bygger p\u00e5 et lighedsprincip, helt sk\u00e6vt. Vi har jo at g\u00f8re med to helt ulige partnere, EU og AVS, og det er alts\u00e5 ikke AVS, der skal hj\u00e6lpe EU-landene, men omvendt. Det er jeg stensikker p\u00e5, at Luisa Morgantini er enig med mig i.\nDe fattige landes eneste mulighed for eksport har vi inden for landbrug, r\u00e5varer og s\u00e5 meget arbejdsintensive produkter, som eksempelvis tekstiler, som de uden begr\u00e6nsninger b\u00f8r have lov til at eksportere til os i EU. AVS-landene har samtidig ekstremt skr\u00f8belige \u00f8konomier. Derfor kan vi ikke forlange, at disse lande uden videre \u00e5bner op for 90 % af deres markeder som geng\u00e6ld for, at EU \u00e5bner sine markeder som en slags betaling. Og det synspunkt fremg\u00e5r ogs\u00e5 af Luisa Morgantinis bet\u00e6nkning. Jeg h\u00e5ber alts\u00e5, jeg har ret, n\u00e5r jeg tolker punkt 17 i bet\u00e6nkningen s\u00e5dan, at tilladelsen til at indf\u00f8re midlertidige importbegr\u00e6nsning p\u00e5 industrier, der trues af voldsomme importstigninger, selvf\u00f8lgelig kun g\u00e6lder for AVS-landene. Det skulle n\u00f8dig v\u00e6re s\u00e5dan, at vi har ret til at stoppe deres muligheder for at s\u00e6lge os tekstiler og landbrugsvarer, bare fordi vi ikke har v\u00e6ret dygtige nok til at tilpasse os de \u00e6ndrede konkurrencevilk\u00e5r i en globaliseret verden. Vi fik jo ogs\u00e5 lov til at beskytte vores markeder, da vores \u00f8konomier var under udvikling. Men under alle omst\u00e6ndigheder er markedsbeskyttelse en meget usikker vej til v\u00e6kst og sund \u00f8konomi, og derfor b\u00f8r det v\u00e6re en begr\u00e6nset og tidsbegr\u00e6nset aff\u00e6re ogs\u00e5 for ulandene.", "agenda_item": "The development impact of Economic Partnership Agreements (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060322-ITEM-016", "intervention_id": "3-205", "summary_english": "{\n\"headline\": \"EU-ACP Partnership Agreements Must Prioritize Poverty Eradication Over Reciprocal Market Access\",\n\"issueSum\": \"The speaker addresses the fundamental imbalance between the EU and ACP countries in Economic Partnership Agreements, highlighting that ACP countries have weak economies with limited export opportunities mainly in agriculture, raw materials, and labor-intensive products like textiles.
