It is not the means that are crucial, but the ends. It is quite possible that negotiations with Turkey will produce an outcome other than full membership, and here comes a key sentence: \u2018We will no longer go along with the progressive softening-up of the accession criteria,\u2019 say the German Social Democrats, and we German Free Democrats agree with them one hundred per cent.\nAssimilation capacity is also defined; here, the main problem is that the European Union\u2019s capacity to assimilate the new members is in part dependent on the agreement in principle of the people in the Member States.
