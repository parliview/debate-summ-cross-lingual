Until now, the Neighbourhood Policy has not been sufficient as an instrument. This has been proved by the fact that during its implementation, the countries influenced by its scope experienced periods of crisis and destabilisation on a large scale.\nNew forms of cooperation as proposed in the report cannot, however, close the door to membership. We have to be aware today that either we offer countries on our eastern borders the prospect of membership or our appeals for democracy, market economy and respect for human rights will remain empty words. Unless they are offered at least the prospect of membership in the distant future, these countries will return to the sphere of Russian influence and all that this entails with regard to democracy and human rights.\nHowever, in the very same report we see the development and strengthening of views on enlargement in terms of absorption capacity. This term was never clearly defined and today is nothing more than a clever-sounding excuse, a cheap explanation for backing out of the enlargement process. If absorption capacity is to be based on acceptance of the Constitutional Treaty, then one could have the impression that the authors of this text definitely want to close the door to everyone. The Treaty, in the version we know today, can never resurface.\nDemanding that the European Commission defines the borders of the Union is a mistake. It will only bring embarrassing political discussions on the subject of geography and will definitely weaken the influence the Union has on the processes of democratisation, stabilisation and the strengthening of pro-western policy in neighbouring countries.
