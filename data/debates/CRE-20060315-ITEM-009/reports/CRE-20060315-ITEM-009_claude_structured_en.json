This is an important point, and one of which we must not lose sight either now or in the future.\nIt also has to be clear to us, though, that stability is an achievable goal only if the European Union is strong enough to develop the ability to master these tasks; that, for example, was why the Constitutional Treaty was a retrospective attempt at really making the addition of ten new Member States workable in institutional terms and in terms of the objectives involved, and the reason why we are in such difficulties now is that the ratification process is going nowhere.\nWe also have to realise that the European Union's capacity for accepting new members is one of the essential aspects of the Copenhagen criteria, although there are good reasons why that has been purely declaratory in nature. When we reach the sort of interface that we will reach after Bulgaria and Romania we will, however, have to bring this into play and redefine it. It is for that reason that we ask the Commission, by the end of the year, to define what is meant by the European Union\u2019s absorption capacity with reference to this and this will enable us to make use of it. What makes that so extraordinarily important is that this is not just a constitutional issue but also touches on issues of the European Union\u2019s financial capacities and much more besides.\nI also think that we have to make it clear to just what extent the European Union is capable of accepting new members, and that this can affect the \u2018yes or no?\u2019 decision at the end of the day. The prospect of EU membership is to be held out not only to countries that have already commenced accession negotiations, that have candidate status or to whom one has been promised post-Thessaloniki \u2013 which promise, let me point out for the avoidance of former doubts and in order to re-clarify matters, cannot be withdrawn \u2013 but also as an incentive to highly-important internal reforms and to such states as Ukraine, European states that are currently subject to dictatorships and need to have such a perspective if they are to be kept looking westwards.\nFor that, the Neighbourhood Policy alone is not enough. In some instances, the countries themselves or the European Union itself are currently finding it too much to combine this with the prospect of full membership, for it can in many cases be realised only in fifteen years\u2019 time. If this project is to be credible, something between the two is needed, something with which these countries can have the prospect of full membership held out to them, without us being put under unrealistic pressure to give it to them at once.\nThis should be open to every state that is not currently a Member State of the European Union. I would like again to emphasise that this can be the final stretch in countries such as Norway \u2013 which is also a party to the Schengen convention \u2013 so decide on the basis of their participation in the European Economic Area. If I may be permitted to talk in terms of a \u2018European Economic Area plus\u2019, then there is much that can be done with such a multilateral project in the fields of the internal market, internal and external security, environmental policy and much else besides.\nIt can also be an intermediate stage, though. If states that, today, have the prospect of accession held out to them post-Thessaloniki \u2013 such as for example the countries of the Western Balkans, whose development is expected to take different periods of time \u2013 should decide to use it as an interim stage to full membership, then what was promised at Thessaloniki would not be made void. It is on this basis that we can achieve a new degree of flexibility by making this prospect credible, for things can happen at once without the intervening fifteen years of negotiations, and then we will have to say \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019.\nSo, yes, I do see that enlargement, in some countries, entails plebiscites, and so we have no idea whether ratification will eventually happen. What that means is that this is not just an attempt at an \u2018everything or nothing\u2019 strategy, but also at creating ways in which these countries might be given credible perspectives, while at the same time saving and driving forward the political project that is the European Union.\n(Applause)", "lang": "DE", "original": "Elmar Brok (PPE-DE), Berichterstatter . \u2013 Herr Pr\u00e4sident, Herr Kommissar, Frau Ratspr\u00e4sidentin! Die Erweiterung der Europ\u00e4ischen Union war bis zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt der erfolgreichste Teil ihrer Au\u00dfenpolitik. Denn dies war ein Instrument, die Zone der Stabilit\u00e4t und des Friedens in Europa und auch der Bereiche von Frieden, Freiheit, Menschenrechten und Rechtsstaatlichkeit weiter voranzubringen. Dies ist ein wichtiger Punkt, den wir uns heute und k\u00fcnftig vor Augen halten m\u00fcssen.\nDabei m\u00fcssen wir allerdings auch sehen, dass das Ziel der Stabilit\u00e4t nur erreichbar ist, wenn die Europ\u00e4ische Union in sich die St\u00e4rke hat, sich so zu entwickeln, dass sie den Aufgaben, die damit verbunden sind, gerecht werden kann. Deswegen wurde ja beispielsweise mit dem Verfassungsvertrag im Nachhinein versucht, die Erweiterung um zehn Mitgliedsl\u00e4nder institutionell und von den Zielsetzungen her wirklich m\u00f6glich zu machen. Und hier sind wir in einer schwierigen Situation, weil der Ratifikationsprozess nicht vorankommt.\nWir m\u00fcssen auch sehen, dass in den Kopenhagener Kriterien die Aufnahmef\u00e4higkeit der Europ\u00e4ischen Union einer der wesentlichen Punkte ist, bisher aus guten Gr\u00fcnden aber nur deklamatorischen Charakter gehabt hat. An einer solchen Schnittstelle \u2013 nach Bulgarien und Rum\u00e4nien \u2013 m\u00fcssen wir diesen Punkt allerdings operationell machen und neu definieren. Deswegen bitten wir die Kommission, bis Ende des Jahres die Aufnahmef\u00e4higkeit der Europ\u00e4ischen Union in einem solchen Zusammenhang zu definieren, damit wir dies als Instrument einsetzen k\u00f6nnen. Das ist au\u00dferordentlich wichtig, da es nicht nur um eine Verfassungsfrage geht, sondern auch um Fragen, die mit den finanziellen F\u00e4higkeiten der Europ\u00e4ischen Union und manchem mehr zu tun haben.\nDar\u00fcber hinaus meine ich, dass wir die Aufnahmekapazit\u00e4t der Europ\u00e4ischen Union so deutlich machen m\u00fcssen, dass dies auch ein Punkt des Ja oder Nein am Ende des Tages bedeuten kann. Die europ\u00e4ische Perspektive ist nicht nur f\u00fcr L\u00e4nder, die bereits Beitrittsverhandlungen haben, die einen Kandidatenstatus haben oder denen nach Thessaloniki eine Beitrittsperspektive versprochen worden ist \u2013 ein Versprechen, das \u00fcbrigens nicht zur\u00fcckgenommen werden soll, um das hier noch einmal ganz deutlich zu machen und vorherige Missverst\u00e4ndnisse zu beseitigen\u00a0\u2013, als Anreiz f\u00fcr innere Reformen von gro\u00dfer Bedeutung, sondern auch f\u00fcr andere Staaten wie die Ukraine, Staaten, die heute in Europa noch unter Diktaturen stehen und auch eine solche Perspektive haben m\u00fcssen, damit der Blick nach Westen gesichert ist.\nDaf\u00fcr ist die Nachbarschaftspolitik allein nicht ausreichend. In manchen F\u00e4llen sind die L\u00e4nder oder die Europ\u00e4ische Union zum heutigen Zeitpunkt \u00fcberfordert, dies allein mit der Perspektive der Vollmitgliedschaft in Zusammenhang zu bringen, weil die in vielen F\u00e4llen erst in f\u00fcnfzehn Jahren realisiert werden kann. Wir brauchen zur Glaubw\u00fcrdigkeit dieses Projekts etwas, das dazwischen liegt, mit dem wir diesen L\u00e4ndern eine Perspektive geben k\u00f6nnen, ohne uns unter den nicht erf\u00fcllbaren Druck der sofortigen Vollmitgliedschaft zu setzen.\nDies sollte allen Staaten, die heute nicht Mitglied der Europ\u00e4ischen Union sind, offen stehen. Ich m\u00f6chte ausdr\u00fccklich noch einmal wiederholen: Das kann das Endstadium sein, wenn L\u00e4nder wie beispielsweise Norwegen, das auch Mitglied von Schengen ist, im Rahmen des Europ\u00e4ischen Wirtschaftsraumes es so entscheiden. Man kann in den Bereichen Binnenmarkt, innere und \u00e4u\u00dfere Sicherheit, Umweltschutzpolitik und mehr in einem solchen multilateralen Projekt \u2013 wenn ich den Arbeitstitel \u201eEurop\u00e4ischer Wirtschaftsraum plus\u201c einmal benutzen darf \u2013 vieles machen.\nEs kann aber auch eine Zwischenstation sein. Wenn Staaten, die heute nach Thessaloniki eine Beitrittsperspektive haben \u2013 wie beispielsweise die L\u00e4nder des Westbalkans mit unterschiedlichen Entwicklungsperspektiven, was die zeitlichen Erwartungen betrifft\u00a0\u2013, sich entscheiden sollten, zu sagen, wir benutzen das als Zwischenschritt zu einer Vollmitgliedschaft, wird das Versprechen von Thessaloniki nicht au\u00dfer Kraft gesetzt. Auf dieser Grundlage k\u00f6nnen wir ein neues Ma\u00df an Flexibilit\u00e4t zustande bringen, indem wir diese Perspektive mit Glaubw\u00fcrdigkeit erf\u00fcllen, weil unmittelbar etwas geschehen kann und nicht f\u00fcnfzehn Jahre verhandelt wird und dann ein Ja oder Nein im Raum steht.\nIch sehe doch, dass in manchen L\u00e4ndern mit der Erweiterung auch Volksabstimmungen verbunden sind und wir gar nicht wissen, ob die Ratifikation am Ende gelingt. Das hei\u00dft, es ist auch ein Versuch, nicht nur eine Alles-oder-Nichts-Strategie zu betreiben, sondern M\u00f6glichkeiten zu schaffen, diesen L\u00e4ndern glaubw\u00fcrdige Perspektiven zu geben und gleichzeitig die Europ\u00e4ische Union als politisches Projekt zu retten und voranzubringen.\n(Beifall)", "agenda_item": "2005 enlargement strategy paper (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060315-ITEM-009", "intervention_id": "3-230", "summary_english": "```json\n{\n  \"headline\": \"EU Must Define Absorption Capacity While Maintaining Enlargement Promise and Creating Intermediate Membership Options\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"The speaker addresses the EU's enlargement strategy, focusing on the need to define the EU's absorption capacity for new members, the institutional challenges posed by previous enlargements without constitutional reform, and the need for intermediate membership options between neighborhood policy and full membership for countries like Ukraine and Western Balkans states.\",\n  \"positionSum\": \"Brok strongly supports EU enlargement as the most successful foreign policy tool for extending stability and peace, but emphasizes that promises made to candidate countries (particularly post-Thessaloniki commitments) cannot be withdrawn.

(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank your House and the chairman of its foreign policy committee for the thorough report on the Commission\u2019s 2005 strategy paper. This topic is the subject of constant discussion in the Council, not least with reference to the practical decisions that we have to take. As has been reported, we had in Gymnich a very good and thorough debate on this subject, and we will continue with it. I believe it to be quite essential that we should do so, since refusal to debate is a cause of public suspicion, and we must take care to reinforce the confidence of the European public in the European project as a whole and to create more trust and more clarity. That is one of my core concerns in my position as President-in-Office, and it is for that reason that I welcome the debate that is now underway.\nIt is because we need public support for the enlargement process that we have to improve the flow of information and our public relations work, while also explaining the individual steps better. We quite simply have to make it clear that we will be thorough and circumspect, and that, while we will not act precipitately, we will not arbitrarily step on the brakes either. This is something I regard as an essential consideration.\nHeaven forbid that we should, by introducing this concept of \u2018assimilation capacity\u2019, impose an additional and arbitrary obstacle; on the contrary, it is about being aware, becoming aware, and making others aware of certain quite central and self-evident fundamental truths. Every step in enlargement, every new accession requires two participants, one of them being the European Union, and the other the country that is to become a Member State.\nWe want to prepare for the next accessions as best we possibly can. In this sense, too, Salzburg was important to me, for it was important that we should look back over the last three years and forward to the next practical steps, in that it enabled all of us to be clearer about where we stand and what actual preparedness there is, whether at home or abroad. We can also have confidence in the expert knowledge that we gained during the last enlargement and should be determined to apply the knowledge of transformation that we have on a partnership basis.\nAs was said in the earlier debate, ownership, too, underlines European standards, which, though fair, must be stringently complied with, as was made unmistakeably clear in the Commission\u2019s report in November 2005.\nIn this debate, though, we should also be honest about the expectations people have of the European Union, not least the expectations of the people who live in it. We owe each other clarity, and it is we alone who can give it to each other. We must not make out cheques with nothing to back them up.\nMoreover, I urge a more nuanced approach to each individual country, for we need to be fair in our dealings with each and every one of them, and we must make that a certainty. The presidency will therefore be giving particular attention, in the ongoing debate, to the contributions made by your House.\nLet me sketch out, in just a few words, the actual decisions that we are currently working on. The first has to do with Romania and Bulgaria, concerning which the reports are encouraging and we already have the goal of accession on 1\u00a0January 2007, albeit with the possibility of its being delayed by a year. Turkey and Croatia\u2019s accession negotiations have begun; the starting pistol was officially fired on 3\u00a0October last year. We are now engaged in screening the acquis , that is to say in analysing the acquis communautaire. We, the presidency, have written to Croatia and Turkey to invite them to set out their negotiating position on the first chapter, \u2018Research and Development\u2019.\nWe share your House\u2019s view that continued progress in the fulfilment of all the political and economic criteria and in the effective realisation of fundamental rights, the rule of law and democracy is required. As regards Turkey, we in the presidency welcomed the closure of the Orhan Pamuk case and made it clear, at the recent meeting of the troika in Vienna, that we expect the trials still pending under Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code to be dealt with similarly, or, indeed, the law to be changed.\nWe, too, are closely monitoring the implementation of the Ankara protocol and will ensure that it is reviewed this year in the relevant bodies and in accordance with the Council statement of 21\u00a0September 2005.\nWe regard the commencement of the accession partnership with Croatia as equally important, and have welcomed the Croatian prime minister\u2019s undertaking to ensure unconditional cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and the continuation of the same. We share your House\u2019s view that Croatia is contributing more to regional cooperation and that further efforts are required.\nI have said what needs to be said about the Western Balkans. The Council\u2019s strategy for obtaining Serbia and Montenegro\u2019s full cooperation with the International War Crimes Tribunal is also clear, and we sent out a very clear signal relating to it at our last meeting. We support the UN special envoy in Kosovo, Martti Ahtisaari, in his work, and I believe that the European Union, through the efforts of its special delegate Javier Solana, is capable of helping, in an enormously positive and diplomatic way, to reach an agreement on the conditions for the 21\u00a0May referendum.\n(Applause)", "lang": "EN", "original": "Ursula Plassnik, President-in-Office of the Council .

Mr President, as he is still here, let me commend Mr Brok for his important report. As he rightly said, enlargement is indeed one of the EU\u2019s most powerful policy tools to pursue peace and prosperity, liberty and democracy. The eastern enlargement of 2004 sealed the peaceful reunification between Western and Eastern Europe. Now our energy is focused on a peaceful unification in south-east Europe. Our gradual and carefully managed accession process is based on three key principles.\nFirst, we have consolidated our enlargement agenda. It means that we must be cautious before taking any new commitments, but likewise we must stick to our prevailing commitments towards candidate or potential candidate countries already in the process. Our consolidated enlargement agenda focuses on south-east Europe: Bulgaria and Romania, and Turkey and Croatia and the other countries of the western Balkans.\nSecondly, we apply rigorous conditionality. Combined with a credible accession perspective, conditionality works. It has helped to transform Central and Eastern Europe into modern democracies. More recently, it has inspired bold and significant reforms in Turkey and increasingly in the western Balkans. This is also proven by some recent important events, as General Ante Gotovina is behind bars in The Hague, while the novelist Orhan Pamuk is free to express his opinions.\nEnlargement policy and neighbourhood policy complement each other. Furthermore, the Commission is ready to deepen further and upgrade cooperation with our neighbourhood partners once the main priorities in the current action plans have been properly addressed.\nAt the same time, we should avoid the pitfalls of an overly theoretical debate on the final borders of Europe. As we now have a consolidated enlargement agenda, a theoretical discussion, for example about whether Ukraine should even join the European Union, would benefit neither us nor the Ukrainians, now that Ukraine\u2019s future path and democratic development is at stake.\nCertainly, the pace of enlargement must take into consideration the EU\u2019s absorption capacity. The Commission has always had this view. Enlargement is about sharing a project based on common principles, policies and institutions. The Union must ensure that it can maintain its capacity to act and decide according to a fair balance within its institutions, respecting budgetary limits and implementing common policies that function well and achieve their goals.\nFor over three decades, the EU has successfully absorbed a very diverse set of countries, as we can see from the composition of this House, for instance, including the President in the Chair in charge of this debate and the Commissioner involved. By developing its policies and institutions, the Union has responded positively to new circumstances, such as the fall of dictatorships, the collapse of communism and the rise of economic globalisation. Enlargement has proven to be a successful shock absorber for Europe.\nThirdly, we need better communication. The report rightly calls for a communication strategy and, indeed, broad public support is essential for everything the Union does, including enlargement. I rely on the political and financial support of Parliament to pursue a well-informed debate on enlargement.\nTo conclude, consolidation was necessary to avoid overstretching on our enlargement commitments. But let us also keep in mind our own strategic interest: it would be utterly irresponsible to disrupt a valuable process that is helping to build stable and effective partners in the most unstable parts of Europe. If we were to go wobbly about the western Balkans\u2019 European perspective, our beneficial influence, our political leverage, our impact would be seriously eroded, just when the region enters a difficult period of talks on Kosovo\u2019s status.\nThe EU perspective is the key to a sustainable settlement for Kosovo and to democratic development in Serbia and the rest of the region. It is the foundation that keeps the region on a peaceful and reformist track. Therefore, for the sake of Europe, let us not shake this foundation, ensuring that the still fragile Balkans building does not collapse at our feet, in our own front yard!\n(Applause)", "lang": "EN", "original": "Olli Rehn, Member of the Commission .

Congratulations also to the Commissioner for the Commission's global and integral communication which you have presented to us.\nI should very quickly like to make the following comments:\nFirstly, the central view in the Brok report on the importance of the European prospects of a number of countries, most of which are in the Balkans, is correct. At the same time, paragraphs 5, 9 and 10 of the report, if read together, give the reference point on the basis of which the European Union now sees future enlargements.\nAs far as Turkey is concerned, I want to say that I support the European prospects of Turkey, but I think, as you quite rightly said, that we need to focus, initially, on the question of the Ankara Protocol. The Protocol alone \u2013 I repeat the Protocol alone \u2013 must be ratified, not the unilateral declaration, and, of course, the question of updating the legal framework within which this country operates.\nAs far as Kosovo is concerned, I agree that attention should be paid during negotiations to its final status, but we also need to prepare ourselves for how the decision taken on the final status of Kosovo is to be applied.\nAs far as the FYROM is concerned, it now has the status of a candidate country, that is correct but, precisely because it has the status of a candidate country, it also has rights and obligations, one of which is to demonstrate a constructive attitude in dialogue with Greece, so that the final issue pending, that of the name, can be resolved.\nFinally, as far as Serbia is concerned, I agree with the need and with the fact that Serbia's cooperation with the Tribunal in the Hague is its obligation, but this is one part of a set of criteria which Serbia needs to meet and I want to ask that we be careful not to 'Croatise' the case of Serbia.

Whilst the addition of ten new countries in 2004 was a success, not all citizens see it that way. An extra effort to recount this success story is therefore called for.\nOn behalf of the group, I can say that we support the thrust of the Brok report, and I would thank him for the interesting preparation round we have been involved in over the past few months. The Social\u00a0Democrats are emphatically in favour of the extra attention that is being devoted to the criterion of absorption capacity. The impasse surrounding the ratification of the Constitutional Treaty plays an important role in this. Without internal reforms, it will be difficult to steer the accession of new Member States effectively.\nAs expressed in previous resolutions, we take the view that the Treaty of Nice is not a basis for new decisions on accession. There is, however, more need for more clarity surrounding the concept of absorption capacity, as laid down in the Copenhagen criteria, and the report is right to devote attention to this aspect too.\nI should like to take this opportunity to outline where the Social Democrats stand in respect of the possible accession of various countries. As far as our easterly neighbours Ukraine and Moldova are concerned, we think that now is not the right time to discuss their accession. Instead, we should invest in practical cooperation. We have concluded action plans with those countries, and we should try to bring them to a successful end.\nWith regard to the Balkans, we back the Council\u2019s position. In principle, the western Balkan countries hold out the prospect of membership, although they will join at different times. As for Turkey, as far as we are concerned, we will continue on the chosen path. We are on the eve of starting a process that will last many years, and it is extremely important that we hold firm to the pledge, but also to the conditions, that we prescribed in this connection.\nWhile I am on the subject of the Balkans, I should like to add that, whilst it goes without saying that the Copenhagen criteria remain of vital importance to us, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament continues to set great store by cooperation with the Yugoslavia tribunal as a criterion. I also think \u2013 and there has been much talk about it \u2013 that regional cooperation can make a significant contribution to the rapprochement of those countries to the European Union.\nFinally \u2013 and this may well be the most important point of the whole discussion \u2013 the report mentions the possibility of setting up a fresh multilateral framework for European countries that have not yet joined the European Union. For some countries, that could be an alternative to membership, while for others, this could be an intermediate step towards it. For Ukraine and Moldova, for example, a structure of that kind could be a sound follow-up step, but for the countries that are already recognised as potential members, I would stress that this is an option, and not an obligation.\nThis is also how it is set out quite clearly in the Brok report. It is something for which those countries can opt, should they decide that it would be useful to them to do so. It is not an alternative to the prospect of membership. That applies to Turkey as well as to the Balkan countries. I want to stress that this is how we interpret paragraph 10 of the draft resolution. It is in that way, and no other, that we in the Committee on Foreign Affairs have reached agreement with the rapporteur.", "lang": "NL", "original": "Jan Marinus Wiersma, namens de PSE-Fractie . - Voorzitter, de Europese Commissie is in haar stuk klaar en helder. Er komt geen nieuwe uitbreidingsronde met een grote groep landen tegelijk, maar de Commissie stelt ook - en ik denk terecht - dat de Europese Unie een organisatie is en blijft die openstaat voor nieuwe leden, maar w\u00e8l onder voorwaarde. Tenslotte benadrukt de Commissie terecht het belang van communicatie. De uitbreiding met tien nieuwe lidstaten in 2004 is een succes geweest, toch voelen niet alle burgers dat zo. Een extra inspanning om dit succesverhaal te vertellen, is dan ook allerminst overbodig.\nNamens de fractie kan ik zeggen dat wij in grote lijnen het verslag van de heer Brok steunen en ik dank hem voor de interessante voorbereiding die we de afgelopen maanden hebben gehad. De sociaal-democraten staan volledig achter de extra aandacht voor het criterium van de absorptiecapaciteit. De impasse rond de ratificatie van het Grondwettelijk Verdrag speelt hierbij een belangrijke rol. Zonder interne hervormingen wordt het moeilijk de toetreding van nieuwe lidstaten in goede banen te leiden.\nZoals in eerdere resoluties is verwoord, zijn wij van mening dat het Verdrag van Nice geen basis is voor nieuwe beslissingen rond toetreding. Maar er is ook meer behoefte aan meer duidelijkheid rond het concept van absorptiecapaciteit, zoals dat is neergelegd in de Kopenhagen-criteria en ook daaraan besteedt het verslag terecht aandacht.\nIk wil deze gelegenheid aangrijpen om kort te schetsen waar de sociaal-democraten staan ten aanzien van de mogelijke toetreding van verschillende landen. Wat onze oostelijke buurlanden Oekra\u00efne en Moldavi\u00eb betreft, zijn wij van mening dat het op dit moment niet opportuun is een discussie over toetreding te voeren. Het beste wat wij kunnen doen is investeren in praktische samenwerking. Wij hebben met die landen actieplannen afgesproken en laten we proberen die tot een succes te maken.\nVoor de Balkan steunen we de stellingname van de Raad. De landen van de Westelijke Balkan hebben in principe uitzicht op lidmaatschap, maar dat zal voor verschillende landen in een verschillend tempo worden ingevuld. Met Turkije gaan we wat ons betreft op de ingeslagen weg voort. We staan aan het begin van een proces dat nog vele jaren gaat duren en het is uiterst belangrijk dat we vasthouden aan de toezegging, maar ook aan de voorwaarden die wij hebben gesteld.\nAl pratend over de Balkan wil ik nog toevoegen dat natuurlijk voor ons de Kopenhagen-criteria van essentieel belang blijven, maar daarnaast is ook volledige samenwerking met het Joegoslavi\u00eb-tribunaal een belangrijke eis van de PSE-Fractie. Ik denk ook - en daar is onlangs veel over gesproken - dat regionale samenwerking in die regio een belangrijke bijdrage kan leveren aan de toenadering van die landen tot de Europese Unie.\nTenslotte - en dat is waarschijnlijk het belangrijkste punt uit de hele discussie - spreekt het verslag van een mogelijkheid een nieuwe multilaterale structuur op te richten voor Europese landen die nog geen lid zijn van de Europese Unie. Voor sommige landen zou dit een alternatief kunnen zijn voor lidmaatschap, voor anderen een tussenstap op weg naar het lidmaatschap. Voor Oekra\u00efne en Moldavi\u00eb, bijvoorbeeld, zou een dergelijke structuur een goede vervolgstap kunnen zijn, maar voor de landen die reeds een erkend perspectief op lidmaatschap hebben, is dit een optie, met nadruk, en geen verplichting.\nZo is het ook heel duidelijk in het verslag van de heer Brok geformuleerd. Het is een optie waar deze landen zelf voor kunnen kiezen, als ze dat nuttig achten. Het is geen alternatief voor het perspectief op lidmaatschap, dat geldt voor Turkije en ook voor de landen van de Balkan. Ik wil dan ook benadrukken dat dit onze interpretatie is van paragraaf 10 van de ontwerpresolutie.

The unification of East and West in May 2004 marked the end of the division of Europe and showed what power there is in the dream of a unified Europe based on democracy, free trade and respect for the rule of law. EU membership was the spur that helped the powerful forces for reform in the former Communist dictatorships. The prospects of EU membership are also hugely important to the negotiations and reforms in Turkey and the Balkan states. In these regions, the EU has incredible reserves of what is known as soft power and which contributes to a more stable and more democratic Europe. We in my group believe that it is important, as the Treaty says, for us to keep the door to continued enlargement open. Naturally, the criteria must be applied, and the EU\u2019s capacity to receive new countries is an important consideration. We need, however, to change internally and to engage in the debate about enlargement without putting the blame on it.\nI am aware of the fact that there is an ongoing debate in many countries and concern about the rapid pace of EU enlargement and about the way in which things might develop. That conversation must be conducted respectfully and straightforwardly, but we must also dare to stand up for the advantages of enlargement and to call attention to these. In that context, the debate about economic protectionism is extremely worrying. We have a responsibility for neighbouring countries. Our promises to the Balkan states and to Turkey must be kept. It is they that set the pace, and we do what we can to speed things up. We must also keep the door open for other countries such as Ukraine and perhaps also, one day, Belarus, even though the situation there now is incredibly troubled. The hope of EU membership is what keeps the opposition and the forces of democracy alive there.\nThat is why we are opposed to defining Europe\u2019s geographical borders. This Parliament has given impetus to enlargement, and, a year ago, we stood in the Chamber in Brussels, wearing our orange scarves, and applauded President Yushchenko. We adopted a resolution in which we talked of Ukraine\u2019s prospects of membership. That is an objective, and perhaps a distant one. Just as Mr\u00a0Brok said, the Ukrainian people are poised between democracy and dictatorship. If we establish borders for Europe, they will interpret this in terms of our slamming the door in their face. It would be an historic mistake.\nInstead of introducing new concepts such as multilateral agreements, let us \u2013 as Commissioner Rehn also said \u2013 take the opportunity to customise the neighbourhood strategy for prospective Member States and to give practical shape to it. To now put forward new concepts which we have not properly debated and of whose implications we are unaware does not seem very productive at the moment.\n(Applause from various quarters)", "lang": "SV", "original": "Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, f\u00f6r ALDE-gruppen . \u2013 Herr talman!

Enandet av \u00f6st och v\u00e4st i maj 2004 markerade slutet p\u00e5 Europas delning och visar vilken kraft det finns i dr\u00f6mmen om ett enat Europa som bygger p\u00e5 demokrati, \u00f6ppen handel och respekt f\u00f6r r\u00e4ttsstaten. EU-medlemskapet var den morot som hj\u00e4lpte de starka reformkrafterna i de forna kommunistdiktaturerna, utsikterna till medlemskap har ocks\u00e5 en enorm betydelse f\u00f6r f\u00f6rhandlingarna och reformerna i Turkiet och p\u00e5 Balkan.

We think that the concept of absorption capacity should be better defined. It is a trendy, all-purpose concept on which everyone can hang whatever they like, and that means that the question of geographical borders will need to be answered, for we can no longer dodge that question.\nWe share the view that it is necessary that the EU will think about an intermediate step between full membership and neighbourhood, for the sake of those countries that have no membership perspective as yet. I am not, therefore, talking about Turkey or the western Balkans, but rather about Ukraine, Moldova or Belarus. I have to say that my group and I were deeply disappointed, and extremely vexed frankly, to see that in the run-up to this debate, the media twisted the words in the report, the result running counter to a number of central points.\nIf we read the media ahead of this debate, the ultimate conclusion is that an intermediate step should be created for countries including Turkey and the western Balkans. It is no coincidence \u2013 for let us be quite honest about this \u2013 that this happens to be the view held by the rapporteur, and one that he never had any intention of concealing. Mr Brok has always been opposed to opening negotiations with Turkey and has, since the rejection of the constitution, increasingly grown sceptical about the membership perspective of the western Balkans. The rapporteur is fully entitled to his view, but that is not the view of the majority of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. What is more, it is not what his own report states either.\nIt would become the rapporteur to spell out, outside of this Chamber, what is in his report, and does not mistake its contents for notions of his own. What Parliament states in this report is that we do not want to tamper with the membership perspective of Turkey and the western Balkans and that intermediate steps would only be an option for those countries if they themselves were to decide in favour of it. Everyone knows just as well as I do that all those western Balkan countries and Turkey do not want to go down that route; they want full membership.

Die vraag, collega's, kan niet langer worden ontweken.\nEn ja, volgens ons is het ook nodig dat de EU eens gaat nadenken over een soort tussenvorm tussen volledig lidmaatschap en nabuurschap, voor die landen die nog geen perspectief op lidmaatschap hebben. Dan gaat het dus niet over Turkije, dan gaat het niet over de Westelijke Balkan, maar dan gaat het over Oekra\u00efne, Moldavi\u00eb of Wit-Rusland.

Het is geen toeval, collega's, laten we daar eerlijk over zijn, het is de mening van de rapporteur, hij heeft dat nooit onder stoelen of banken gestoken; mijnheer Brok was altijd tegen het starten van onderhandelingen met Turkije en is na het verwerpen van de grondwet steeds meer gaan twijfelen aan het lidmaatschapsperspectief van de Westelijke Balkan. Dat is het goed recht van de rapporteur, maar dat is niet de opvatting van de meerderheid van de Commissie Buitenlandse Zaken; het is niet, en dat is nog veel belangrijker, wat er in zijn eigen verslag staat.\nHet zou de rapporteur dan ook sieren als hij klip en klaar ook buiten deze kamer zou zeggen wat er in zijn verslag staat en dat niet verwisselt met de fantasie in zijn hoofd.

It was seen as a reunification of Europe and as the victory of the West in the Cold War. After the major enlargement of 2004, that climate changed dramatically. Public opinion in the old Member States does not experience this enlargement as a success, particularly as a result of the increasing exploitation of the disparity between high-wage and low-wage countries.\nThe politicians too, are distancing themselves from it. This change is palpable in the report on the enlargement strategy that is the topic of today\u2019s debate. Attention is being drawn to the EU\u2019s absorption capacity, to the external borders, the costs that are involved in enlargement and to administrative problems that are attributed to the absence of a European constitution. As a result, Romania and Bulgaria are likely to be the last countries that are allowed to join in the short term. Other European states are being referred to the neighbourhood policy. Even for the three countries that have already been selected as candidate countries, no date of accession has been given.\nEverywhere across the western Balkans, in recognised states, as well as in federal states or protectorates striving towards independence, where groups of people who speak different languages and practise different religions, and who, in the 1990s, were at daggers drawn with each other, public opinion now expects miracles of a swift accession process to the European Union. The EU uses those expectations to demand reforms, and in that way, makes deep incursions into the administrative choices that are being made over there.\nThe EU does not, for the time being, want enlargement, but it does want influence outside of its borders. That is why Bosnia and Herzegovina now have a tax system that nobody asked for, and the regional autonomy that was guaranteed in the Dayton agreement is being pushed back. According to the propaganda posters, it is thanks to the EU\u2019s military presence that this country is on its way to joining the European Union. Public opinion in Montenegro and Kosovo, areas where four years ago, along with 12 Member States, the euro was introduced as legal tender, take it as read that they will soon be admitted to the EU as independent states, while the Hungarian-speaking people of Vojvodina expect protection against Slav dominance.\nSo far, the EU\u2019s actions have left all these people disappointed. Do we not have anything to offer those countries in the western Balkans other than the invitation to form a common market in the territory of the former Yugoslavia and to adapt their government and their economy to our wishes without them being able to join before 2020? My group can muster little enthusiasm for this proposal.\nWe also recognise, however, that thanks to this text, it is possible to stress that the forthcoming referendum in Montenegro must be taken seriously and that the conflict about the use of the name Macedonia should be resolved quickly in sound consultation between Greece and its northern neighbour. What is also positive is that in Kosovo, a solution must be found in the short term which accommodates the needs of both the large Albanian majority and the Serbian and Roma minorities.", "lang": "NL", "original": "Erik Meijer, namens de GUE/NGL-Fractie . - Voorzitter, tot voor kort werd een snelle en omvangrijke uitbreiding van de Europese Unie voorgesteld als een geweldige stap vooruit, die van iedereen steun verdient. Het werd gezien als een hereniging van Europa en als de overwinning van het westen in de koude oorlog. Na de grote uitbreiding van 2004 is dat klimaat sterk veranderd. De publieke opinie in de oude lidstaten ervaart die uitbreiding niet als een succes, vooral als gevolg van het toenemende misbruik dat wordt gemaakt van het verschil tussen landen met hoge lonen en landen met lage lonen.\nOok de politici worden steeds terughoudender. Rondom het verslag over de uitbreidingsstrategie waarover we vandaag spreken, wordt die verandering goed zichtbaar. Aandacht wordt gevraagd voor de opnamecapaciteit van de Europese Unie, voor de buitengrenzen, voor de kosten die door de uitbreiding moeten worden gemaakt en voor bestuurlijke problemen die worden toegeschreven aan het ontbreken van een Europese grondwet. Roemeni\u00eb en Bulgarije lijken daardoor de laatste landen die nog binnen afzienbare tijd mogen toetreden. Andere Europese staten worden verwezen naar het nabuurschapsbeleid. Zelfs de drie landen die al tot kandidaat-lidstaat zijn uitgeroepen, wordt geen datum van toetreding in het vooruitzicht gesteld.\nOveral in de Westelijke Balkan, in erkende staten en in naar zelfstandigheid strevende deelstaten of protectoraten, waar groepen mensen die in taal en godsdienst verschillen in de jaren '90 scherp tegenover elkaar hebben gestaan, verwacht de publieke opinie nu wonderen van een snelle toetreding tot de Europese Unie. De Unie gebruikt die verwachtingen om hervormingen te eisen en daarmee diep in te grijpen in bestuurlijke keuzes die daar gemaakt worden.\nDe Unie wil voorlopig geen uitbreiding, maar wel invloed buiten de eigen grenzen. Zo heeft Bosni\u00eb-Herzegovina inmiddels een belastingstelsel dat niemand daar wilde, en wordt de in het Dayton-akkoord gegarandeerde regionale autonomie teruggedrongen. Er staat op de propaganda-affiches dat dankzij de aanwezigheid van een Europese militaire macht, dit land op weg is naar de Europese Unie. De publieke opinie in Montenegro en Kosovo, gebieden waar vier jaar geleden tegelijk met twaalf lidstaten de euro is ingevoerd als wettig betaalmiddel, gaat er nu al vanuit dat men spoedig als zelfstandige staten tot de Unie wordt toegelaten. In de Vojvodina verwacht de Hongaarstalige bevolking bescherming tegen de Slavische dominantie.\nIn al die gevallen roept het optreden van de Unie tot nu toe teleurstelling op. Hebben wij die landen in de Westelijke Balkan niet meer te bieden dan de uitnodiging om voor het grondgebied van het voormalige Joegoslavi\u00eb samen een gemeenschappelijke markt te vormen en hun bestuur en hun economie aan onze wensen aan te passen zonder dat ze voor 2020 kunnen toetreden? Mijn fractie kan weinig enthousiasme opbrengen voor dit voorstel.\nAnderzijds erkennen wij dat deze tekst de mogelijkheid biedt om te benadrukken dat het komende referendum in Montenegro serieus genomen moet worden en dat het conflict over het gebruik van de naam Macedoni\u00eb snel in goed overleg tussen Griekenland en zijn noordelijke buurstaat moet worden opgelost. Positief is ook dat in Kosovo snel een oplossing moet worden gevonden die zowel voorziet in de behoefte van de grote Albanese meerderheid als in die van de minderheden van Servi\u00ebrs en Roma.", "agenda_item": "2005 enlargement strategy paper (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060315-ITEM-009", "intervention_id": "3-237", "summary_english": "{\n\"headline\": \"EU Enlargement Strategy Criticized for Creating False Hopes While Avoiding Real Commitment to Western Balkans\",\n\"issueSum\": \"The speaker raises concerns about the EU's changed approach to enlargement after 2004, noting decreased public support in old Member States due to wage disparities, politicians distancing themselves from enlargement, focus on absorption capacity and costs, and the EU creating expectations in Western Balkans countries while not offering genuine accession prospects before 2020.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"The speaker is critical of the EU's current enlargement strategy, arguing it creates false expectations in Western Balkans countries while the EU seeks influence without genuine commitment to membership.

Sad to say, there is one candidate country pervaded by chauvinism: that country is Turkey, which is the subject of enough controversy already.\nAgainst this current backdrop, I have two questions I would like to put to Commissioner Rehn. Is there any truth in the information, which I received from an expert last night, that the position of the Christian churches in Turkey has visibly deteriorated lately?\nIn light of this information, the assassination of the Italian priest, Andrea Santoro, on 5 February, in the port of Trabzon is not an isolated case. An identical murder was attempted very recently in the town of Mersin and direct threats are against churches via the telephone or even in newspaper columns. Incidentally, according to the Anglican vicar Ian Sherwood, who is active in Istanbul, the Turkish elite regards the spread of Christian literature in Turkish as intellectually unacceptable, if not potentially criminal. How, Commissioner, can that be reconciled with freedom of religion in Turkey? As far as I can gather, no progress whatsoever is being made with regard to this important item of the political criteria of Copenhagen.\nI happened to hear last night that Trabzon is situated in what is called the valley of wolves. \u2018Valley of the Wolves\u2019 is also the title of an original Turkish film production which literally oozes chauvinism and is known to be radically anti-Christian, anti-Semitic, anti-American and anti-Kurdish. It is already a huge box-office hit in Turkey and has won euphoric acclaim from Prime Minister Erdogan\u2019s immediate entourage and the president of the Turkish Parliament.\nI should like to ask the Commissioner whether he has taken Prime Minister Erdogan and Minister Gul to task over this Turkish chauvinism, which is completely incompatible with European values.", "lang": "NL", "original": "Bastiaan Belder, namens de IND/DEM-Fractie . - Mijnheer de Voorzitter, hypernationalisme ofwel chauvinisme laten zich moeilijk verenigen met het lidmaatschap van de Europese Unie.

Treurig genoeg maakt zich chauvinisme vandaag juist breed in een reeds zeer omstreden toetredingskandidaat, Turkije.\nTegen deze actuele achtergrond wil ik commissaris Rehn een tweetal vragen voorleggen. Klopt de informatie die ik gisteravond mondeling van een expert ontving, dat de positie van de christelijke kerken in Turkije de laatste tijd zienderogen verslechtert?\nZo zou de moord op de Italiaanse geestelijke, Andrea Santoro, op 5 februari, in de havenplaats Trabzon niet op zichzelf staan.

Torture is still rife, and based on Article 301 of the criminal law among others, the free expression of opinion and freedom of the press cannot be guaranteed. Also, Turkey blatantly fails to meet its obligations in connection with the customs union. Cypriot ships and aircraft are still not admitted to Turkey\u2019s territory.\nOver the past weeks, we have also noticed tension escalating between the Turkish authorities and certain Kurdish groups. No one other than the second-in-command of Turkey\u2019s army is being accused of having stage-managed a bomb attack with a view to blaming the Kurds. Some of the military see this indictment as a ploy directed by the government, which would like to destabilise the general in question on account of his attitude towards Muslim fundamentalism.\nIn some quarters, the possibility of a fresh military coup is even mooted, should the situation escalate any further.\nIt must be admitted that there seems little to look forward to, and that in a country that aspires to join the European Union in a few years\u2019 time. We should, in fact, come clean and say that it is totally absurd. The report is right to remind us that the Copenhagen criteria include our own absorption capacity.

Each of them has its own particular problems and needs to be judged on the basis of its own achievements, and so it would be highly desirable for consideration to be given to Croatia\u2019s accession at an early date. To do so would send an important message of stabilisation to the entire region, since Croatia's achievements in both the political and economic spheres are in no respect inferior to those of the next two accession countries.\nNow, though, that we are coming to the close of the debate, I want to address an idea \u2013 one that is concealed in the Brok report, but more prominent in the public media. I refer to the allusions to changes in the enlargement strategy. The question is asked as to where the borders of the EU are, but nobody is answering it. Commissioner Rehn himself said earlier on that this is a question that has to be answered, and it is precisely this that has the public worried. My personal view is that the accessions of Bulgaria, Romania and the countries of the Western Balkans will mean that the EU will have reached its limits. For all the other countries, we have devised the new instrument of the Neighbourhood Policy and must get to grips with it. The rushed negotiations with Turkey have done what remained to be done to make our citizens insecure and disoriented.\nFor ten years we have been saying that there must be no enlargement without institutional reform of the EU, but the Council did not begin to do justice to that until after the last enlargement, and for that we were all punished by the results of the referendums in France and the Netherlands. But it would be fatal if we were, on that basis, to draw the conclusion that no further accessions must be allowed. We must waste no time in laying hold of the necessary instruments, for which, of course, the Constitutional Treaty makes provision, and use them to restore our capacity to welcome new members. If we do not want to jeopardise what has been up to now our great commitment to the Balkans, we must remain consistent and purposeful in continuing to bring these countries closer to the EU.\nI very much welcome what both Commissioner Rehn and Mrs Plassnik have had to say on this subject. All these states were rightly promised accession to the EU subject to their fulfilling the criteria. That was and remains an important motor for change in the aftermath of the terrible conflicts in the former Yugoslavia and of Ever Hoxha\u2019s dictatorship in Albania. It is apparent to any rational person who even casts a glance at a map that this region is in the middle of the EU. If it enjoys stability, then so do we. The 1990s saw us all experiencing and suffering the opposite of that, but I do fear \u2013 and I can tell the President-in-Office of the Council that the vagueness and imprecision of what was said in Salzburg gives me reason to \u2013 that certain Europeans are intent on leaving the South-East European states in the lurch a second time, and that is what we cannot allow to happen.", "lang": "DE", "original": "Doris Pack (PPE-DE). \u2013 Herr Pr\u00e4sident, Herr Kommissar, Frau Ratspr\u00e4sidentin!

Auf die Frage \u201eWo sind die Grenzen der EU?\u201c gibt niemand eine Antwort. Herr Rehn hat vorhin selbst gesagt, darauf m\u00fcsste man eine Antwort geben.

Dem aber wurde der Rat erst nach der letzten Erweiterung wirklich gerecht. Und daf\u00fcr wurden wir alle durch die Referenden in Frankreich und in den Niederlanden abgestraft. Just daraus aber den Schluss zu ziehen, keine Aufnahmen mehr zuzulassen, w\u00e4re fatal.

Our debates can no longer be about our preference for one country rather than another; instead, we must, at last, face up to the question as to what sort of political system the European Union can actually afford if it is to become better able to take decisions and act on them. That is the fundamental issue on which all others depend.\nIt is for that reason that our next step must be to clarify terms that have not as yet been defined. The Copenhagen criteria make reference to the concept of \u2018assimilation capacity\u2019, while not, however, defining it. As I see it, it must involve at least the political and institutional arrangements set out in the Constitutional Treaty.\nWhile I have listened attentively to what the Commissioner has said, he can correct me if I am wrong, but I have not heard him say anything about this. Inherent in the decision as to what is a criterion of capacity to assimilate is the potential source of dissent between us and the Commission. Among the important criteria are that the European Union should be funded in such a way as to have a viable future and its being accepted by the people who live in it. If we are to talk in terms of credibility, that credibility, and the criteria that can properly be applied to capacity to assimilate, require that it should not be possible for another country to accede for the foreseeable future once Bulgaria and Romania have done so. Credibility is about more than a promise to accept people at some unspecified time; it is also about specifying the conditions under which they can be accepted at all, and that means that we have to be more precise about such concepts as \u2018enlargement perspective\u2019 or \u2018prospect of accession\u2019.\nWe have to be very clear in our own minds that the belief that a country\u2019s accession will resolve tensions and internal security problems is an erroneous one.

We no longer know where Europe is: we have reached Diabakir and, if tomorrow the Americans tell us that Iraq needs to join Europe for reasons of equilibrium, shall we reach the Indian Ocean? That is the question. Who decides who will join Europe? Until recently we said no to Croatia. The prosecutor, Mrs Carla del Ponte, said no, Austria put on the pressure and Croatia is in. Is this the political will of Europe? Of course, it is not very smart to have to tell our friends the Turks that they must not insult the President of the European Parliament. It is not very smart for us to take them EUR 139\u00a0million in the occupied areas and for them to pelt the members of the European Parliament with eggs and stones. They need to change their attitude, not just one article in their constitution. They cannot have this special treatment. They cannot threaten a state of Europe with war, with a casus belli , while we talk about letting them in. Can they not recognise a government which has been recognised by the other 24? These are not logical formulations.\nThat brings me to the FYROM which, of course, is claiming a name. May I remind you that, when you applied to join the UN as the Germanic Republic of Austria, Germany \u2013 at that time vanquished Germany \u2013 vetoed it and you entered as Austria? May I remind you that the Bretons did not allow Great Britain to enter because they had Brittany and they joined as the United Kingdom? So why should you not support us, when we have a 3\u00a0000-year history with Macedonia?\nWhy do you not call a spade a spade? Why do we not have, at long last, an independent policy and have to follow the Americans' game of upsetting Russia and taking their satellites and opening up a front with Iran and so on? When at long last will Europe \u2013 and this is the question \u2013 decide that it is not the Americans' baby?

In their joint statement after their meeting in Paris, the UN Secretary General and President Papadopoulos stated, among other things, that it would be beneficial for all concerned and would greatly improve the atmosphere for further talks if progress could be achieved on further disengagement of forces and demilitarisation on the Island, on the complete de-mining of Cyprus and on the issue of Famagusta.\nIn particular, progress on the issue of Famagusta might also result in progress on the question of trade.

Reality is different: since the most recent enlargement by those countries, the Netherlands has earned EUR 2\u00a0billion annually. It is precisely those people who have always advocated this enlargement that have to communicate this very information on enlargement, while at the same time keeping an eye on the balance between enlarging and deepening, for this balance is lopsided at present. The Treaty of Nice was not really good enough for 25, and it will certainly not be enough when another two countries, namely Romania and Bulgaria, join us shortly. I think it would be good for us to commit ourselves to putting our own house in order first with a new treaty before we accept two more countries. We should commit to this off our own bat.\nSecondly, I think it important that countries on the edge should not wait for the European Union to finish its homework before they can start the deepening process with a kind of partnership. If they wish to become true members, and Europe appears to be able to cope, moving closer towards membership could then be the next step for them.\nThis report does not in any way detract from the rights of candidate countries that have this status at the moment, and I should like to make this quite clear. This credibility, however, must also go hand in hand with us attaching credibility to the criteria. This means, and Mrs\u00a0Plassnik is right in saying, that Turkey must monitor the free expression of opinion, not only for the sake of this one author, but also for others, that freedom of religion must be guaranteed and also that we make progress where Cyprus is concerned.\nWe welcome the Age Package Deal, but it would be brilliant \u2013 and I hope the Commissioner is taking note of this \u2013 if Turkey could be persuaded to ratify and implement the protocol. How do you intend to achieve this clarity, Commissioner? For once that is done, much progress will also be made in relation to Cyprus itself.

De werkelijkheid is anders: Nederland verdient 2 miljard euro per jaar aan de laatste uitbreiding met die landen.

Die balans is scheef. Het Verdrag van Nice was eigenlijk niet goed genoeg voor 25; nu komen Roemeni\u00eb en Bulgarije er nog bij.

In this respect, it is extremely worrying that on the basis of the proposal of the Council, affected countries will not receive adequate financial support in the future, and they will have less support next year and in the following years than they have had so far.

I am sure that if the European Union was able to formulate its position on all matters in this way, it would certainly be better supported and understood by its citizens. I would like to speak about the section of the report which talks about Turkey. I entirely agree that the European Union's expansion strategy has undoubtedly encouraged democratic, political and other reforms in Turkey and the other states mentioned in the resolution. However, it is equally important to note that, and I quote, \u2018while a political transition process is still underway in Turkey, in 2005 the pace of reforms has slowed and the implementation of reforms remains uneven\u2019. This is the exact reply I received yesterday from Commissioner Rehn to my verbal question on the implementation of the European Parliament's resolution on the start of negotiations with Turkey. This is also indicated in the draft resolution we have debated today, that is, that the pace of reforms in Turkey in 2005 was not only insufficient, but it actually has slowed down. This may be interpreted as Turkey's unpreparedness to carry out reforms which would bring it closer to the European Union, or perhaps even as an unwillingness to commit itself to the elementary obligations of possible membership.\nI also share the regret expressed in Mr Brok's report and in the resolution over the unilateral declaration made by Turkey when signing the Additional Protocol to the Ankara Agreement. I believe that it is necessary to remind Turkey that recognition of all European Union Member States is an indispensable component of the accession process.\nTrue, what I am about to say is not in the report, but I am sure that the acts of genocide committed against the Armenian nation 90 years ago should be recognised by Turkey at the highest level, as this more than any other action would bear testimony to the fact that Turkey's position, even regarding these painful events of the past, is in tune with the spirit of the Copenhagen criteria.", "lang": "LT", "original": "Laima Liucija Andrikien\u0117 (PPE-DE). \u2013 Pirmiausia nor\u0117\u010diau pad\u0117koti E.

However, as a strategic objective, enlargement can be the scapegoat for collective European impasses and that, in my opinion, should be avoided. Within this framework, the message sent by the Austrian Presidency and the meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs in Salzburg on the final objective of the integration of the countries of the Western Balkans into the European Union is indeed especially important. We are saying yes to the integration of the countries and no to special relationships.\nFrom this side, the Commission should speed up the submission of its proposal for the granting of entry visas to the citizens of the Balkan countries. The question is deeply political, not bureaucratic. The doublespeak in the European Union on Kosovo is causing concern. The absence of a joint EU policy will have negative consequences.\nFinally, as far as Cyprus is concerned, I believe that the time has come for political initiatives to be taken to create necessary political and social osmosis at the level of civil society between the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots.

Mr President, I should like to begin by imparting to you some breaking news: the decisions of late 2005 have created a solid political framework for our enlargement policy for 2006 to 2010, and in some cases even further. For instance, the accession negotiations with Turkey are likely to take 10 to 15 years. I do not expect anyone seriously to question our existing commitments in South-East Europe because it is really a matter of our own security and stability that we can enhance peace, democracy and increase prosperity in that very sensitive area.\nWe now have a consolidated and sufficiently demanding enlargement agenda. The enlargement train is no bullet train, no TGV, no Eurostar; it is a normal train or, in some cases, even a local train, but, most importantly, this train is moving, it is in the process and is thereby transforming the countries that are in the immediate neighbourhood of the European Union.\nConcerning the borders of Europe, the Commission works on the basis of Article 49 of the Treaty on European Union, which states that any European country that respects and applies the European values of democracy, human rights, the rule of law and fundamental freedoms may apply for membership of the Union. That does not mean that every European country must apply or that the EU must accept every country, but at the same time it means that it is not sensible to close the door forever by drawing a line across the map to define Europe once and for all, which would seriously damage our possibilities of having a beneficial influence and strategic leverage in our immediate neighbourhood.\nMeanwhile, although no final borders of the Union have yet been determined, the EU is developing other forms of partnership and cooperation with our neighbouring countries, for instance in the form of the European Neighbourhood Policy, which can be further developed and upgraded.\nA few comments and points have been made concerning absorption capacity. I would like to give a very brief historical overview. That concept was first explicitly mentioned in Copenhagen in 1993 when the European Council stated that the Union\u2019s capacity to absorb new members, while maintaining the momentum of European integration, is also an important consideration in the general interests of both the Union and the candidate countries. That concept and its consequences have been examined regularly by the Commission.\nIn its Agenda 2000 \u2013 and I am happy to refer to that because I was a member of the Steering Group for Agenda 2000, which was adopted in 1997 \u2013 the Commission examined the impact of the accession of central and eastern European countries from two angles: its impact on EU policies such as agriculture or regional policy, and its budgetary consequences. As a result, this work led to the setting of critical parameters in the negotiations that followed, in the decisions of March 1999 at the Berlin Summit and in 2003, when the countries of eastern and central Europe were allowed to join the European Union. This facilitated the accession of EU-10 and, by those means, we successfully combined our historic mission of reunifying the European continent and taking care of the practical considerations, which are also of concern to our citizens today.\nLater on, we examined that concept during the accession negotiations, in some chapters in particular, such as that on the free movement of persons and the financial chapters, and more recently the Commission also examined that concept in our 2004 Issues Paper on questions arising from the Turkish accession perspective.\nI would recommend this paper of October 2004 to all Members of the European Parliament. It is still worth reading and outlines very well the broad consequences of possible Turkish accession to the Union if, one day, Turkey meets all the conditions for accession.\nThus, the upsurge in capacity is an important concept, and it has also been referred to in the negotiating frameworks for Turkey and Croatia. I can assure you that we bear this in mind throughout the negotiations, and it is also a leading concept in our strategy document of last November. We base our work on that concept and it is a very important consideration.\nFinally, referring to what Mr Eurlings said about deepening and widening, I belong to the camp that thinks that the deepening of political integration is indispensable in order to make the European Union more effective and democratic. We must make the Union function better, and that was and is the purpose of the Constitutional Treaty. Therefore, we need a constitutional debate and, in time \u2013 sooner rather than later \u2013 we need to decide on how we reform our structures so that they are more effective and democratic and so that the European Union can have more clout in external relations, in Common Foreign and Security Policy and in preserving the security of its own citizens against international crime and terrorism.\nThat must be done in the near future, not in the distant future \u2013 not in 10 to 15 years, for instance, when Turkey might be able to join \u2013 for the sake of Europe, and we need it already for the European Union of 25 or 27 Member States.

Debate Information\n\n**Topic:** 2005 enlargement strategy paper (debate)  \n**Date:** 2005 (specific date not provided)  \n**Number of Contributions:** 37 speakers contributed to the debate  \n**Context:** Parliamentary discussion on the European Union's enlargement strategy following the 2004 expansion, addressing future candidate countries and the EU's capacity for further expansion.\n\n## 2. Executive Summary\n\nThe debate revealed significant divisions among parliamentarians regarding the EU's future enlargement strategy, with speakers generally falling into three camps: enlargement advocates, cautious supporters emphasizing absorption capacity, and critics calling for stricter limits or opposition to specific candidates.\n\n### Key Issues and Positions\n\n**Absorption Capacity and EU Institutional Reform**\nSeveral speakers emphasized the need to define the EU's \"absorption capacity\" before proceeding with further enlargement. Elmar Brok argued that \"we ask the Commission, by the end of the year, to define what is meant by the European Union's absorption capacity\" [Brok, 2005], while Jan Marinus Wiersma noted that \"without internal reforms, it will be difficult to steer the accession of new Member States effectively\" [Wiersma, 2005]. Helmut Kuhne took a more restrictive stance, stating \"it should not be possible for another country to accede for the foreseeable future once Bulgaria and Romania have done so\" [Kuhne, 2005].\n\n**Western Balkans Integration**\nThere was broad consensus supporting the Western Balkans' EU membership prospects. Commissioner Olli Rehn warned that \"it would be utterly irresponsible to disrupt a valuable process that is helping to build stable and effective partners in the most unstable parts of Europe\" [Rehn, 2005]. Doris Pack emphasized regional significance, noting her fear \"that certain Europeans are intent on leaving the South-East European states in the lurch a second time, and that is what we cannot allow to happen\" [Pack, 2005].\n\n**Turkey's Candidacy**\nTurkey's membership generated the most contentious debate. While Commissioner Rehn defended the process, stating \"combined with a credible accession perspective, conditionality works. It has helped to transform Central and Eastern Europe into modern democracies\" [Rehn, 2005], critics like Bastiaan Belder argued \"there is one candidate country pervaded by chauvinism: that country is Turkey\" [Belder, 2005]. Philip Claeys called for reversing \"the decision to open negotiations with Turkey\" based on fundamental problems [Claeys, 2005].\n\n**Eastern European Countries**\nDebate emerged over Ukraine and Moldova's prospects. Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m warned that establishing borders for Europe would be interpreted as \"slamming the door in their face. It would be an historic mistake\" [Malmstr\u00f6m, 2005], while Marianne Mikko advocated that \"there are two countries even closer to the heart of Europe which need the promise of European Union membership just as much as the Balkan countries and Turkey\" [Mikko, 2005].\n\n**Intermediate Membership Arrangements**\nSeveral speakers proposed creating intermediate options between full membership and neighborhood policy. Brok suggested a \"European Economic Area plus\" covering \"internal market participation, internal and external security, environmental policy and much else besides\" [Brok, 2005]. However, Joost Lagendijk clarified that such arrangements \"would only apply to countries without membership prospects (Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus) and only if those countries choose such arrangements themselves\" [Lagendijk, 2005].\n\n### Key Proposals and Arguments\n\nSpeakers proposed various solutions including:\n- Defining absorption capacity criteria by year-end (Brok)\n- Creating multilateral cooperation frameworks as alternatives or stepping stones to membership (Wiersma, Vaidere)\n- Prioritizing constitutional reform before further expansion (Eurlings, Pinior)\n- Maintaining strict adherence to Copenhagen criteria while providing clear timelines (Neyts-Uyttebroeck, \u017ddanoka)\n\n**Opposition Voices**\nSome speakers opposed continued enlargement entirely. Roger Knapman argued that \"all we are getting here is more centralisation at the same time as more expansion to make an unworkable whole\" [Knapman, 2005], while Erik Meijer criticized the EU for \"creating false expectations in Western Balkans countries while not offering genuine accession prospects before 2020\" [Meijer, 2005].\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe debate highlighted the EU's challenge of balancing enlargement commitments with institutional capacity concerns. While most speakers supported continuing enlargement for the Western Balkans and maintaining Turkey's process, significant disagreement emerged over geographical limits, timeline expectations, and the need for intermediate arrangements. The emphasis on defining \"absorption capacity\" and improving public communication about enlargement benefits reflected growing concerns about public support for the EU's expansion policy.", "src_model": "claude", "model_type": "claude", "model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "structured": true, "incremental": false, "hierarchical": false, "grouped": false, "shuffle": false, "prompt": false, "lang": "english"}
