{"speaker": "Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m,", "english": "Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, on behalf of the ALDE Group. \u2013 (SV) Mr\u00a0President, enlargement is the EU\u2019s greatest success in terms of European cooperation. The unification of East and West in May 2004 marked the end of the division of Europe and showed what power there is in the dream of a unified Europe based on democracy, free trade and respect for the rule of law. EU membership was the spur that helped the powerful forces for reform in the former Communist dictatorships. The prospects of EU membership are also hugely important to the negotiations and reforms in Turkey and the Balkan states. In these regions, the EU has incredible reserves of what is known as soft power and which contributes to a more stable and more democratic Europe. We in my group believe that it is important, as the Treaty says, for us to keep the door to continued enlargement open. Naturally, the criteria must be applied, and the EU\u2019s capacity to receive new countries is an important consideration. We need, however, to change internally and to engage in the debate about enlargement without putting the blame on it.\nI am aware of the fact that there is an ongoing debate in many countries and concern about the rapid pace of EU enlargement and about the way in which things might develop. That conversation must be conducted respectfully and straightforwardly, but we must also dare to stand up for the advantages of enlargement and to call attention to these. In that context, the debate about economic protectionism is extremely worrying. We have a responsibility for neighbouring countries. Our promises to the Balkan states and to Turkey must be kept. It is they that set the pace, and we do what we can to speed things up. We must also keep the door open for other countries such as Ukraine and perhaps also, one day, Belarus, even though the situation there now is incredibly troubled. The hope of EU membership is what keeps the opposition and the forces of democracy alive there.\nThat is why we are opposed to defining Europe\u2019s geographical borders. This Parliament has given impetus to enlargement, and, a year ago, we stood in the Chamber in Brussels, wearing our orange scarves, and applauded President Yushchenko. We adopted a resolution in which we talked of Ukraine\u2019s prospects of membership. That is an objective, and perhaps a distant one. Just as Mr\u00a0Brok said, the Ukrainian people are poised between democracy and dictatorship. If we establish borders for Europe, they will interpret this in terms of our slamming the door in their face. It would be an historic mistake.\nInstead of introducing new concepts such as multilateral agreements, let us \u2013 as Commissioner Rehn also said \u2013 take the opportunity to customise the neighbourhood strategy for prospective Member States and to give practical shape to it. To now put forward new concepts which we have not properly debated and of whose implications we are unaware does not seem very productive at the moment.\n(Applause from various quarters)", "lang": "SV", "original": "Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, f\u00f6r ALDE-gruppen . \u2013 Herr talman! Utvidgningen \u00e4r EU:s st\u00f6rsta framg\u00e5ng i det europeiska samarbetet. Enandet av \u00f6st och v\u00e4st i maj 2004 markerade slutet p\u00e5 Europas delning och visar vilken kraft det finns i dr\u00f6mmen om ett enat Europa som bygger p\u00e5 demokrati, \u00f6ppen handel och respekt f\u00f6r r\u00e4ttsstaten. EU-medlemskapet var den morot som hj\u00e4lpte de starka reformkrafterna i de forna kommunistdiktaturerna, utsikterna till medlemskap har ocks\u00e5 en enorm betydelse f\u00f6r f\u00f6rhandlingarna och reformerna i Turkiet och p\u00e5 Balkan. EU har h\u00e4r en oerh\u00f6rd k\u00e4lla till s\u00e5 kallad soft power som bidrar till ett stabilare och mer demokratiskt Europa. Vi i min grupp menar att det \u00e4r viktigt att vi h\u00e5ller d\u00f6rren \u00f6ppen f\u00f6r fortsatt utvidgning, s\u00e5som f\u00f6rdraget s\u00e4ger. Naturligtvis skall kriterierna till\u00e4mpas, och EU:s f\u00f6rm\u00e5ga att ta emot \u00e4r viktig. Men vi beh\u00f6ver f\u00f6r\u00e4ndras internt och inte skylla p\u00e5 utvidgningen, utan ta den diskussionen.\nJag \u00e4r medveten om att det p\u00e5g\u00e5r en diskussion i m\u00e5nga l\u00e4nder och en oro f\u00f6r att EU v\u00e4xer f\u00f6r fort och hur det ska g\u00e5. Det samtalet m\u00e5ste f\u00f6ras \u00f6dmjukt och r\u00e4ttframt, men vi m\u00e5ste ocks\u00e5 v\u00e5ga st\u00e5 upp f\u00f6r utvidgningens f\u00f6rdelar och framh\u00e5lla dem. I det sammanhanget \u00e4r diskussionen om den ekonomiska protektionismen v\u00e4ldigt bekymmersam. Vi har ett ansvar f\u00f6r v\u00e5ra grannl\u00e4nder. L\u00f6ftena till Balkan och Turkiet skall h\u00e5llas. Det \u00e4r de som best\u00e4mmer takten, och vi g\u00f6r vad vi kan f\u00f6r att skynda p\u00e5 den. Vi m\u00e5ste ocks\u00e5 h\u00e5lla \u00f6ppet f\u00f6r andra l\u00e4nder som Ukraina och kanske ocks\u00e5, en dag, Vitryssland, \u00e4ven om situationen d\u00e4r nu \u00e4r oerh\u00f6rt bekymmersam. Hoppet om ett europeiskt medlemskap \u00e4r det som h\u00e5ller oppositionen och demokratikrafterna levande d\u00e4r.\nD\u00e4rf\u00f6r \u00e4r vi emot att definiera Europas geografiska gr\u00e4nser Europa. Detta parlament har varit p\u00e5drivande f\u00f6r utvidgningen och vi stod i kammaren i Bryssel, kl\u00e4dda i orangea sjalar, f\u00f6r ett \u00e5r sedan och appl\u00e5derade president Jusjtjenko. Vi antog en resolution d\u00e4r vi talade om Ukrainas utsikter till medlemskap. Det \u00e4r en m\u00e5ls\u00e4ttning \u2013 det kanske \u00e4r l\u00e5ngt kvar. Ukrainas folk st\u00e5r och v\u00e4ger, precis som Brok sa, mellan demokrati och diktatur. Om vi s\u00e4tter upp gr\u00e4nser f\u00f6r Europa kommer de att uppfatta det som om vi sl\u00e4nger igen d\u00f6rren i ansiktet p\u00e5 dem. Det vore ett historiskt misstag.\nIst\u00e4llet f\u00f6r att introducera nya koncept, som multilaterala avtal, l\u00e5t oss f\u00f6rst \u2013 som ocks\u00e5 kommission\u00e4r Rehn sa \u2013 utnyttja m\u00f6jligheten att individualisera och konkretisera grannskapsstrategin f\u00f6r de medlemmarna. Att nu l\u00e4gga fram nya koncept som vi inte riktigt har diskuterat och som vi inte vet vad de inneb\u00e4r k\u00e4nns inte s\u00e5 fruktbart f\u00f6r stunden.\n(Spridda appl\u00e5der)", "agenda_item": "2005 enlargement strategy paper (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060315-ITEM-009", "intervention_id": "3-235", "summary_english": "{\n\"headline\": \"EU Must Keep Enlargement Door Open Despite Concerns, Avoid Defining Geographic Borders\",\n\"issueSum\": \"The speaker addresses the ongoing debate and concerns about the rapid pace of EU enlargement, economic protectionism related to enlargement, and the question of defining Europe's geographical borders.
