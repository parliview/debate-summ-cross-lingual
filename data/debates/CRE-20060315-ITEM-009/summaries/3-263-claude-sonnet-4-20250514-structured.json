Moldova has been making a huge effort for two years.\nUkraine has also recently shown that it wishes to become a European country. I sensed that very clearly when I visited Ukraine last week.\nI am disappointed, however, with the excessive emphasis placed on the fourth Copenhagen criterion in the report. At the same time, I agree with Elmar Brok that the European Commission should define the nature of accession capacity as soon as possible. This should not be a vague excuse for rejecting countries wishing to accede to the European Union.\nSince the Thessaloniki Summit in 2003, our union has been reformed. This is the success story of those countries that fulfilled the Copenhagen criteria. Potential candidate countries must in future also be evaluated on the basis of transparent criteria.\nExpansion must continue, because Europe needs stability in the same way it needs air.", "lang": "ET", "original": "Marianne Mikko (PSE). \u2013 Kallid kolleegid, raport\u00f6\u00f6r Elmar Brok on teinud p\u00f5hjaliku t\u00f6\u00f6, n\u00e4itamaks L\u00e4\u00e4ne-Balkani maadele teed Euroopa Liitu.\nAga minu kui Moldova-delegatsiooni juhi kohustus on meenutada, et Euroopa s\u00fcdamele veelgi l\u00e4hemal on kaks riiki, kes vajavad Euroopa Liidu liikmelisuse perspektiivi samapalju nagu Balkan ja T\u00fcrgi.\nEuroparlament ongi selgelt v\u00e4ljendanud toetust nii Ukraina kui Moldova p\u00fcrgimustele saada Euroopa Liidu liikmekandidaadiks.
