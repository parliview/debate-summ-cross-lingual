Do we want a free-trade OSCE to stabilise a problematic neighbourhood, or do we want a political union empowered to act on the basis of its own laws? The Brok report is a good thing, in that it really does change the perspective in favour of the second option.\nIt is said of us politicians in general that we are incapable of giving praise, but the SPD\u2019s Mr Kuhne has just spoken on the basis of an outstanding document that the German Social Democrats have adopted, and the absolutely marvellous thing about it is that it defines where the SPD stands on enlargement.\nIt is indeed the case that, as regards Bulgaria and Romania, the decisions have been taken, but we have to consider the possibility of treating them separately if their performance so warrants. It is not the means that are crucial, but the ends. It is quite possible that negotiations with Turkey will produce an outcome other than full membership, and here comes a key sentence: \u2018We will no longer go along with the progressive softening-up of the accession criteria,\u2019 say the German Social Democrats, and we German Free Democrats agree with them one hundred per cent.\nAssimilation capacity is also defined; here, the main problem is that the European Union\u2019s capacity to assimilate the new members is in part dependent on the agreement in principle of the people in the Member States. I see that as quite crucial if we want to carry the public with us. If we want them to remain good and faithful citizens of the European Union, we will have to take their wishes into account.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Alexander Lambsdorff (ALDE). \u2013 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when discussing enlargement, we are, in essence, discussing our understanding of the European Union.
