This endeavour is right, because it encourages cooperation and taking responsibility, and it also brings economic advantages.\nIt is not right, however, to force an economic or political unity that is not wanted by those affected, or is not viable in itself. It would be much more effective to enlarge the already existing CEFTA, as proposed by the Croatian Government, because it has already proved to be a successful and good cooperation, and this is where the Balkan States should be included.\nThe true guarantee of stability in the West Balkans is the authentic promise of European integration. In this respect, it is extremely worrying that on the basis of the proposal of the Council, affected countries will not receive adequate financial support in the future, and they will have less support next year and in the following years than they have had so far. And this casts doubts on the credibility of the entire accession process. Therefore, we want to see a considerable increase in available funds.\nThirdly: when assessing each country, we must consider their individual achievements, and en bloc or collective assessments of any kind cannot be accepted, because these countries must show their maturity individually.\nCroatia has done a great deal in order to become a Member State of the European Union as soon as possible. We must recognise these efforts, because Croatia deserves to conclude the negotiations successfully, as soon as possible.", "lang": "HU", "original": "Istv\u00e1n Szent-Iv\u00e1nyi (ALDE). \u2013 Tisztelt Eln\u00f6k \u00dar!
