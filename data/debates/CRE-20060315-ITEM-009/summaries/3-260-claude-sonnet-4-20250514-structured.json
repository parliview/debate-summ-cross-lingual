{"speaker": "Laima Liucija Andrikien\u0117 (PPE-DE).", "english": "Laima Liucija Andrikien\u0117 (PPE-DE). \u2013 (LT) First of all, I would like to thank Mr Brok for his very constructive and logical report. I am sure that if the European Union was able to formulate its position on all matters in this way, it would certainly be better supported and understood by its citizens. I would like to speak about the section of the report which talks about Turkey. I entirely agree that the European Union's expansion strategy has undoubtedly encouraged democratic, political and other reforms in Turkey and the other states mentioned in the resolution. However, it is equally important to note that, and I quote, \u2018while a political transition process is still underway in Turkey, in 2005 the pace of reforms has slowed and the implementation of reforms remains uneven\u2019. This is the exact reply I received yesterday from Commissioner Rehn to my verbal question on the implementation of the European Parliament's resolution on the start of negotiations with Turkey. This is also indicated in the draft resolution we have debated today, that is, that the pace of reforms in Turkey in 2005 was not only insufficient, but it actually has slowed down. This may be interpreted as Turkey's unpreparedness to carry out reforms which would bring it closer to the European Union, or perhaps even as an unwillingness to commit itself to the elementary obligations of possible membership.\nI also share the regret expressed in Mr Brok's report and in the resolution over the unilateral declaration made by Turkey when signing the Additional Protocol to the Ankara Agreement. I believe that it is necessary to remind Turkey that recognition of all European Union Member States is an indispensable component of the accession process.\nTrue, what I am about to say is not in the report, but I am sure that the acts of genocide committed against the Armenian nation 90 years ago should be recognised by Turkey at the highest level, as this more than any other action would bear testimony to the fact that Turkey's position, even regarding these painful events of the past, is in tune with the spirit of the Copenhagen criteria.", "lang": "LT", "original": "Laima Liucija Andrikien\u0117 (PPE-DE). \u2013 Pirmiausia nor\u0117\u010diau pad\u0117koti E. Brok u\u017e labai konstruktyv\u0173 ir logi\u0161k\u0105 prane\u0161im\u0105. Esu tikra, kad jei Europos S\u0105junga visais klausimais sugeb\u0117t\u0173 taip formuluoti savo pozicijas, ji tikrai tur\u0117t\u0173 daugiau pilie\u010di\u0173 paramos ir supratimo. Kalb\u0117siu d\u0117l prane\u0161imo dalies, kurioje kalbama apie Turkij\u0105. Visi\u0161kai pritariu, kad Europos S\u0105jungos pl\u0117tros strategija neabejotinai paskatino demokratines, politines ir kitas reformas Turkijoje bei kitose rezoliucijoje minimose valstyb\u0117se.

Tai galima b\u016bti interpretuoti kaip Turkijos nepasirengim\u0105 vykdyti reformas, kurios j\u0105 priartint\u0173 prie Europos S\u0105jungos, o gal net kaip nenor\u0105 prisiimti pradinius galimos naryst\u0117s \u012fsipareigojimus.\nVisi\u0161kai pritariu E.
