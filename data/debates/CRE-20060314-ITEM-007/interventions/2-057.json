{"speaker": "Sarah Ludford,", "english": "Sarah Ludford, on behalf of the ALDE Group . \u2013 Mr President, the strength of one\u2019s commitment to gender equality should not be measured by support for the establishment of a Gender Institute. The rapporteurs explain that they support that body: \u2018since it ensures that the overarching objective of gender equality ... will not be second to any other anti-discrimination policy at EU level\u2019. This misconceived objective explains why a separate institute is in fact a bad idea. There is no hierarchy of oppression. The promoters see it as more important to have the kudos of an exclusive body than the reality of an across-the-board transformation of society.\nThe Gender Institute should in fact be part of the new EU Agency on Fundamental Rights, just as the Anti-Racism Monitoring Centre will be. If gender is the only equality objective that stays outside the Fundamental Rights Agency, that will create an unbalanced model as well as weakening the latter agency. It may also ensure that gender equality becomes an isolated backwater rather than the highly visible flag-carrier that its supporters want.\nIt seems to me quite defensive to say that you need a separate institute to ensure that gender equality remains high on the EU political agenda. On the contrary, women can spearhead the campaign for equality in human rights for all through the Fundamental Rights Agency. That is the opinion of the UK\u2019s Equal Opportunities Commission and I endorse that.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Sarah Ludford, on behalf of the ALDE Group . \u2013 Mr President, the strength of one\u2019s commitment to gender equality should not be measured by support for the establishment of a Gender Institute.
