It constitutes a defining principle of Europe\u2019s economic, social and political life.

There are still major obstacles in the way of this social aim.\nLadies and gentlemen, if we fail to exploit the potential offered by women, we will not achieve the Lisbon objectives, and moreover we will be unable to compete on a global level. Gender equality, besides its underlying political aspects, constitutes a key competitive factor for us in the fierce arena of global competition. In the interests of eliminating all remaining inequality between men and women, it is now a priority of the first order to redouble efforts at Union and Member State levels, paying regard particularly to the increased heterogeneity of the enlarged Union. For these reasons, the creation of an instrument operating at a European level has since 1999 been viewed as essential. The European Council, in June 2004, therefore called on the Commission to submit a proposal. The Commission submitted the proposal to set up an institution which would be a technical instrument assisting European bodies and especially the Commission in developing policies and in guiding Member States on their implementation. The priority task will be to gather, analyse and distribute objective, reliable and comparable data within a Community setting. The institute will also develop appropriate methodological resources, aimed especially at incorporating a gender perspective into Community policies.

We agreed on compromises and jointly tabled a series of amendments generally aimed at slimming down the administration and ensuring the primacy of policy-making. We want to avoid duplication and prevent overlaps with other agencies. We want to ensure that all the expertise on equality issues that is to be found in the national institutes \u2013 the gender experts, the universities, the non-governmental organisations \u2013 can be drawn together into one network. We have proposed additions to the Commission proposal with the intention of involving civil society in an advisory role.\nThe Gender Institute will have a very important role to play in ensuring that we, as political decision-makers, can speedily draw on the results of gender research and thereby improve the lawmaking process. It is intended that the Institute should be a centre of excellence, and independent, although it will, of course, follow the guidelines set by the European Union and by our policies. It will be a milestone, and will have an effect far beyond the borders of the European Union, but there is a risk that people will say \u2013 as some Members of this House are already doing \u2013 that we do not want an institute specifically for gender issues, but that it should, instead, be combined with the Human Rights Agency.\nThe great danger of that, I think, would be that it would no longer be ensured that the European Union\u2019s programmes were visible to the public. As with the equality programme, what is needed is an instrument with an outward effect. I do not believe that PROGRESS has enabled us to ensure visibility, and we must have the certainty that the Equality Institute will do that. What is needed is a small, high-class institute that works to powerful effect.\nSaying \u2018no\u2019 to it today would be a major setback to the European Union\u2019s equality policy, and a major setback too to the equality roadmap that was so convincingly presented last week. It was Mr Barroso, the President of the Commission, who set out the timetable last week.

The work continued for five years, and debate was thorough; in 2000 the European Council of Nice acknowledged the need for a tool to promote the exchange of experience and for sharing information on equality between men and women.\nThe European Commission prepared a feasibility study and presented it, and one year ago, on 8\u00a0March, this decision was taken. It has already been said that this study was a joint and very significant effort by our Parliamentary committee, which took action to ensure that the institute becomes what we all wanted to see: a very flexible technical instrument, with the task of collating all the data supplied by statistical bodies and of disseminating this information in order to give all operators and all those responsible for legislating and taking action the opportunity to make choices that take into account the gender viewpoint.\nSome people will wonder whether a gender institute is really necessary. I definitely believe that it is, and this is confirmed by data available to all. As an example, the European directive on equal pay was adopted thirty years ago, in 1975, but today in Europe we still have an average inequality of 15%, while in some countries the figure is very close to 30%.\nEmployment data also tell a story: Lisbon will only become a reality if increasing numbers of women have access to the employment market, not to mention the problems of a fall in the birth-rate and violence.\nIn my view there is a need for this institute; we still require an institute of gender for women, aimed at women. The structure will be highly consolidated: there will be nine members of the governing board, plus a representative from the Commission and a representative for every country in the consultative committee.\nI would like to end by saying that the opposing positions are of two kinds: some people want to merge everything into an institute for human rights, and there are already plans to set this up in Vienna. If I wished to assist Commissioner Frattini I would agree, but I believe that this is not what women need. Others believe that it would cost too much, but my reply to that is that in Europe we have four bodies working on employment and they cost EUR\u00a066 million a year; this body, on the other hand, will only cost EUR\u00a08 million.", "lang": "IT", "original": "Amalia Sartori (PPE-DE), relatrice . \u2013 Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, aggiungo la mia voce a quella della collega Lissy Gr\u00f6ner per sostenere un voto a questa proposta della Commissione che risponde a un\u2019esigenza sentita in tutti i paesi europei, non solo dalle donne.\nIn realt\u00e0, come \u00e8 gi\u00e0 stato spiegato sia dal Commissario sia dalla collega Gr\u00f6ner, della questione si parla da molto tempo: l\u2019idea di creare un istituto del genere risale a pi\u00f9 di dieci anni fa, sull\u2019impulso dell\u2019allora ministro svedese per le Pari opportunit\u00e0. Il lavoro \u00e8 continuato per cinque anni, il dibattito \u00e8 stato approfondito, tanto che nel 2000 il Consiglio europeo di Nizza aveva riconosciuto la necessit\u00e0 di uno strumento per stimolare lo scambio di esperienze e condividere assieme le informazioni in materia di parit\u00e0 fra uomo e donna.\nLa Commissione europea ha elaborato uno studio di fattibilit\u00e0, lo ha poi presentato e un anno fa, l\u20198 marzo, \u00e8 stata presa questa decisione. Tale studio \u00e8 gi\u00e0 stato indicato come un lavoro congiunto e molto importante della nostra commissione parlamentare, la quale \u00e8 intervenuta affinch\u00e9 l\u2019istituto divenisse quello che tutti noi volevamo: uno strumento tecnico molto agile, con il compito di raccordare fra di loro tutti i dati forniti dagli istituti statistici e diffondere tali conoscenze per dare a tutti gli operatori e a tutti coloro che sono chiamati a legiferare e a operare la possibilit\u00e0 di poter fare scelte rispettose di un\u2019ottica di genere.\nQualcuno si chieder\u00e0: ma un istituto di genere \u00e8 proprio necessario? Credo proprio di s\u00ec e ce lo confermano i dati che sono sotto gli occhi di tutti. A titolo di esempio la direttiva europea sull\u2019uguaglianza di remunerazione \u00e8 stata adottata trenta anni fa, nel 1975, ma ancora oggi in Europa abbiamo una disuguaglianza media del 15 per cento, che in alcuni paesi sfiora il 30 per cento.\nContano anche i dati relativi all\u2019occupazione: Lisbona sar\u00e0 realizzata soltanto se sempre pi\u00f9 donne avranno accesso al mercato del lavoro. Per non parlare poi dei problemi della denatalit\u00e0 e della violenza.\nA mio parere esiste un bisogno di questo istituto, serve ancora un istituto di genere per le donne, rivolto alle donne. La struttura sar\u00e0 molto accorpata, ci saranno nove membri nel consiglio di amministrazione, pi\u00f9 un rappresentante della Commissione, e un rappresentante per ogni paese nel consiglio consultivo.\nConcludo dicendo che le posizioni contrarie sono di due tipi: alcuni vogliono accorpare tutto nell\u2019istituto per i diritti umani, la cui istituzione che \u00e8 gi\u00e0 prevista a Vienna. Se io volessi dare una mano al Commissario Frattini direi di s\u00ec, ma credo che le donne non abbiano bisogno di questo. Secondo altri costa troppo, ma allora dico che in Europa abbiamo quattro istituti che si occupano di lavoro e costano sessantasei milioni di euro all\u2019anno; questo ne coster\u00e0 invece solo otto.", "agenda_item": "European Institute for Gender Equality (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060314-ITEM-007", "intervention_id": "2-053", "summary_english": "{\n\"headline\": \"Strong Support for Gender Institute as Necessary Technical Tool Despite 30 Years of Persistent Pay Inequality\",\n\"issueSum\": \"The speaker addresses the establishment of a European gender institute, highlighting persistent gender inequalities including a 15% average pay gap across Europe (reaching 30% in some countries) despite equal pay directives from 1975, employment challenges affecting the Lisbon objectives, declining birth rates, and violence issues.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"The speaker strongly supports establishing the gender institute as a necessary and flexible technical instrument.

The planned Institute for Equality Issues can be that additional instrument, but, as we European parliamentarians \u2013 and we women in particular \u2013 want not only to work hard, but also to do so to lasting effect, the future gender institute must also have the right framework conditions in which to operate, and those include the funding available to it, with which it will have to manage.\nThere are two comments that the Committee on Budgets and its permanent rapporteur on agencies would like to make in this regard. Firstly, we already have 23 agencies, many of which are being set up or in the course of restructuring, and all of them need a lot of money. If our agreement with the Council on the next financial framework results in less money all round than this House has proposed, this will affect the decentralised agencies too.\nSecondly, the Commission has proposed \u2013 and to this proposal this House has not objected \u2013 that the Gender Institute should be fully financed through the Fifth Strand of PROGRESS. In June of last year, this House, in its position on the Financial Perspective, allocated over EUR\u00a0850 million to PROGRESS, but the Council, in December, cut almost 300 million from that amount. Without adequate funding, though, we will be unable to achieve any lasting effects where equality is concerned.

The user provided a debate summary about the European Institute for Gender Equality and wants the main points from Borut Pahor's speech. First, I need to check the debate summary to see what Borut Pahor said.\n\nLooking at the summary, under the \"Geographic Competition and New Member State Priority\" section, it mentions that multiple speakers from new member states advocated for hosting the institute. Specifically, Borut Pahor proposed Slovenia. The key points here are that he's from a new member state and is pushing for Slovenia to host the institute. \n\nThe user's instructions say to only include points attributed to the speaker. So, I need to make sure not to include other speakers' arguments. The issue here is the location of the institute, with a focus on new member states. His position is supporting Slovenia as the host. The argument is likely about decentralizing EU institutions to newer member states where discrimination issues are more prevalent, as mentioned by Lidia Joanna Geringer de Oedenberg. However, the summary doesn't explicitly state his reasoning, just that he proposed Slovenia. \n\nThe propSum would be his proposal for Slovenia to host. The issueSum would be the competition for hosting the institute among new member states. The positionSum is his support for Slovenia hosting. The argSum might be inferred as addressing discrimination in new member states, but since the summary doesn't explicitly state his arguments, maybe it's better to stick to what's given. \n\nWait, the user said if there's no points, return empty. But here, there's at least the proposal. So, the response should include issueSum about the geographic competition, positionSum about advocating for Slovenia, and propSum about proposing Slovenia. The argSum might be empty if there's no explicit argument, but the summary mentions that speakers from new member states argued for hosting, possibly citing discrimination issues. However, the specific arguments from Pahor aren't detailed. So maybe the argSum is not present. \n\nSo, structuring the JSON with the available info. Make sure not to include other speakers' points. The answer should be:\n\nissueSum: Geographic competition for hosting the institute, with a focus on new member states.\npositionSum: Advocated for Slovenia to host the European Institute for Gender Equality.\npropSum: Proposed Slovenia as the host country for the institute.\nargSum: Possibly not present, as the summary doesn't detail his specific arguments beyond the proposal.\n\nBut the user's example includes argSum even if brief. Since the summary mentions that speakers from new member states argued about decentralizing institutions where discrimination is more prevalent, maybe that's the argument. However, the exact words are from Lidia Joanna Geringer de Oedenberg. So, unless Pahor's argument is explicitly stated, I shouldn't include it. The summary only states that Pahor \"proposing Slovenia\" without his reasoning. Therefore, argSum might be empty. But the user's example includes an argument even if it's just the reason. Hmm.\n\nIn the example given, the argSum is \"His support for strict limitations on government demands for private data is based on a need to prevent improper use.\" So, even if the reasoning is inferred, it's included. But in this case, the summary doesn't state Pahor's reasoning. So maybe argSum is empty. But the user's instruction says to include arguments used to justify positions. Since the position is advocating for Slovenia, maybe the argument is related to decentralization or addressing discrimination in new member states. However, since the summary attributes that reasoning to Lidia Joanna Geringer de Oedenberg, not Pahor, I shouldn't include it. Therefore, argSum would be empty.\n\nSo the final JSON would have issueSum, positionSum, propSum, and argSum as empty. But the user's example has all four fields. Wait, the user's example has all four, but in this case, maybe some are empty. Let me check the original instructions again.\n\nThe user says: \"You will outline the main points or arguments made by that speaker. Your job is not to summarise the debate. Contributions or arguments from other speakers should not be included in your response. You will only include the points that are attributed to the speaker you are asked about. There may be no points or arguments attributed to the speaker. If this is the case, respond with an empty string.\"\n\nSo, if there are no points, return empty. But here, there are points. So, for Borut Pahor, the issue is the geographic competition. His position is supporting Slovenia. The proposal is to host in Slovenia. The argument might be that new member states need the institute, but since the summary doesn't explicitly state his argument, maybe argSum is empty. But the user might expect that the argument is related to the points mentioned in the summary. However, without explicit attribution, it's safer to leave it out.\n\nTherefore, the JSON would be:\n\n{\n  \"issueSum\": \"The key issue raised by the speaker relates to the geographic competition for hosting the European Institute for Gender Equality, advocating for new member states.\",\n  \"positionSum\": \"He supports the idea of hosting the institute in Slovenia, a new member state.\",\n  \"argSum\": \"\",\n  \"propSum\": \"He proposed Slovenia as the host country for the European Institute for Gender Equality.\"\n}\n\nBut the user's example has \"argSum\" even if brief. However, since there's no explicit argument from Pahor, maybe it's better to leave it empty. Alternatively, if the argument is implied, but not stated, then it's better to omit. So the final answer would have issueSum, positionSum, propSum, and argSum as empty.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The key issue raised by the speaker relates to the geographic competition for hosting the European Institute for Gender Equality, advocating for new member states.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"He supports the idea of hosting the institute in Slovenia, a new member state.\",\n\"argSum\": \"\",\n\"propSum\": \"He proposed Slovenia as the host country for the European Institute for Gender Equality.\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Anna Z\u00e1borsk\u00e1,", "english": "Anna Z\u00e1borsk\u00e1, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . \u2013 (FR) Mr\u00a0President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my deep gratitude to Mrs\u00a0Gr\u00f6ner and Mrs\u00a0Sartori for their excellent teamwork within the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality.\nLet me take the liberty of asking an iconoclastic question: could we do without a monitoring centre dealing exclusively with the differences in the treatment of men and women?\nThirty years on, despite all of our European directives, the continuing lack of equality in the treatment of men and women in all economic activities is an insult to our democracy.

Why do we need one? We need one because gender equality is the distinguishing feature of the European Union, for the European Union has said that we see equality as one of the European Union\u2019s values, and because we know that women are still being discriminated against. Contrary to what Mrs Ludford has just said, we are not talking here only about violations of human rights. This discrimination is going on in the labour market, in sport, and in many other areas. We know that women have a part to play in shaping the future, not only in terms of their potential in the Lisbon process, but also, for example, in terms of demography, where their role is positively crucial. Mothers, in particular, have a central role to play as regards the violations of the rights of women migrants. Yesterday, we heard from Commissioner Frattini how we still have too few statistics on forced prostitution. This European Gender Institute is what we need.\nIn the past, the European Union was a beacon of equality policy.

It is for these reasons that I urge the House to vote in large numbers in favour of this Equality Institute. It needs to be made visible in this way.\nThe Gender Institute is not, however, a substitute for legislative initiative. We will be vigilant in ensuring that equality policy does not run into the sand. The Gender Institute must not be allowed to become a means of appeasement or of distraction from the lack of legislative action. A Gender Institute will not make equality policy any less necessary a component in legislation, and we really will hold the Commission to that.\nSo let me again ask for really strong support for this report.", "lang": "DE", "original": "Hiltrud Breyer, im Namen der Verts/ALE-Fraktion . \u2013 Herr Pr\u00e4sident!

Her argument was about redirecting the \u20ac50 million budget to address poverty, stating that almost 70 million people in the EU live in poverty and need help. \n\nSo, the key points here are her opposition to the institute's funding, her argument that resources should be prioritized towards poverty alleviation instead, and her mention of the number of people in poverty. \n\nNow, I need to structure this into the JSON format as specified. The \"issueSum\" should outline the main issue she raised, which is the allocation of funds. \"positionSum\" would be her position of redirecting the budget.

I\u00a0admire and appreciate their work on this report, and in particular their patient awareness-raising campaign advocating the setting up of the Institute as a coordinator whose task will be to provide technical support for EU gender policy implementation, stimulating and acting in partnership with existing institutions, disseminating information and enhancing the visibility of issues relating to gender equality.\nI do not support the amendment suggesting that the Institute be integrated into the EU\u2019s Human Rights Agency based in Vienna, as the entire problem area would then become part of an existing agenda, and this would certainly not fulfil the EU\u2019s ambition to strengthen its equal opportunities policy. As the most recent reports also suggest, inequalities between men and women still persist. The existence of inequality is a matter for society as a whole and not just for women. Establishing the Institute will be a major building block for the recently adopted roadmap on implementing equal opportunity policy. In financial terms, the Institute will not be a\u00a0significant burden, as funding will come from sources that are already in place. The added value of the Institute will also include activities targeted outside the European Union, especially with regard to enlargement, where equal opportunities are, and will remain, a topical agenda.\nIn conclusion, I am convinced that locating the Institute in one of the new Member States will further the cause of even-handed institutional decentralisation in the European Union.", "lang": "SK", "original": "Zita Ple\u0161tinsk\u00e1 (PPE-DE). \u2013 V\u00e1\u017een\u00e9 d\u00e1my a p\u00e1ni.

The user provided a parliamentary debate summary about the European Institute for Gender Equality and wants the main points from Zita Ple\u0161tinsk\u00e1's speech.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the debate summary and find any mentions of Zita Ple\u0161tinsk\u00e1. Scanning through the sections, there's a part under \"Institutional Design Debates\" where she's mentioned. The summary says she argued that integrating the institute with existing structures would reduce gender equality to a partial agenda. \n\nSo, her main point is against integrating the institute with the Fundamental Rights Agency. The issue here is the institutional design\u2014whether the new institute should be independent or part of existing bodies. Her position is that integration would limit the scope of gender equality efforts. The argument is that having it as a separate entity ensures it's not just a part of a larger agenda. There's no mention of proposals beyond her argument against integration. \n\nI need to structure this into the JSON fields. The issue summary should mention the debate over independence vs. integration. Position summary states her opposition to integration. The argument is that integration would make gender equality a partial agenda. There's no specific proposal mentioned except her stance against integration. So propSum would be about maintaining independence. \n\nWait, the example response has \"propSum\" as a proposal. But in her case, she's opposing integration, which is a position rather than a proposal. The user's instructions say to include proposals or policy actions. Since she didn't suggest a specific policy but argued against integration, maybe propSum is empty. But the example includes \"advocates for strict limitations\" as a proposal. So maybe here, her argument is a proposal to keep it independent. But the summary doesn't mention a specific proposal, just her position. So perhaps propSum is empty. \n\nDouble-checking the debate summary: \"Zita Ple\u0161tinsk\u00e1, who argued that integration 'would reduce gender equality to a partial agenda.'\" So her argument is against integration, but there's no mention of a specific proposal. Therefore, propSum might be empty. But the user's example includes a proposal even if it's a position. Maybe in this case, the propSum would be her position of keeping the institute independent. But the instructions say to only include points attributed to the speaker. Since she didn't propose a specific policy, just stated her position, maybe propSum is empty. \n\nSo the final JSON would have issueSum about institutional independence vs. integration, positionSum her opposition to integration, argSum her reasoning, and propSum empty.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The institutional design of the European Institute for Gender Equality, specifically the debate over its independence versus integration with existing structures.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"Zita Ple\u0161tinsk\u00e1 opposed the integration of the European Institute for Gender Equality with the Fundamental Rights Agency, advocating for its independence.\",\n\"argSum\": \"She argued that integrating the institute into existing structures would reduce gender equality to a 'partial agenda,' undermining its comprehensive focus.\",\n\"propSum\": \"\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Teresa Riera Madurell (PSE).", "english": "Teresa Riera Madurell (PSE). \u2013 (ES) Mr President, I would like first of all to congratulate the rapporteurs on their report and express my satisfaction with the Commission\u2019s efforts to provide the European Union with an independent body specifically dedicated to gender equality issues.\nI would like to emphasise the need for the Institute to have full independence, without conditions of any kind.

The user provided a parliamentary debate summary about the European Institute for Gender Equality and wants the main points from Lidia Joanna Geringer de Oedenberg's speech.\n\nFirst, I need to locate where she's mentioned in the summary. Scanning through the debate summary, under the section \"Geographic Competition and New Member State Priority,\" there's a mention of her. She says, \"discrimination problems are not only widespread but often trivialized by authorities.\"\n\nSo, the key issue here is the prevalence and underestimation of discrimination in new member states. Her position is that these countries have significant discrimination issues that aren't taken seriously. The argument is that existing mechanisms aren't sufficient, which ties into the broader debate about the need for the institute. However, the user's example response includes \"issueSum,\" \"positionSum,\" \"argSum,\" and \"propSum.\" \n\nWait, the user's example has \"issueSum\" as the key issue, \"positionSum\" as the speaker's stance, \"argSum\" as the reasoning, and \"propSum\" as proposals. But in the debate summary, Lidia's contribution is about highlighting the problem in new member states. There's no mention of her proposing specific policies, just pointing out the issue. \n\nSo, \"issueSum\" would be the discrimination problems in new member states. \"positionSum\" is her assertion that these problems are widespread and trivialized. The argument is that existing mechanisms are insufficient, as mentioned in the conclusion. However, the user's example has \"argSum\" as the reasoning behind the position. But in the debate summary, her statement is a fact-based claim, not an argument. The actual arguments from her might be the evidence she provides, but the summary doesn't specify. \n\nWait, the user's instruction says to only include points attributed to the speaker. The summary says she noted that discrimination problems are widespread and trivialized. So, the issue is the discrimination in new member states. Her position is that these issues are not taken seriously. The argument is that existing mechanisms are insufficient, but that's from the conclusion, not her direct statement. However, the user's example includes \"argSum\" as the reasoning. But in her case, the summary doesn't provide arguments, just a statement. So maybe the argSum is that the problems are widespread and trivialized. But the example has \"argSum\" as the reasoning for the position. \n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let me check the exact text. The user's example has \"argSum\" as \"His support for strict limitations... is based on a need to prevent improper use.\" So, the argument is the reasoning. In Lidia's case, her position is that discrimination is widespread and trivialized. The argument would be that this is the case, but the summary doesn't provide her reasoning, just her statement. So maybe the argSum is that she points out the prevalence and trivialization. However, the user's example has \"argSum\" as the justification for the position. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"issueSum\" is the problem of discrimination in new member states, \"positionSum\" is her assertion that it's widespread and trivialized, \"argSum\" is the evidence from the debate (like the mention of existing directives not working), but the user's instruction says to only include what's attributed to the speaker. Since the summary doesn't have her providing arguments, only stating the fact, perhaps the argSum is empty. But the example includes an argSum. \n\nWait, the user's example has \"argSum\" as the arguments used to justify the positions. So if the speaker's position is that they support something, the argument is why. But in this case, Lidia's position is that discrimination is a problem in new member states. The argument would be that existing mechanisms aren't sufficient, but that's from the conclusion. However, the user's instruction says to only include points from the speaker. Since the summary doesn't have her providing arguments, only stating the issue, maybe the argSum is empty. But the example includes an argSum. \n\nThis is tricky. The user's example has \"argSum\" as the reasoning, but in this case, the speaker's statement is the position. So maybe:\n\nissueSum: Discrimination problems in new member states are widespread and often trivialized by authorities.\n\npositionSum: She highlights that discrimination issues in new member states are not adequately addressed.\n\nargSum: The evidence presented shows that existing mechanisms have failed to resolve these issues.\n\npropSum: Not mentioned, as she didn't propose specific policies, just pointed out the problem.\n\nBut the user's example includes propSum even if the speaker didn't make proposals. However, the user's instruction says to only include points attributed to the speaker. Since the summary doesn't mention any proposals from her, propSum would be empty.\n\nBut the user's example has propSum as \"He advocates for strict limitations...\" So in this case, if the speaker didn't make any proposals, propSum would be an empty string.\n\nSo finalizing:\n\nissueSum: The key issue is the prevalence of discrimination in new member states and its underestimation by authorities.\n\npositionSum: She emphasizes that discrimination problems in new member states are widespread and often trivialized.\n\nargSum: The argument is that existing mechanisms have proven insufficient to address these issues, as noted in the debate's conclusion.\n\npropSum: No proposals mentioned.\n\nBut wait, the user's example has \"argSum\" as the reasoning. However, the debate summary's conclusion mentions that existing mechanisms are insufficient, but that's not directly from her. So maybe the argSum is not present here. Therefore, the argSum would be an empty string. But the user's example includes it. \n\nAlternatively, since she states that discrimination is widespread and trivialized, that's her argument. So:\n\nargSum: She argues that discrimination is widespread and trivialized in new member states.\n\nBut the user's example has \"argSum\" as the justification for the position. So if her position is that discrimination is a problem, the argument is that it's widespread and trivialized. So:\n\nargSum: The argument is that discrimination problems are widespread and often trivialized by authorities in new member states.\n\nBut the user's example has \"argSum\" as the reasoning for the position, which in this case is her statement. So the JSON would be:\n\n{\n  \"issueSum\": \"Discrimination problems in new member states are widespread and often trivialized by authorities.\",\n  \"positionSum\": \"She highlights that discrimination issues in new member states are not adequately addressed.\",\n  \"argSum\": \"The argument is that discrimination is widespread and trivialized in new member states.\",\n  \"propSum\": \"\"\n}\n\nBut I need to make sure that all elements are based on her contributions. The summary says she \"noted that discrimination problems are not only widespread but often trivialized by authorities.\" So the issue is the existence of discrimination and its trivialization. Her position is that this is the case. The argument is that this is true.

The summary mentions that multiple speakers from new member states advocated for hosting the institute, and specifically notes Justas Vincas Paleckis advocating for Vilnius. \n\nSo, the key points here are that he is supporting Vilnius as the host city for the institute. The issue here is about the location of the institute, particularly in the context of new member states. His position is that the institute should be hosted in Vilnius. The argument he might be making is related to decentralizing EU institutions to newer member states where discrimination issues are more prevalent, as mentioned by Lidia Joanna Geringer de Oedenberg. However, the summary doesn't explicitly state his reasoning, just that he advocated for Vilnius. \n\nThe proposal would be that he wants the institute to be located in Vilnius. There's no mention of other proposals or arguments from him beyond that. The user's instructions say to only include points attributed to the speaker. Since the summary only mentions his advocacy for Vilnius, I need to structure the JSON accordingly. \n\nI need to make sure that the response doesn't include other speakers' points. For example, the summary mentions other new member state representatives, but the user is only asking about Paleckis. So, the issueSum would be about the location of the institute, his position is supporting Vilnius, the argument might be related to decentralization or addressing discrimination in new member states, but since the summary doesn't explicitly state his reasoning, I have to be careful not to assume. The propSum would be his proposal to host in Vilnius.\n\nWait, the user's example response includes arguments based on the speaker's statements. But in the provided debate summary, the only direct mention of Paleckis is that he \"advocated for Vilnius.\" There's no explicit argument or reasoning given for why he chose Vilnius. The summary does mention that speakers from new member states advocated for hosting, with reasons about decentralizing institutions and discrimination issues. But since the user says to only include points attributed to the speaker, and the summary doesn't attribute those reasons to Paleckis specifically, I can't include them. So, the argSum would be empty unless there's a direct statement.\n\nLooking back, the debate summary says: \"Multiple speakers from new member states advocated for hosting the institute, with Borut Pahor proposing Slovenia, Irena Belohorsk\u00e1 supporting Slovakia, and Justas Vincas Paleckis advocating for Vilnius.\" That's the only mention. So, the issue is the location of the institute. His position is supporting Vilnius. The argument isn't explicitly stated, so maybe argSum is empty. The proposal is to host in Vilnius.\n\nTherefore, the JSON should have:\n\nissueSum: \"The key issue raised by the speaker relates to the location of the European Institute for Gender Equality, advocating for Vilnius as the host city.\"\n\npositionSum: \"He supports the idea of hosting the European Institute for Gender Equality in Vilnius.\"\n\nargSum: \"The argument for this position is not explicitly detailed in the provided summary.\"\n\npropSum: \"He advocates for the European Institute for Gender Equality to be hosted in Vilnius.\"\n\nBut the user's example has more detailed arguments. However, since the summary doesn't provide explicit arguments from Paleckis, I can't infer them. So, the argSum would be empty or a summary of the reasons mentioned in the debate for new member states, but the user's instructions say not to include arguments from others. So, perhaps the argSum is empty. But the user's example includes \"His support for strict limitations...\" which is based on the speaker's reasoning. However, in this case, the summary doesn't provide Paleckis's reasoning, only his action. So, the argSum would be empty. But the user's example shows that if there's no argument, maybe it's an empty string.\n\nSo, the final JSON would have:\n\n{\n  \"issueSum\": \"The key issue raised by the speaker relates to the location of the European Institute for Gender Equality, advocating for Vilnius as the host city.\",\n  \"positionSum\": \"He supports the idea of hosting the European Institute for Gender Equality in Vilnius.\",\n  \"argSum\": \"\",\n  \"propSum\": \"He advocates for the European Institute for Gender Equality to be hosted in Vilnius.\"\n}\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The key issue raised by the speaker relates to the location of the European Institute for Gender Equality, advocating for Vilnius as the host city.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"He supports the idea of hosting the European Institute for Gender Equality in Vilnius.\",\n\"argSum\": \"\",\n\"propSum\": \"He advocates for the European Institute for Gender Equality to be hosted in Vilnius.\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Vladim\u00edr \u0160pidla,", "english": "Vladim\u00edr \u0160pidla, Member of the Commission . (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I have listened with great interest to your discussion and I hope you will allow me to touch on several of the issues that have been raised. First of all I would like to express my appreciation for the exceptional quality of the report by the rapporteurs, which can only be described as brilliant, in view of the complexity of the subject matter. Ladies and gentlemen, in the debate a number of arguments and opinions have been put forward, which in my view require a response.\nThe first opinion to be expressed was the view that this institution should become part of the human rights agenda. A series of speakers in the discussion have taken the view, which I fully support, that the question of equal opportunities goes far beyond the simple issue of human rights, albeit that human rights are of fundamental importance. The issue of equal opportunities is a broader issue.\nThere was a question as to whether it was right for the European Union to promote equal opportunities even in its international relations. I must state my firm conviction that there is a need for this. The EU is involved in countless international connections, both with the Member States and in the context of development aid and at a multilateral level, and each of these offers the opportunity of effectively reinforcing gender equality.\nLadies and gentlemen, I am convinced that gender equality, promoted and backed on a global scale, will provide a major source of global stability and is capable of pacifying many of our current conflicts. I also feel that the argument put forward in the debate that the institute will provide greater visibility and political transparency for the issues of equal rights and equal opportunities is correct. I fully support this argument. It is also right to remind ourselves, as was frequently stated in the debate, that we have much work still to do. Clearly, we are trying to define policies on the basis of argument, and that is one of the civilised outcomes of life in today\u2019s Europe. I might add that these are policies based on practical proofs and practical opinions. Even from this perspective the institute can enhance quality.\nIt is, in my view, apparent that there is a wealth of important information that is not being used effectively in political decision-making. Which of you, for example, knows that in Spain men spend 52 million hours a year taking care of others while for women the figure is 200\u00a0million hours. This is certainly an important indicator of how unequally we share some of the duties and responsibilities that we have as human beings \u2013 men and women. And yet none of this information feeds into political decision-making. I am convinced that the institute will make many things possible.\nLadies and gentlemen, one of the sound principles of European parliamentary life is multi-lingualism and we often discover that a given matter can be expressed more elegantly and accurately in some other European language. I hope you will therefore allow me to quote the German expression \u2018 Stillstand ist R\u00fcckschritt\u2019 . I am fully convinced that to stay where you are means in reality to retreat. Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to express an opinion on the amendments that are defined in the report, or which form part of your upcoming vote. The committee\u2019s attitude regarding the nature of the institute allows us to be flexible and to accept most of the amendments that strengthen the role and working methods of the institute, including the creation of the network for the institute. These amendments are acceptable in their original form, either in part or after reworking. The second category includes the amendments that increase the readability of the text and which the Commission equally can accept in their original form or after a small amount of reworking. The third group are the amendments that relate to the legal presentation techniques, which, although they are constructive, mark a departure from the original provisions of the existing instruments and therefore cannot be adopted, for reasons of maintaining cohesion. Finally there are the amendments that relate to horizontal questions, in other words to all agencies and organisations, in respect of procedures for selecting directors, extending their contracts and assessing organisations. These amendments cannot be accepted, because it is necessary to maintain a certain principle of cohesion in relation to all agencies.\nI have left to the end the question of the composition of the governing council. We are delighted that the Committee on Women\u2019s Rights and Gender Equality has come out in favour of limiting the number of members on the governing council and that it has followed the European Parliament resolution from December last year on an operational framework for future regulatory agencies. We can now be guided by this proposal, although the number of Commission representatives is not the same as in the case of the Council. The equilibrium between the two organisations and between the two levels of interest, which is to say the national level and the Community level, may be further secured if, in accordance with the proposal and where the Commission has responsibility, the voice of its representative carries the same weight as the voices of all of the Council representatives together, in the very limited number of cases involving the approval of budgets and programmes of work. We therefore accept Amendments 66, 82 and 85 relating to the composition of the governing council and voting regulations. In the same spirit we agree that the number of members can be reduced to a mere 25 representatives of the Member States, as stated in Amendments 67 and 83, and we consider it sufficient that participating parties are present at meetings of the governing council without voting rights. We hope that the Council will be able to adopt your proposal for the governing council, which, together with the rotating system, will allow representatives from all Member States to alternate over a period of three mandates.\nIn conclusion, I would like to say that we took pains to adopt as many of your amendments as possible. The Commission can now adopt Amendments 2 to 10, 13, 15, 17, 18, 20, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29, 35, 36, 38 to 42, 44, 45, 48, 53, 55, 59 to 69, 74 and 76 to 85.

We should also pay regard to the discussions in the Council, and we must take every effort to ensure that an acceptable compromise is achieved by the end of the year. The Commission is counting on the support of the European Parliament to set up this much needed European institute, and it is important to ensure that the organisation begins work in 2007, in the interests of progress and to raise the profile of the gender equality policy. I will of course be submitting an opinion on individual amendments in writing later.\n(Applause)", "lang": "EN", "original": "Vladim\u00edr \u0160pidla, Member of the Commission .

The user provided a debate summary about the European Institute for Gender Equality and wants the main points from Vladim\u00edr \u0160pidla's speech.\n\nFirst, I need to check the debate summary to find any mentions of \u0160pidla. Looking through the sections, under the \"Strong Majority Support with Varied Justifications\" part, there's a mention of Commissioner Vladim\u00edr \u0160pidla. His argument was about the institute being essential for European competitiveness, specifically that failing to exploit women's potential would hinder the Lisbon objectives and global competitiveness.\n\nNow, the user's instructions say to only include points attributed to the specified speaker. So I need to make sure not to include other speakers' points. The example response structure requires four fields: issueSum, positionSum, argSum, propSum.\n\nFor issueSum, the key issue here is the importance of the institute for competitiveness. PositionSum would be his support for the institute as essential. The argument is based on economic competitiveness and meeting Lisbon objectives. There's no mention of specific proposals beyond establishing the institute, so propSum might be about establishing it. Wait, but the example has propSum as advocating limitations. In this case, \u0160pidla's proposal is the establishment of the institute. But the user's example might have different elements. Let me check the exact quote again.\n\n\u0160pidla's quote: \"if we fail to exploit the potential offered by women, we will not achieve the Lisbon objectives, and moreover we will be unable to compete on a global level.\" So his argument is that the institute is necessary for competitiveness. The issue is the need for the institute to address gender equality for economic reasons. His position is that the institute is essential. The argument is tied to economic competitiveness and Lisbon objectives. The proposal would be establishing the institute. But the example response's propSum is about limitations, which is different. So in this case, the propSum would be supporting the establishment of the institute. However, the user's example might have different structures. Let me make sure.\n\nThe user's example has \"propSum\": \"He advocates for strict limitations on government demands for private data\". So in this case, \u0160pidla's propSum would be \"advocates for the establishment of the European Institute for Gender Equality to ensure competitiveness\". But the user's example might not have that. Wait, the user's example is about the Data Act, but here the debate is about the institute. So the propSum here would be the proposal to establish the institute. However, the user's instructions say to outline the main points or arguments made by the speaker. So \u0160pidla's main point is that the institute is essential for competitiveness. So the issue is the need for the institute to address gender equality for economic reasons. Position is supporting the institute. Argument is based on economic competitiveness. Proposal is the establishment of the institute. But the example response's propSum is a specific proposal, like limitations. So here, the propSum would be \"proposing the establishment of the European Institute for Gender Equality to enhance competitiveness\". But the user's example might have different phrasing. Let me structure it accordingly.\n\nSo, issueSum: The key issue is the necessity of the institute for European competitiveness. PositionSum: He supports the institute as essential for achieving competitiveness. ArgSum: His argument is based on the economic impact of not utilizing women's potential. PropSum: He proposes establishing the institute to address this.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The necessity of establishing the European Institute for Gender Equality to address economic competitiveness and achieve the Lisbon objectives.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"He supports the establishment of the European Institute for Gender Equality as essential for European competitiveness.\",\n\"argSum\": \"His argument is based on the economic imperative that failing to exploit women's potential would hinder the achievement of the Lisbon objectives and global competitiveness.\",\n\"propSum\": \"Proposes the establishment of the European Institute for Gender Equality to ensure the utilization of women's potential for economic growth and competitiveness.\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "President.", "english": "President. \u2013 The debate is closed.\nThe vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m.\nWritten Statements (Rule 142)", "lang": "EN", "original": "President. \u2013 The debate is closed.\nThe vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m.\nWritten Statements (Rule 142)", "agenda_item": "European Institute for Gender Equality (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060314-ITEM-007", "intervention_id": "2-074", "summary_english": "```json\n{\n  \"headline\": \"\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"\",\n  \"positionSum\": \"\",\n  \"argSum\": \"\",\n  \"propSum\": \"\",\n  \"quotes\": []\n}\n```", "summary_original": "```json\n{\n  \"headline\": \"\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"\",\n  \"positionSum\": \"\",\n  \"argSum\": \"\",\n  \"propSum\": \"\",\n  \"quotes\": []\n}\n```", "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "method": "structured", "formatted_summary": {"headline": "", "issueSum": "", "positionSum": "", "argSum": "", "propSum": "", "quotes": []}, "reconstructed_position": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query.

The user provided a parliamentary debate summary about the European Institute for Gender Equality and wants the main points from Katalin L\u00e9vai's speech.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the debate summary and find any mentions of Katalin L\u00e9vai. The summary mentions her in the context of emphasizing that the institute should transcend mere data collection. Specifically, she argued for making research results accessible to the public and establishing strong connections with civil society.\n\nSo, the key points here are her position that the institute needs to do more than collect data. Her argument is that active engagement with civil society and public access to research is necessary. The proposals she made include making research results accessible and building connections with civil society.\n\nI need to structure this into the four JSON fields: issueSum, positionSum, argSum, propSum. \n\nIssueSum should mention the institute's role beyond data collection. PositionSum states her stance on active policy role. ArgSum explains her reasoning, which is to ensure the institute's effectiveness. PropSum lists her proposals about accessibility and civil society connections.\n\nI need to make sure not to include other speakers' points. Check if there's anything else about her. The summary also mentions Hiltrud Breyer, but the user only wants Katalin L\u00e9vai's contributions. So the response should be focused solely on her arguments as per the provided summary.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The speaker emphasized the need for the European Institute for Gender Equality to move beyond data collection and actively engage with civil society.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"She advocated for the institute to play an active role in promoting gender equality through research and public engagement, rather than merely gathering data.\",\n\"argSum\": \"Her argument centered on ensuring the institute's research results are accessible to the public and that it establishes strong links with civil society to enhance its impact.\",\n\"propSum\": \"She proposed making research results accessible to the general public and fostering strong connections between the institute and civil society organizations.\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}]
