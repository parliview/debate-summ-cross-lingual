We agreed on compromises and jointly tabled a series of amendments generally aimed at slimming down the administration and ensuring the primacy of policy-making. We want to avoid duplication and prevent overlaps with other agencies. We want to ensure that all the expertise on equality issues that is to be found in the national institutes \u2013 the gender experts, the universities, the non-governmental organisations \u2013 can be drawn together into one network. We have proposed additions to the Commission proposal with the intention of involving civil society in an advisory role.\nThe Gender Institute will have a very important role to play in ensuring that we, as political decision-makers, can speedily draw on the results of gender research and thereby improve the lawmaking process. It is intended that the Institute should be a centre of excellence, and independent, although it will, of course, follow the guidelines set by the European Union and by our policies. It will be a milestone, and will have an effect far beyond the borders of the European Union, but there is a risk that people will say \u2013 as some Members of this House are already doing \u2013 that we do not want an institute specifically for gender issues, but that it should, instead, be combined with the Human Rights Agency.\nThe great danger of that, I think, would be that it would no longer be ensured that the European Union\u2019s programmes were visible to the public. As with the equality programme, what is needed is an instrument with an outward effect. I do not believe that PROGRESS has enabled us to ensure visibility, and we must have the certainty that the Equality Institute will do that.

The work continued for five years, and debate was thorough; in 2000 the European Council of Nice acknowledged the need for a tool to promote the exchange of experience and for sharing information on equality between men and women.\nThe European Commission prepared a feasibility study and presented it, and one year ago, on 8\u00a0March, this decision was taken. It has already been said that this study was a joint and very significant effort by our Parliamentary committee, which took action to ensure that the institute becomes what we all wanted to see: a very flexible technical instrument, with the task of collating all the data supplied by statistical bodies and of disseminating this information in order to give all operators and all those responsible for legislating and taking action the opportunity to make choices that take into account the gender viewpoint.\nSome people will wonder whether a gender institute is really necessary. I definitely believe that it is, and this is confirmed by data available to all. As an example, the European directive on equal pay was adopted thirty years ago, in 1975, but today in Europe we still have an average inequality of 15%, while in some countries the figure is very close to 30%.\nEmployment data also tell a story: Lisbon will only become a reality if increasing numbers of women have access to the employment market, not to mention the problems of a fall in the birth-rate and violence.\nIn my view there is a need for this institute; we still require an institute of gender for women, aimed at women. The structure will be highly consolidated: there will be nine members of the governing board, plus a representative from the Commission and a representative for every country in the consultative committee.\nI would like to end by saying that the opposing positions are of two kinds: some people want to merge everything into an institute for human rights, and there are already plans to set this up in Vienna. If I wished to assist Commissioner Frattini I would agree, but I believe that this is not what women need. Others believe that it would cost too much, but my reply to that is that in Europe we have four bodies working on employment and they cost EUR\u00a066 million a year; this body, on the other hand, will only cost EUR\u00a08 million.", "lang": "IT", "original": "Amalia Sartori (PPE-DE), relatrice . \u2013 Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, aggiungo la mia voce a quella della collega Lissy Gr\u00f6ner per sostenere un voto a questa proposta della Commissione che risponde a un\u2019esigenza sentita in tutti i paesi europei, non solo dalle donne.\nIn realt\u00e0, come \u00e8 gi\u00e0 stato spiegato sia dal Commissario sia dalla collega Gr\u00f6ner, della questione si parla da molto tempo: l\u2019idea di creare un istituto del genere risale a pi\u00f9 di dieci anni fa, sull\u2019impulso dell\u2019allora ministro svedese per le Pari opportunit\u00e0. Il lavoro \u00e8 continuato per cinque anni, il dibattito \u00e8 stato approfondito, tanto che nel 2000 il Consiglio europeo di Nizza aveva riconosciuto la necessit\u00e0 di uno strumento per stimolare lo scambio di esperienze e condividere assieme le informazioni in materia di parit\u00e0 fra uomo e donna.\nLa Commissione europea ha elaborato uno studio di fattibilit\u00e0, lo ha poi presentato e un anno fa, l\u20198 marzo, \u00e8 stata presa questa decisione. Tale studio \u00e8 gi\u00e0 stato indicato come un lavoro congiunto e molto importante della nostra commissione parlamentare, la quale \u00e8 intervenuta affinch\u00e9 l\u2019istituto divenisse quello che tutti noi volevamo: uno strumento tecnico molto agile, con il compito di raccordare fra di loro tutti i dati forniti dagli istituti statistici e diffondere tali conoscenze per dare a tutti gli operatori e a tutti coloro che sono chiamati a legiferare e a operare la possibilit\u00e0 di poter fare scelte rispettose di un\u2019ottica di genere.\nQualcuno si chieder\u00e0: ma un istituto di genere \u00e8 proprio necessario? Credo proprio di s\u00ec e ce lo confermano i dati che sono sotto gli occhi di tutti. A titolo di esempio la direttiva europea sull\u2019uguaglianza di remunerazione \u00e8 stata adottata trenta anni fa, nel 1975, ma ancora oggi in Europa abbiamo una disuguaglianza media del 15 per cento, che in alcuni paesi sfiora il 30 per cento.\nContano anche i dati relativi all\u2019occupazione: Lisbona sar\u00e0 realizzata soltanto se sempre pi\u00f9 donne avranno accesso al mercato del lavoro. Per non parlare poi dei problemi della denatalit\u00e0 e della violenza.\nA mio parere esiste un bisogno di questo istituto, serve ancora un istituto di genere per le donne, rivolto alle donne. La struttura sar\u00e0 molto accorpata, ci saranno nove membri nel consiglio di amministrazione, pi\u00f9 un rappresentante della Commissione, e un rappresentante per ogni paese nel consiglio consultivo.\nConcludo dicendo che le posizioni contrarie sono di due tipi: alcuni vogliono accorpare tutto nell\u2019istituto per i diritti umani, la cui istituzione che \u00e8 gi\u00e0 prevista a Vienna. Se io volessi dare una mano al Commissario Frattini direi di s\u00ec, ma credo che le donne non abbiano bisogno di questo. Secondo altri costa troppo, ma allora dico che in Europa abbiamo quattro istituti che si occupano di lavoro e costano sessantasei milioni di euro all\u2019anno; questo ne coster\u00e0 invece solo otto.", "agenda_item": "European Institute for Gender Equality (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060314-ITEM-007", "intervention_id": "2-053", "summary_english": "{\n\"headline\": \"Strong Support for Gender Institute as Necessary Technical Tool Despite 30 Years of Persistent Pay Inequality\",\n\"issueSum\": \"The speaker addresses the establishment of a European gender institute, highlighting persistent gender inequalities including a 15% average pay gap across Europe (reaching 30% in some countries) despite equal pay directives from 1975, employment challenges affecting the Lisbon objectives, declining birth rates, and violence issues.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"The speaker strongly supports establishing the gender institute as a necessary and flexible technical instrument.

The planned Institute for Equality Issues can be that additional instrument, but, as we European parliamentarians \u2013 and we women in particular \u2013 want not only to work hard, but also to do so to lasting effect, the future gender institute must also have the right framework conditions in which to operate, and those include the funding available to it, with which it will have to manage.\nThere are two comments that the Committee on Budgets and its permanent rapporteur on agencies would like to make in this regard. Firstly, we already have 23 agencies, many of which are being set up or in the course of restructuring, and all of them need a lot of money. If our agreement with the Council on the next financial framework results in less money all round than this House has proposed, this will affect the decentralised agencies too.\nSecondly, the Commission has proposed \u2013 and to this proposal this House has not objected \u2013 that the Gender Institute should be fully financed through the Fifth Strand of PROGRESS. In June of last year, this House, in its position on the Financial Perspective, allocated over EUR\u00a0850 million to PROGRESS, but the Council, in December, cut almost 300 million from that amount. Without adequate funding, though, we will be unable to achieve any lasting effects where equality is concerned.

Why do we need one? We need one because gender equality is the distinguishing feature of the European Union, for the European Union has said that we see equality as one of the European Union\u2019s values, and because we know that women are still being discriminated against. Contrary to what Mrs Ludford has just said, we are not talking here only about violations of human rights. This discrimination is going on in the labour market, in sport, and in many other areas. We know that women have a part to play in shaping the future, not only in terms of their potential in the Lisbon process, but also, for example, in terms of demography, where their role is positively crucial. Mothers, in particular, have a central role to play as regards the violations of the rights of women migrants. Yesterday, we heard from Commissioner Frattini how we still have too few statistics on forced prostitution. This European Gender Institute is what we need.\nIn the past, the European Union was a beacon of equality policy.

It is for these reasons that I urge the House to vote in large numbers in favour of this Equality Institute. It needs to be made visible in this way.\nThe Gender Institute is not, however, a substitute for legislative initiative. We will be vigilant in ensuring that equality policy does not run into the sand. The Gender Institute must not be allowed to become a means of appeasement or of distraction from the lack of legislative action. A Gender Institute will not make equality policy any less necessary a component in legislation, and we really will hold the Commission to that.\nSo let me again ask for really strong support for this report.", "lang": "DE", "original": "Hiltrud Breyer, im Namen der Verts/ALE-Fraktion . \u2013 Herr Pr\u00e4sident!

As the most recent reports also suggest, inequalities between men and women still persist. The existence of inequality is a matter for society as a whole and not just for women. Establishing the Institute will be a major building block for the recently adopted roadmap on implementing equal opportunity policy. In financial terms, the Institute will not be a\u00a0significant burden, as funding will come from sources that are already in place. The added value of the Institute will also include activities targeted outside the European Union, especially with regard to enlargement, where equal opportunities are, and will remain, a topical agenda.\nIn conclusion, I am convinced that locating the Institute in one of the new Member States will further the cause of even-handed institutional decentralisation in the European Union.", "lang": "SK", "original": "Zita Ple\u0161tinsk\u00e1 (PPE-DE). \u2013 V\u00e1\u017een\u00e9 d\u00e1my a p\u00e1ni.

The user provided a debate summary about the European Institute for Gender Equality and wants the main points from Zita Ple\u0161tinsk\u00e1 (PPE-DE). \n\nFirst, I need to find where she's mentioned. Scanning through the debate summary, under the \"Structural Debates\" section, there's a part about independence vs. integration. Zita Ple\u0161tinsk\u00e1 (PPE-DE) is cited as arguing against integrating the Institute with the Fundamental Rights Agency. Her reasoning was that integration would make gender equality part of an existing agenda rather than giving it proper focus.\n\nSo, the key issue here is the structure of the Institute. Her position is against integration with the Fundamental Rights Agency. The argument is that keeping it separate ensures it gets the necessary attention. There's no mention of proposals beyond her argument against integration. \n\nI need to structure this into the JSON fields. IssueSum should mention the structural debate on integration. PositionSum states her opposition to integration. ArgSum explains her reasoning about proper focus. PropSum would be her proposal to keep it independent. Wait, but the user said to only include points attributed to the speaker. The summary says she opposed integration, but does she propose an alternative? The original text says she argued against integration, but maybe her proposal is to keep it separate. However, the debate summary doesn't explicitly mention a proposal, just her opposition. So maybe propSum is empty? But the example includes a propSum even if it's just restating the position. Hmm.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says to outline the main points or arguments made by the speaker. The example includes \"propSum\" even if it's a position. But in this case, the speaker's argument is against integration, which is a position, not a proposal. The debate summary doesn't mention any specific proposal from her beyond that. So propSum might be empty. But the example has \"He advocates strict limitations...\" which is a proposal. Here, her argument is against integration, so maybe the propSum is \"advocates against integrating the Institute with the Fundamental Rights Agency\" but the user's example shows that propSum is about proposals. However, the user's instruction says to include proposals or policy actions. Since she didn't propose a specific policy action beyond opposing integration, maybe propSum is empty. But the example includes a propSum even if it's part of the position. I need to check the original instructions again.\n\nThe user says: \"propSum: A summary of any proposals or policy actions mentioned by the speaker to deal with the issues raised\". So if the speaker didn't mention a proposal, but only expressed a position, then propSum would be empty. In this case, Zita's contribution was opposing integration, but the debate summary doesn't mention any specific proposal from her. Therefore, propSum would be an empty string. However, the example given by the user includes a propSum even if it's part of the position. Wait, in the example, the propSum is \"He advocates for strict limitations...\" which is part of his position. But according to the user's instructions, propSum should be about proposals or policy actions. So maybe in this case, since she didn't propose a specific policy action beyond her argument, propSum is empty. \n\nSo, the JSON would be:\n\nissueSum: \"The structural debate on the Institute's integration with the Fundamental Rights Agency.\"\npositionSum: \"Opposed the integration of the Institute with the Fundamental Rights Agency, arguing it would dilute focus on gender equality.\"\nargSum: \"Argued that integration would make gender equality part of an existing agenda rather than giving it proper focus.\"\npropSum: \"\"\n\nBut the user's example includes a propSum even if it's part of the position. Maybe I need to check if there's any proposal. The original text says she \"argued that integration would make gender equality part of an existing agenda...\" which is an argument, not a proposal.

Nevertheless, we are in 2006 and many women still earn less than men for the same job or have contracts that do not correspond to the work that they are actually doing.\nThese effective measures, therefore, which are what women need in our European society, require that laws be put into practice and not that more and more laws be created. To this end, we need political will expressed through money, money that has to be provided for in the budgets, both national budgets and European Union budgets.\nI want genuine equality, and what, of course, I do not want is political propaganda. When governments that claim to be very progressive present plans such as, for example, the National Reform Plan that has been presented by the government of my country, they often include phrases such as \u2018benefits will be given for the contracting of young unemployed males of under thirty years of age\u2019 while at the same time not providing for any measure for women of under thirty years of age, amongst whom, in my country, there is a much higher rate of unemployment than amongst men.

(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I have listened with great interest to your discussion and I hope you will allow me to touch on several of the issues that have been raised. First of all I would like to express my appreciation for the exceptional quality of the report by the rapporteurs, which can only be described as brilliant, in view of the complexity of the subject matter. Ladies and gentlemen, in the debate a number of arguments and opinions have been put forward, which in my view require a response.\nThe first opinion to be expressed was the view that this institution should become part of the human rights agenda. A series of speakers in the discussion have taken the view, which I fully support, that the question of equal opportunities goes far beyond the simple issue of human rights, albeit that human rights are of fundamental importance. The issue of equal opportunities is a broader issue.\nThere was a question as to whether it was right for the European Union to promote equal opportunities even in its international relations. I must state my firm conviction that there is a need for this. The EU is involved in countless international connections, both with the Member States and in the context of development aid and at a multilateral level, and each of these offers the opportunity of effectively reinforcing gender equality.\nLadies and gentlemen, I am convinced that gender equality, promoted and backed on a global scale, will provide a major source of global stability and is capable of pacifying many of our current conflicts. I also feel that the argument put forward in the debate that the institute will provide greater visibility and political transparency for the issues of equal rights and equal opportunities is correct. I fully support this argument. It is also right to remind ourselves, as was frequently stated in the debate, that we have much work still to do. Clearly, we are trying to define policies on the basis of argument, and that is one of the civilised outcomes of life in today\u2019s Europe. I might add that these are policies based on practical proofs and practical opinions. Even from this perspective the institute can enhance quality.\nIt is, in my view, apparent that there is a wealth of important information that is not being used effectively in political decision-making. Which of you, for example, knows that in Spain men spend 52 million hours a year taking care of others while for women the figure is 200\u00a0million hours. This is certainly an important indicator of how unequally we share some of the duties and responsibilities that we have as human beings \u2013 men and women. And yet none of this information feeds into political decision-making. I am convinced that the institute will make many things possible.\nLadies and gentlemen, one of the sound principles of European parliamentary life is multi-lingualism and we often discover that a given matter can be expressed more elegantly and accurately in some other European language. I hope you will therefore allow me to quote the German expression \u2018 Stillstand ist R\u00fcckschritt\u2019 . I am fully convinced that to stay where you are means in reality to retreat. Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to express an opinion on the amendments that are defined in the report, or which form part of your upcoming vote. The committee\u2019s attitude regarding the nature of the institute allows us to be flexible and to accept most of the amendments that strengthen the role and working methods of the institute, including the creation of the network for the institute. These amendments are acceptable in their original form, either in part or after reworking. The second category includes the amendments that increase the readability of the text and which the Commission equally can accept in their original form or after a small amount of reworking. The third group are the amendments that relate to the legal presentation techniques, which, although they are constructive, mark a departure from the original provisions of the existing instruments and therefore cannot be adopted, for reasons of maintaining cohesion. Finally there are the amendments that relate to horizontal questions, in other words to all agencies and organisations, in respect of procedures for selecting directors, extending their contracts and assessing organisations. These amendments cannot be accepted, because it is necessary to maintain a certain principle of cohesion in relation to all agencies.\nI have left to the end the question of the composition of the governing council. We are delighted that the Committee on Women\u2019s Rights and Gender Equality has come out in favour of limiting the number of members on the governing council and that it has followed the European Parliament resolution from December last year on an operational framework for future regulatory agencies. We can now be guided by this proposal, although the number of Commission representatives is not the same as in the case of the Council. The equilibrium between the two organisations and between the two levels of interest, which is to say the national level and the Community level, may be further secured if, in accordance with the proposal and where the Commission has responsibility, the voice of its representative carries the same weight as the voices of all of the Council representatives together, in the very limited number of cases involving the approval of budgets and programmes of work. We therefore accept Amendments 66, 82 and 85 relating to the composition of the governing council and voting regulations. In the same spirit we agree that the number of members can be reduced to a mere 25 representatives of the Member States, as stated in Amendments 67 and 83, and we consider it sufficient that participating parties are present at meetings of the governing council without voting rights. We hope that the Council will be able to adopt your proposal for the governing council, which, together with the rotating system, will allow representatives from all Member States to alternate over a period of three mandates.\nIn conclusion, I would like to say that we took pains to adopt as many of your amendments as possible. The Commission can now adopt Amendments 2 to 10, 13, 15, 17, 18, 20, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29, 35, 36, 38 to 42, 44, 45, 48, 53, 55, 59 to 69, 74 and 76 to 85. The Commission cannot adopt Amendments 1, 11, 12, 14, 16, 19, 21 to 23, 27, 30 to 34, 37, 43, 46, 47, 49 to 52, 54, 56 to 58, 70 to 73 and part of 75. We should also pay regard to the discussions in the Council, and we must take every effort to ensure that an acceptable compromise is achieved by the end of the year. The Commission is counting on the support of the European Parliament to set up this much needed European institute, and it is important to ensure that the organisation begins work in 2007, in the interests of progress and to raise the profile of the gender equality policy. I will of course be submitting an opinion on individual amendments in writing later.\n(Applause)", "lang": "EN", "original": "Vladim\u00edr \u0160pidla, Member of the Commission .

The Commission can now adopt Amendments 2 to 10, 13, 15, 17, 18, 20, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29, 35, 36, 38 to 42, 44, 45, 48, 53, 55, 59 to 69, 74 and 76 to 85. The Commission cannot adopt Amendments 1, 11, 12, 14, 16, 19, 21 to 23, 27, 30 to 34, 37, 43, 46, 47, 49 to 52, 54, 56 to 58, 70 to 73 and part of 75. We should also pay regard to the discussions in the Council, and we must take every effort to ensure that an acceptable compromise is achieved by the end of the year. The Commission is counting on the support of the European Parliament to set up this much needed European institute, and it is important to ensure that the organisation begins work in 2007, in the interests of progress and to raise the profile of the gender equality policy. I will of course be submitting an opinion on individual amendments in writing later.\n(Applause)", "agenda_item": "European Institute for Gender Equality (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060314-ITEM-007", "intervention_id": "2-073", "summary_english": "{\n\"headline\": \"Commissioner Supports Gender Equality Institute with Practical Amendments and Global Perspective\",\n\"issueSum\": \"The speaker addresses the establishment of the European Institute for Gender Equality, discussing its scope beyond human rights to encompass broader equal opportunities issues.

In the Executive Summary section under \"Strong Support Coalition,\" it says that Commissioner Vladim\u00edr \u0160pidla framed gender equality as essential for EU competitiveness, arguing that failing to exploit women's potential would hinder the Lisbon objectives and global competitiveness. \n\nSo the issue here is the establishment of the Institute and its role in competitiveness. His position is that gender equality is crucial for the EU's competitiveness. The argument is tied to economic imperatives and the Lisbon objectives. There's no mention of specific proposals from him beyond his argument about competitiveness. \n\nI need to make sure I don't include other speakers' points.

The user provided a debate summary about the European Institute for Gender Equality and wants the main points from Katalin L\u00e9vai (PSE). \n\nFirst, I need to look through the debate summary and find any mentions of Katalin L\u00e9vai. Scanning through the sections, under \"Implementation Proposals,\" there's a mention of her. She is part of the PSE group. The summary says she emphasized public communication, stating that research results should be made available to the general public to enable European citizens to adopt a conscious position on gender equality issues.\n\nSo, the issue here is about making research results accessible. Her position is that the Institute should communicate findings to the public. The argument is that this helps citizens form informed opinions. The proposal is to ensure public access to research results.\n\nI need to structure this into the JSON fields. The issueSum should mention public access to research. PositionSum is about her emphasis on public communication. ArgSum is the reasoning behind it, which is to enable informed citizen positions. PropSum is the proposal to make results available.\n\nI need to make sure not to include other speakers' points. Check if there's anything else about her. The rest of the summary doesn't mention her again. So the response should be based solely on that one sentence. Avoid adding other points like funding or structure since those are from others.
