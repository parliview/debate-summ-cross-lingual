I am sure you will agree with me that gender equality is an economic just as much as a political goal, as well as being a fundamental building block of our democratic society. It constitutes a defining principle of Europe\u2019s economic, social and political life. The full participation of women, with completely equal opportunities and full participation in the workplace has become a key element of the European economy within a Union that has to cope with an aging population and demographic loss. The Commission\u2019s reports for the years 2005 and 2006 on gender equality show, however, that progress has been slow in this area. There are still major obstacles in the way of this social aim.\nLadies and gentlemen, if we fail to exploit the potential offered by women, we will not achieve the Lisbon objectives, and moreover we will be unable to compete on a global level. Gender equality, besides its underlying political aspects, constitutes a key competitive factor for us in the fierce arena of global competition. In the interests of eliminating all remaining inequality between men and women, it is now a priority of the first order to redouble efforts at Union and Member State levels, paying regard particularly to the increased heterogeneity of the enlarged Union. For these reasons, the creation of an instrument operating at a European level has since 1999 been viewed as essential. The European Council, in June 2004, therefore called on the Commission to submit a proposal. The Commission submitted the proposal to set up an institution which would be a technical instrument assisting European bodies and especially the Commission in developing policies and in guiding Member States on their implementation. The priority task will be to gather, analyse and distribute objective, reliable and comparable data within a Community setting. The institute will also develop appropriate methodological resources, aimed especially at incorporating a gender perspective into Community policies. Eventually, it will also contribute to the greater visibility of Community policy, which is particularly important at the present time and which is in principle also a building block of the democratic political process, as it is imperative that issues are there for all to see.

Let me start by reading through the debate summary carefully.\n\nFirst, the debate is about the establishment of a European Institute for Gender Equality. The summary mentions that there are 26 speakers, and the main topic is the report by Mrs. Lissy Gr\u00f6ner and Mrs. Amalia Sartori on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality.\n\nLooking at the section titled \"Strong Support Coalition,\" the first speaker mentioned is Commissioner Vladim\u00edr \u0160pidla. The summary says he positioned gender equality as both an economic necessity and a democratic imperative. His quote is: \"if we fail to exploit the potential offered by women, we will not achieve the Lisbon objectives, and moreover we will be unable to compete on a global level.\" He also emphasized the institute's role in gathering reliable data and providing technical support for policy development.\n\nThen, in the \"Commission Response\" section, it's mentioned that Commissioner \u0160pidla concluded by accepting most parliamentary amendments and emphasized urgency, saying the Commission is counting on the Parliament's support to set up the institute, and it's important to ensure the organization starts work in 2007. He also provided specific details on which of the 85 proposed amendments could be accepted while maintaining institutional coherence.\n\nSo, the user is asking for the main points attributed to Vladim\u00edr \u0160pidla. From the summary, his arguments are:\n\n1. Gender equality is an economic necessity and a democratic imperative.\n2. Failure to utilize women's potential would hinder the Lisbon objectives and global competitiveness.\n3. The institute's role is to gather reliable data and provide technical support for policy development.\n4. He accepted most amendments and emphasized the urgency of setting up the institute by 2007.\n5. He mentioned specific details about accepting amendments to maintain institutional coherence.\n\nI need to make sure I don't include arguments from other speakers. For example, the part about the Lisbon objectives and global competition is directly from \u0160pidla. The part about the institute's role in data and technical support is also his. The Commission response section mentions his acceptance of amendments and the urgency, which are his points. \n\nI should check if there are any other mentions of him. The summary also mentions that in the \"Commission Response\" section, he provided specific details on amendments. So that's another point. \n\nSo the main points are his arguments about the necessity of gender equality for economic and democratic reasons, the role of the institute, and his response regarding amendments and urgency. I need to present these clearly, without including other speakers' points.\n</think>\n\nVladim\u00edr \u0160pidla argued that gender equality is both an economic necessity and a democratic imperative, stating that failing to exploit women's potential would hinder the EU's ability to meet the Lisbon objectives and compete globally. He emphasized the European Institute for Gender Equality's role in gathering reliable data and providing technical support for policy development.

We agreed on compromises and jointly tabled a series of amendments generally aimed at slimming down the administration and ensuring the primacy of policy-making. We want to avoid duplication and prevent overlaps with other agencies. We want to ensure that all the expertise on equality issues that is to be found in the national institutes \u2013 the gender experts, the universities, the non-governmental organisations \u2013 can be drawn together into one network. We have proposed additions to the Commission proposal with the intention of involving civil society in an advisory role.\nThe Gender Institute will have a very important role to play in ensuring that we, as political decision-makers, can speedily draw on the results of gender research and thereby improve the lawmaking process. It is intended that the Institute should be a centre of excellence, and independent, although it will, of course, follow the guidelines set by the European Union and by our policies. It will be a milestone, and will have an effect far beyond the borders of the European Union, but there is a risk that people will say \u2013 as some Members of this House are already doing \u2013 that we do not want an institute specifically for gender issues, but that it should, instead, be combined with the Human Rights Agency.\nThe great danger of that, I think, would be that it would no longer be ensured that the European Union\u2019s programmes were visible to the public. As with the equality programme, what is needed is an instrument with an outward effect. I do not believe that PROGRESS has enabled us to ensure visibility, and we must have the certainty that the Equality Institute will do that. What is needed is a small, high-class institute that works to powerful effect.\nSaying \u2018no\u2019 to it today would be a major setback to the European Union\u2019s equality policy, and a major setback too to the equality roadmap that was so convincingly presented last week. It was Mr Barroso, the President of the Commission, who set out the timetable last week.

The work continued for five years, and debate was thorough; in 2000 the European Council of Nice acknowledged the need for a tool to promote the exchange of experience and for sharing information on equality between men and women.\nThe European Commission prepared a feasibility study and presented it, and one year ago, on 8\u00a0March, this decision was taken. It has already been said that this study was a joint and very significant effort by our Parliamentary committee, which took action to ensure that the institute becomes what we all wanted to see: a very flexible technical instrument, with the task of collating all the data supplied by statistical bodies and of disseminating this information in order to give all operators and all those responsible for legislating and taking action the opportunity to make choices that take into account the gender viewpoint.\nSome people will wonder whether a gender institute is really necessary. I definitely believe that it is, and this is confirmed by data available to all. As an example, the European directive on equal pay was adopted thirty years ago, in 1975, but today in Europe we still have an average inequality of 15%, while in some countries the figure is very close to 30%.\nEmployment data also tell a story: Lisbon will only become a reality if increasing numbers of women have access to the employment market, not to mention the problems of a fall in the birth-rate and violence.\nIn my view there is a need for this institute; we still require an institute of gender for women, aimed at women. The structure will be highly consolidated: there will be nine members of the governing board, plus a representative from the Commission and a representative for every country in the consultative committee.\nI would like to end by saying that the opposing positions are of two kinds: some people want to merge everything into an institute for human rights, and there are already plans to set this up in Vienna. If I wished to assist Commissioner Frattini I would agree, but I believe that this is not what women need. Others believe that it would cost too much, but my reply to that is that in Europe we have four bodies working on employment and they cost EUR\u00a066 million a year; this body, on the other hand, will only cost EUR\u00a08 million.", "lang": "IT", "original": "Amalia Sartori (PPE-DE), relatrice . \u2013 Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, aggiungo la mia voce a quella della collega Lissy Gr\u00f6ner per sostenere un voto a questa proposta della Commissione che risponde a un\u2019esigenza sentita in tutti i paesi europei, non solo dalle donne.\nIn realt\u00e0, come \u00e8 gi\u00e0 stato spiegato sia dal Commissario sia dalla collega Gr\u00f6ner, della questione si parla da molto tempo: l\u2019idea di creare un istituto del genere risale a pi\u00f9 di dieci anni fa, sull\u2019impulso dell\u2019allora ministro svedese per le Pari opportunit\u00e0.

Let me start by looking at the debate summary provided.\n\nFrom the summary, under the \"Strong Support Coalition\" section, it mentions that Co-rapporteur Amalia Sartori (PPE-DE) provided compelling evidence of persistent inequality. The exact quote given is: \"the European directive on equal pay was adopted thirty years ago, in 1975, but today in Europe we still have an average inequality of 15%, while in some countries the figure is very close to 30%\". \n\nSo, the main point here is that she highlighted the ongoing gender pay gap despite existing directives. She used specific statistics to emphasize that even after 30 years, there's still significant inequality. The summary doesn't mention any other arguments from her, just this one point about the pay gap. \n\nI should check if there are other mentions of her in other sections. Looking through the rest of the summary, there's a section on \"Key Areas of Consensus\" where Anna Z\u00e1borsk\u00e1, Teresa Riera Madurell, and Hiltrud Breyer are mentioned, but not Sartori. In the \"Opposition and Concerns\" section, Sarah Ludford and Urszula Krupa are mentioned, but again, not Sartori. The \"Structural and Operational Proposals\" section talks about Eva-Britt Svensson and others, but not Sartori. The \"Philosophical Opposition\" mentions Maciej Marian Giertych, and the Commission Response is about \u0160pidla. \n\nSo, based on the summary, the only contribution from Amalia Sartori is the statistic about the pay gap. The user's instruction says to only include points attributed to the speaker. Since the summary only attributes that one statement to her, that's the only point to include. There's no other information about her arguments in the provided debate summary. Therefore, the answer should be that one point about the 15% average inequality and some countries at 30%.\n</think>\n\nAmalia Sartori (PPE-DE) highlighted persistent gender inequality by citing that \"the European directive on equal pay was adopted thirty years ago, in 1975, but today in Europe we still have an average inequality of 15%, while in some countries the figure is very close to 30%.\" This argument underscored the ongoing need for institutional action to address systemic disparities.", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Jutta D.

The planned Institute for Equality Issues can be that additional instrument, but, as we European parliamentarians \u2013 and we women in particular \u2013 want not only to work hard, but also to do so to lasting effect, the future gender institute must also have the right framework conditions in which to operate, and those include the funding available to it, with which it will have to manage.\nThere are two comments that the Committee on Budgets and its permanent rapporteur on agencies would like to make in this regard. Firstly, we already have 23 agencies, many of which are being set up or in the course of restructuring, and all of them need a lot of money. If our agreement with the Council on the next financial framework results in less money all round than this House has proposed, this will affect the decentralised agencies too.\nSecondly, the Commission has proposed \u2013 and to this proposal this House has not objected \u2013 that the Gender Institute should be fully financed through the Fifth Strand of PROGRESS. In June of last year, this House, in its position on the Financial Perspective, allocated over EUR\u00a0850 million to PROGRESS, but the Council, in December, cut almost 300 million from that amount.

The summary is structured into different sections like Strong Support Coalition, Key Areas of Consensus, Opposition and Concerns, etc. \n\nLooking at the \"Opposition and Concerns\" section, there's a mention of Jutta D. Haug (PSE). The quote says: \"Jutta D. Haug (PSE) supported the institute but warned that 'without adequate funding, though, we will be unable to achieve any lasting effects where equality is concerned' [Haug, 2006-03-14].\" \n\nSo her main argument here is about the importance of adequate funding for the institute to have a lasting impact on equality. The summary doesn't mention any other points from her. The user specified to only include points attributed to the speaker, so I should focus solely on that quote. \n\nI need to make sure there are no other references to her in other sections. Scanning through the other parts of the summary, I don't see any other mentions of Jutta D. Haug. The rest of the sections talk about other speakers like \u0160pidla, Gr\u00f6ner, Sartori, etc. \n\nTherefore, the only point from Jutta D. Haug is her warning about the necessity of adequate funding. The answer should reflect that single argument without including anything else from other speakers.\n</think>\n\nJutta D. Haug (PSE) supported the establishment of the European Institute for Gender Equality but emphasized that \"without adequate funding, though, we will be unable to achieve any lasting effects where equality is concerned.\"", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Borut Pahor (PSE),", "english": "Borut Pahor (PSE), draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. \u2013 (SL) Before I offer a few thoughts of my own, I would like to express support for my colleague who spoke shortly before me about the importance of funding for the successful work of the institute.\nI speak as the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, and I wish to express my satisfaction regarding the proposal for the establishment of a European Institute for Gender Equality.

I hope that the institute will not be simply a passive statistical office there to measure equality or inequality, but will also be an active proponent of new strategies that will ensure actual progress in respect of equality.\nI cannot resist the temptation to tell this distinguished Chamber about Slovenia\u2019s candidacy to host the institute.

Let me look through the summary provided.\n\nThe user mentioned that the debate had 26 speakers, and the summary is divided into sections like Strong Support Coalition, Key Areas of Consensus, Opposition and Concerns, etc. The user is asking specifically about Sarah Ludford. \n\nLooking at the \"Opposition and Concerns\" section, there's a part about Sarah Ludford (ALDE). The summary says she opposed a standalone institute, arguing that \"the Gender Institute should in fact be part of the new EU Agency on Fundamental Rights\" because \"there is no hierarchy of oppression.\" \n\nSo her main point was against having a separate institute and instead suggested integrating it into another existing agency. The key argument here is about institutional integration. She believed that combining the institute with the Fundamental Rights Agency would be better, possibly to avoid duplication or to ensure a more cohesive approach. The phrase \"no hierarchy of oppression\" suggests she thought all forms of discrimination should be addressed together rather than having a specific institute for gender equality. \n\nI need to make sure there are no other points attributed to her. The summary doesn't mention any other contributions from Sarah Ludford. The rest of the sections mention other speakers, but for her, it's only that one point about integrating the institute into the Fundamental Rights Agency. \n\nSo the answer should list her argument about institutional integration, specifically her opposition to a standalone institute and her proposal to merge it with the new EU Agency on Fundamental Rights. No other points are mentioned for her in the summary.\n</think>\n\nSarah Ludford (ALDE) opposed the establishment of a standalone European Institute for Gender Equality, arguing that \"the Gender Institute should in fact be part of the new EU Agency on Fundamental Rights\" because \"there is no hierarchy of oppression.\" Her key concern was institutional integration, advocating for the institute to be incorporated into an existing agency focused on fundamental rights rather than creating a separate entity.", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Hiltrud Breyer,", "english": "Hiltrud Breyer, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . \u2013 (DE) Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance gives its wholehearted backing to an independent and effective gender institute, and endorses Mrs Gr\u00f6ner\u2019s and Mrs Sartori\u2019s report in its entirety.\nMany in this House ask why we need a new Institute. Why do we need one? We need one because gender equality is the distinguishing feature of the European Union, for the European Union has said that we see equality as one of the European Union\u2019s values, and because we know that women are still being discriminated against. Contrary to what Mrs Ludford has just said, we are not talking here only about violations of human rights. This discrimination is going on in the labour market, in sport, and in many other areas. We know that women have a part to play in shaping the future, not only in terms of their potential in the Lisbon process, but also, for example, in terms of demography, where their role is positively crucial. Mothers, in particular, have a central role to play as regards the violations of the rights of women migrants. Yesterday, we heard from Commissioner Frattini how we still have too few statistics on forced prostitution. This European Gender Institute is what we need.\nIn the past, the European Union was a beacon of equality policy. A \u2018no\u2019 vote would be a disaster; it would mean a real rupture in the European Union, and would amount to an admission by this House that its equality policy had nothing left to offer. It is for these reasons that I urge the House to vote in large numbers in favour of this Equality Institute. It needs to be made visible in this way.\nThe Gender Institute is not, however, a substitute for legislative initiative. We will be vigilant in ensuring that equality policy does not run into the sand. The Gender Institute must not be allowed to become a means of appeasement or of distraction from the lack of legislative action. A Gender Institute will not make equality policy any less necessary a component in legislation, and we really will hold the Commission to that.\nSo let me again ask for really strong support for this report.", "lang": "DE", "original": "Hiltrud Breyer, im Namen der Verts/ALE-Fraktion . \u2013 Herr Pr\u00e4sident!

I\u00a0admire and appreciate their work on this report, and in particular their patient awareness-raising campaign advocating the setting up of the Institute as a coordinator whose task will be to provide technical support for EU gender policy implementation, stimulating and acting in partnership with existing institutions, disseminating information and enhancing the visibility of issues relating to gender equality.\nI do not support the amendment suggesting that the Institute be integrated into the EU\u2019s Human Rights Agency based in Vienna, as the entire problem area would then become part of an existing agenda, and this would certainly not fulfil the EU\u2019s ambition to strengthen its equal opportunities policy. As the most recent reports also suggest, inequalities between men and women still persist. The existence of inequality is a matter for society as a whole and not just for women. Establishing the Institute will be a major building block for the recently adopted roadmap on implementing equal opportunity policy. In financial terms, the Institute will not be a\u00a0significant burden, as funding will come from sources that are already in place. The added value of the Institute will also include activities targeted outside the European Union, especially with regard to enlargement, where equal opportunities are, and will remain, a topical agenda.\nIn conclusion, I am convinced that locating the Institute in one of the new Member States will further the cause of even-handed institutional decentralisation in the European Union.", "lang": "SK", "original": "Zita Ple\u0161tinsk\u00e1 (PPE-DE). \u2013 V\u00e1\u017een\u00e9 d\u00e1my a p\u00e1ni.

Nevertheless, we are in 2006 and many women still earn less than men for the same job or have contracts that do not correspond to the work that they are actually doing.\nThese effective measures, therefore, which are what women need in our European society, require that laws be put into practice and not that more and more laws be created.

The summary includes contributions from various speakers, but the task is to extract only the points made by Justas Vincas Paleckis, who is part of the PSE group. \n\nLooking through the sections of the summary: \n\nUnder \"Strong Support Coalition,\" there are mentions of Commissioner \u0160pidla, Lissy Gr\u00f6ner, and Amalia Sartori. Then in \"Key Areas of Consensus,\" there are quotes from Anna Z\u00e1borsk\u00e1, Teresa Riera Madurell, and Hiltrud Breyer. In \"Opposition and Concerns,\" Sarah Ludford, Urszula Krupa, and Jutta D. Haug are mentioned. The \"Structural and Operational Proposals\" section includes Eva-Britt Svensson, Borut Pahor, Irena Belohorsk\u00e1, and Katalin L\u00e9vai. Then there's \"Philosophical Opposition\" with Maciej Marian Giertych, and the Commission Response by \u0160pidla. The conclusion wraps it up.\n\nNow, I need to check if Justas Vincas Paleckis is mentioned anywhere in the summary. The user's query specifies that if there are no points attributed to the speaker, I should return an empty string. \n\nLooking through each section again:\n\n- The \"Strong Support Coalition\" mentions Gr\u00f6ner and Sartori.\n- \"Key Areas of Consensus\" has Z\u00e1borsk\u00e1, Riera Madurell, Breyer.\n- \"Opposition and Concerns\" has Ludford, Krupa, Haug.\n- \"Structural and Operational Proposals\" includes Svensson, Pahor, Belohorsk\u00e1, L\u00e9vai.\n- \"Philosophical Opposition\" has Giertych.\n- Commission Response is \u0160pidla.\n\nWait, the name Justas Vincas Paleckis isn't mentioned anywhere in the summary. The speakers listed are others. The user's instruction says that if there are no points attributed to the speaker, respond with an empty string. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be an empty string because the summary doesn't attribute any statements to Justas Vincas Paleckis. Maybe the user made a typo or included a speaker not present in the summary. But based on the given information, there's no mention of Paleckis.

(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I have listened with great interest to your discussion and I hope you will allow me to touch on several of the issues that have been raised. First of all I would like to express my appreciation for the exceptional quality of the report by the rapporteurs, which can only be described as brilliant, in view of the complexity of the subject matter. Ladies and gentlemen, in the debate a number of arguments and opinions have been put forward, which in my view require a response.\nThe first opinion to be expressed was the view that this institution should become part of the human rights agenda. A series of speakers in the discussion have taken the view, which I fully support, that the question of equal opportunities goes far beyond the simple issue of human rights, albeit that human rights are of fundamental importance. The issue of equal opportunities is a broader issue.\nThere was a question as to whether it was right for the European Union to promote equal opportunities even in its international relations. I must state my firm conviction that there is a need for this. The EU is involved in countless international connections, both with the Member States and in the context of development aid and at a multilateral level, and each of these offers the opportunity of effectively reinforcing gender equality.\nLadies and gentlemen, I am convinced that gender equality, promoted and backed on a global scale, will provide a major source of global stability and is capable of pacifying many of our current conflicts. I also feel that the argument put forward in the debate that the institute will provide greater visibility and political transparency for the issues of equal rights and equal opportunities is correct. I fully support this argument. It is also right to remind ourselves, as was frequently stated in the debate, that we have much work still to do. Clearly, we are trying to define policies on the basis of argument, and that is one of the civilised outcomes of life in today\u2019s Europe. I might add that these are policies based on practical proofs and practical opinions. Even from this perspective the institute can enhance quality.\nIt is, in my view, apparent that there is a wealth of important information that is not being used effectively in political decision-making. Which of you, for example, knows that in Spain men spend 52 million hours a year taking care of others while for women the figure is 200\u00a0million hours. This is certainly an important indicator of how unequally we share some of the duties and responsibilities that we have as human beings \u2013 men and women. And yet none of this information feeds into political decision-making. I am convinced that the institute will make many things possible.\nLadies and gentlemen, one of the sound principles of European parliamentary life is multi-lingualism and we often discover that a given matter can be expressed more elegantly and accurately in some other European language. I hope you will therefore allow me to quote the German expression \u2018 Stillstand ist R\u00fcckschritt\u2019 . I am fully convinced that to stay where you are means in reality to retreat. Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to express an opinion on the amendments that are defined in the report, or which form part of your upcoming vote. The committee\u2019s attitude regarding the nature of the institute allows us to be flexible and to accept most of the amendments that strengthen the role and working methods of the institute, including the creation of the network for the institute. These amendments are acceptable in their original form, either in part or after reworking. The second category includes the amendments that increase the readability of the text and which the Commission equally can accept in their original form or after a small amount of reworking. The third group are the amendments that relate to the legal presentation techniques, which, although they are constructive, mark a departure from the original provisions of the existing instruments and therefore cannot be adopted, for reasons of maintaining cohesion. Finally there are the amendments that relate to horizontal questions, in other words to all agencies and organisations, in respect of procedures for selecting directors, extending their contracts and assessing organisations. These amendments cannot be accepted, because it is necessary to maintain a certain principle of cohesion in relation to all agencies.\nI have left to the end the question of the composition of the governing council. We are delighted that the Committee on Women\u2019s Rights and Gender Equality has come out in favour of limiting the number of members on the governing council and that it has followed the European Parliament resolution from December last year on an operational framework for future regulatory agencies. We can now be guided by this proposal, although the number of Commission representatives is not the same as in the case of the Council. The equilibrium between the two organisations and between the two levels of interest, which is to say the national level and the Community level, may be further secured if, in accordance with the proposal and where the Commission has responsibility, the voice of its representative carries the same weight as the voices of all of the Council representatives together, in the very limited number of cases involving the approval of budgets and programmes of work. We therefore accept Amendments 66, 82 and 85 relating to the composition of the governing council and voting regulations. In the same spirit we agree that the number of members can be reduced to a mere 25 representatives of the Member States, as stated in Amendments 67 and 83, and we consider it sufficient that participating parties are present at meetings of the governing council without voting rights. We hope that the Council will be able to adopt your proposal for the governing council, which, together with the rotating system, will allow representatives from all Member States to alternate over a period of three mandates.\nIn conclusion, I would like to say that we took pains to adopt as many of your amendments as possible. The Commission can now adopt Amendments 2 to 10, 13, 15, 17, 18, 20, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29, 35, 36, 38 to 42, 44, 45, 48, 53, 55, 59 to 69, 74 and 76 to 85. The Commission cannot adopt Amendments 1, 11, 12, 14, 16, 19, 21 to 23, 27, 30 to 34, 37, 43, 46, 47, 49 to 52, 54, 56 to 58, 70 to 73 and part of 75. We should also pay regard to the discussions in the Council, and we must take every effort to ensure that an acceptable compromise is achieved by the end of the year. The Commission is counting on the support of the European Parliament to set up this much needed European institute, and it is important to ensure that the organisation begins work in 2007, in the interests of progress and to raise the profile of the gender equality policy. I will of course be submitting an opinion on individual amendments in writing later.\n(Applause)", "lang": "EN", "original": "Vladim\u00edr \u0160pidla, Member of the Commission .

We should also pay regard to the discussions in the Council, and we must take every effort to ensure that an acceptable compromise is achieved by the end of the year.

(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I have listened with great interest to your discussion and I hope you will allow me to touch on several of the issues that have been raised. First of all I would like to express my appreciation for the exceptional quality of the report by the rapporteurs, which can only be described as brilliant, in view of the complexity of the subject matter. Ladies and gentlemen, in the debate a number of arguments and opinions have been put forward, which in my view require a response.\nThe first opinion to be expressed was the view that this institution should become part of the human rights agenda. A series of speakers in the discussion have taken the view, which I fully support, that the question of equal opportunities goes far beyond the simple issue of human rights, albeit that human rights are of fundamental importance. The issue of equal opportunities is a broader issue.\nThere was a question as to whether it was right for the European Union to promote equal opportunities even in its international relations. I must state my firm conviction that there is a need for this. The EU is involved in countless international connections, both with the Member States and in the context of development aid and at a multilateral level, and each of these offers the opportunity of effectively reinforcing gender equality.\nLadies and gentlemen, I am convinced that gender equality, promoted and backed on a global scale, will provide a major source of global stability and is capable of pacifying many of our current conflicts. I also feel that the argument put forward in the debate that the institute will provide greater visibility and political transparency for the issues of equal rights and equal opportunities is correct. I fully support this argument. It is also right to remind ourselves, as was frequently stated in the debate, that we have much work still to do. Clearly, we are trying to define policies on the basis of argument, and that is one of the civilised outcomes of life in today\u2019s Europe. I might add that these are policies based on practical proofs and practical opinions. Even from this perspective the institute can enhance quality.\nIt is, in my view, apparent that there is a wealth of important information that is not being used effectively in political decision-making. Which of you, for example, knows that in Spain men spend 52 million hours a year taking care of others while for women the figure is 200\u00a0million hours. This is certainly an important indicator of how unequally we share some of the duties and responsibilities that we have as human beings \u2013 men and women. And yet none of this information feeds into political decision-making. I am convinced that the institute will make many things possible.\nLadies and gentlemen, one of the sound principles of European parliamentary life is multi-lingualism and we often discover that a given matter can be expressed more elegantly and accurately in some other European language. I hope you will therefore allow me to quote the German expression \u2018 Stillstand ist R\u00fcckschritt\u2019 . I am fully convinced that to stay where you are means in reality to retreat. Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to express an opinion on the amendments that are defined in the report, or which form part of your upcoming vote. The committee\u2019s attitude regarding the nature of the institute allows us to be flexible and to accept most of the amendments that strengthen the role and working methods of the institute, including the creation of the network for the institute. These amendments are acceptable in their original form, either in part or after reworking. The second category includes the amendments that increase the readability of the text and which the Commission equally can accept in their original form or after a small amount of reworking. The third group are the amendments that relate to the legal presentation techniques, which, although they are constructive, mark a departure from the original provisions of the existing instruments and therefore cannot be adopted, for reasons of maintaining cohesion. Finally there are the amendments that relate to horizontal questions, in other words to all agencies and organisations, in respect of procedures for selecting directors, extending their contracts and assessing organisations. These amendments cannot be accepted, because it is necessary to maintain a certain principle of cohesion in relation to all agencies.\nI have left to the end the question of the composition of the governing council. We are delighted that the Committee on Women\u2019s Rights and Gender Equality has come out in favour of limiting the number of members on the governing council and that it has followed the European Parliament resolution from December last year on an operational framework for future regulatory agencies. We can now be guided by this proposal, although the number of Commission representatives is not the same as in the case of the Council. The equilibrium between the two organisations and between the two levels of interest, which is to say the national level and the Community level, may be further secured if, in accordance with the proposal and where the Commission has responsibility, the voice of its representative carries the same weight as the voices of all of the Council representatives together, in the very limited number of cases involving the approval of budgets and programmes of work. We therefore accept Amendments 66, 82 and 85 relating to the composition of the governing council and voting regulations. In the same spirit we agree that the number of members can be reduced to a mere 25 representatives of the Member States, as stated in Amendments 67 and 83, and we consider it sufficient that participating parties are present at meetings of the governing council without voting rights. We hope that the Council will be able to adopt your proposal for the governing council, which, together with the rotating system, will allow representatives from all Member States to alternate over a period of three mandates.\nIn conclusion, I would like to say that we took pains to adopt as many of your amendments as possible.

Let me start by reading through the summary carefully.\n\nThe user mentioned that the debate was about the establishment of a European Institute for Gender Equality. The summary has several sections, including Strong Support Coalition, Key Areas of Consensus, Opposition and Concerns, etc. The speaker in question is Vladim\u00edr \u0160pidla, who is mentioned as the Commissioner. \n\nLooking at the Strong Support Coalition section, it says that Commissioner \u0160pidla positioned gender equality as both an economic necessity and a democratic imperative. His quote is: \"if we fail to exploit the potential offered by women, we will not achieve the Lisbon objectives, and moreover we will be unable to compete on a global level.\" He also emphasized the institute's role in gathering reliable data and providing technical support for policy development.\n\nThen, in the Commission Response section, it mentions that \u0160pidla accepted most parliamentary amendments and emphasized urgency, saying the Commission is counting on the Parliament's support to set up the institute, with the goal of starting work in 2007. He also provided details on which of the 85 amendments could be accepted while maintaining institutional coherence.\n\nSo, the main points from \u0160pidla would be:\n\n1. Gender equality as an economic and democratic necessity.\n2. Linking gender equality to achieving Lisbon objectives and global competitiveness.\n3. The institute's role in data collection and technical support for policies.\n4. Accepting most amendments and stressing the urgency of establishing the institute by 2007.\n5.
