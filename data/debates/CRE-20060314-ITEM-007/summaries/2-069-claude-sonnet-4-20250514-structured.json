{"speaker": "Eugenijus Gentvilas (ALDE).", "english": "Eugenijus Gentvilas (ALDE). \u2013 (LT) I am delighted with this report. I believe that it is very important for the identity of the new modern Europe. The equal opportunities problem is especially relevant in the states of Eastern Europe. Indeed, it is no accident that Slovenia, Slovakia and Lithuania aspire to establish this institute in their countries. Women in Eastern European states are still frequently regarded as homemakers and are not integrated into economic processes. The European Parliament has its Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. In many European states there are ministries, departments and other institutions dedicated to gender equality. That is why I believe it is logical to establish such an institution across the entire European Union. I, therefore, endorse the efforts of rapporteurs L. Gr\u00f6ner and A. Sartori, together with their argument that an independent institute can operate much more effectively than one which is part of another agency. I would like to stress that the institute is needed for men as well as women, and it is a shame that the majority of those speaking today were women.", "lang": "LT", "original": "Eugenijus Gentvilas (ALDE). \u2013 D\u017eiaugiuosi \u0161iuo prane\u0161imu.
