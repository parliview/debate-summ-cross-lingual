The task of the Institute will be to collect and analyse gender equality data in the EU countries, as well as to organise conferences and campaigns. It seems to me entirely wrong to call into question the establishment of the Institute and, in this regard, I also object to the way that doubt has been cast on the Slovak Republic as a potential location for the Institute.\nI am not going to list every institution that is based in the territories of the fifteen old Member States. I respect the fact that during the founding of the European Union such centres had to be established and further developed as part of a coordinated joint action. I therefore urge you to cast your votes in favour of establishing this Institute.\nThe Gender Institute could function as an ombudsman for women, a mediator between the government and non-governmental organisations in eliminating injustices, such as discrimination in labour relations. After all, it is widely known that the lowest wages are commonly found in so-called \u2018female sectors\u2019, that is, in education and healthcare, whereas the highest wages are typical of male-dominated occupations, such as the armed forces and police.
