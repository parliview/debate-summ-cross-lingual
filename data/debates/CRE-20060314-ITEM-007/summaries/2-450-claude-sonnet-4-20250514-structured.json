The EU\u2019s new Institute for Gender Equality is to analyse equality in the EU by comparing data from different Member States.\nThe obvious question to be asked is: what added value will this authority contribute? Will it have a practical and significant job to do, or will it mainly be a way for the EU institutions to demonstrate their ability to take action? Will the authority help increase gender equality, or will it mainly constitute a type of alibi and way of showing that the EU cares about equality issues?\nThe arguments presented in the report are unconvincing. The authority\u2019s tasks could be carried out within the framework of existing structures. The EU already has its central statistics agency, Eurostat, which is able to produce comparative statistics on gender equality in EU countries. There are also national authorities that work on equality issues and that can cooperate across national borders.\nThe Commission consists of 18 men and 7 women. Approximately 30% of MEPs are women. The EU institutions should begin by applying equality within their own structures and in that way setting an example, before new centralised EU authorities are set up. Cooperation can also take place in more decentralised forms, without the EU growing larger as a result of new authorities being created for every important issue.", "lang": "SV", "original": "H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Goudin (IND/DEM). \u2013 Junilistan anser att j\u00e4mst\u00e4lldhetsfr\u00e5gor \u00e4r betydelsefulla och att lika behandling av kvinnor och m\u00e4n \u00e4r en absolut sj\u00e4lvklarhet i alla sammanhang.
