I did in fact propose in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs that it should be called an agency rather than an institute. Through this amendment I sought to stress the political commitment of the institution, rather than its academic dimension, which would be conveyed by the word institute.\nIn any event, to coincide with international women\u2019s day as it were, by taking this decision the European Parliament is encouraging a new step in the establishment of equal opportunities, something I consider to be one of the fundamental ambitions of a modern Europe. I hope that the institute will not be simply a passive statistical office there to measure equality or inequality, but will also be an active proponent of new strategies that will ensure actual progress in respect of equality.\nI cannot resist the temptation to tell this distinguished Chamber about Slovenia\u2019s candidacy to host the institute. If Slovenia is chosen, this will be an encouraging decision, for while on the one hand we have been particularly successful in our transition, the data do indicate, however, that men have enjoyed greater success than women. On the other hand the authorities are striving actively to change things, and in this light establishing the institute in a new Member State would be an auspicious decision, since it would encourage positive shifts.", "lang": "SL", "original": "Borut Pahor (PSE), pripravljavec mnenja Odbora za ustavne zadeve \u2013 Preden povem nekaj svojih misli, bi \u017eelel podpreti kolegico, ki je malo pred menoj govorila o pomenu finan\u010dnih sredstev za uspe\u0161no delo in\u0161tituta.\nOgla\u0161am se kot pripravljavec mnenja v okviru Odbora za ustavne zadeve in izra\u017eam zadovoljstvo nad predlogom za ustanovitev Evropskega in\u0161tituta za enakost med spoloma.
