The demographic issue has not been resolved. In the interests of fathers, mothers and children, we must reconcile family life and professional life as a matter of urgency. The Lisbon Strategy has been far from successful. Who takes the creation of the human capital of future generations seriously? Who takes solidarity between the generations seriously? These informal, unpaid economic activities are hard work, and are mostly performed by women. Neither is the role of men in the process of gender equality taken into account at all.\nI consequently think it is worthwhile to promote methods of monitoring and condemning the unacceptable differences suffered by women compared to men. Any initiative that objectively condemns these injustices cannot fail to be welcome, going beyond any political differences of opinion.", "lang": "FR", "original": "Anna Z\u00e1borsk\u00e1, au nom du groupe PPE-DE . - Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, Monsieur le Commissaire, chers coll\u00e8gues, j\u2019exprime ma profonde reconnaissance \u00e0 Lissy Gr\u00f6ner et \u00e0 Amalia\u00a0Sartori pour leur excellent travail d\u2019\u00e9quipe au sein de la commission des droits de la femme.\nJ\u2019ose poser la question iconoclaste: pourrait-on se passer d\u2019un p\u00f4le de vigilance traitant exclusivement des diff\u00e9rences de traitement entre les hommes et les femmes?\nDepuis trente ans, malgr\u00e9 toutes nos directives europ\u00e9ennes, l\u2019in\u00e9galit\u00e9 persistante de traitement hommes/femmes dans toutes les activit\u00e9s \u00e9conomiques est une insulte \u00e0 notre d\u00e9mocratie.
