{"speaker": "Marie-Line Reynaud (PSE). \u2013", "english": "Marie-Line Reynaud (PSE). \u2013 (FR) I would like to thank the two co-rapporteurs, Mr\u00a0Gr\u00f6ner and Mrs\u00a0Sartori, for their excellent work. Indeed, this report adds to the Commission's initial text a number of improvements that I had also proposed in my draft opinion in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.\nI would like to point to four of them. First of all, there is the proactive role given to the institute, particularly through its analysis and expertise missions and the option it is given of submitting its recommendations and guidelines to the Community institutions. Next, there is the importance of cooperation with the fundamental rights agency. Then there is the need for balanced participation of men and women in the management board, and, finally, there is the role of the European Parliament, particularly concerning the nomination of the director of the institute and of the members of the management board and monitoring their work.\nThis Gender Institute is a vital part of a true Europe of citizens, and I was extremely disappointed that my draft report was rejected by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, 18 votes to 18, because part of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and part of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe wanted to prevent this institute from seeing the light of day.
