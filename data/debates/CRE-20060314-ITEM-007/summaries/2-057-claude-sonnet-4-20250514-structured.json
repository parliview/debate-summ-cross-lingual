The promoters see it as more important to have the kudos of an exclusive body than the reality of an across-the-board transformation of society.\nThe Gender Institute should in fact be part of the new EU Agency on Fundamental Rights, just as the Anti-Racism Monitoring Centre will be. If gender is the only equality objective that stays outside the Fundamental Rights Agency, that will create an unbalanced model as well as weakening the latter agency.

On the contrary, women can spearhead the campaign for equality in human rights for all through the Fundamental Rights Agency.
