{"speaker": "Teresa Riera Madurell (PSE).", "english": "Teresa Riera Madurell (PSE). \u2013 (ES) Mr President, I would like first of all to congratulate the rapporteurs on their report and express my satisfaction with the Commission\u2019s efforts to provide the European Union with an independent body specifically dedicated to gender equality issues.\nI would like to emphasise the need for the Institute to have full independence, without conditions of any kind. This is a fundamental objective if the Institute is to be able to fulfil its objectives, which go far beyond simply providing the Commission with technical assistance.\nAs a working method, I believe that the idea of creating a European gender equality network is clearly very innovative and effective, above all with a view to meeting the essential time and distance requirements for the sharing and exchange of knowledge, information and policies.\nWith regard to the structure of the Institute, I believe that an acceptable solution to the issue of the composition of the Management Board has finally been found. This provides for a fair and effective distribution of functions amongst the three institutions, and one appropriate to the actual situation of a body that will unfortunately be under-funded and under-staffed. In this regard, I would like to emphasise that, in order for the Institute to be able to fulfil its objectives, adequate funding that gives credibility to the European Union\u2019s commitment to gender equality is essential.\nThis is something that we must all bear very much in mind at the moment in the negotiations that are taking place amongst the different institutions with regard to funding.", "lang": "ES", "original": "Teresa Riera Madurell (PSE). \u2013 (ES) Se\u00f1or Presidente, ante todo quiero felicitar a las ponentes por su informe y expresar mi satisfacci\u00f3n por los esfuerzos de la Comisi\u00f3n para que la Uni\u00f3n Europea pueda disponer de un organismo independiente dedicado espec\u00edficamente a los asuntos relativos a la igualdad de g\u00e9nero.\nQuiero insistir en la necesidad de que el Instituto goce de una completa independencia, sin ning\u00fan tipo de condici\u00f3n.
