This new Institute must not simply restrict itself to gathering statistical data if it is to promote and implement a gender equality policy effectively in the enlarged Union. It must focus instead on analysing the data in detail and drafting the advice and guidelines needed to mainstream the concept of gender equality effectively in the European legal system. It should be borne in mind that gender equality, which the Institute is charged with promoting, is a fundamental right and a priority Community policy. It is enshrined in the Treaty and must be implemented across all areas of social and economic activity, notably as regards access to employment and entrepreneurship.\nIt would be appropriate for the Institute\u2019s seat to be located in the new part of the united Europe, perhaps in Poland.
