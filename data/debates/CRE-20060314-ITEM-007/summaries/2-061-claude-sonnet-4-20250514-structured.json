{"speaker": "Wojciech Roszkowski,", "english": "Wojciech Roszkowski, on behalf of the UEN Group . \u2013 (PL) Mr\u00a0President, equality between men and women is an oft-repeated mantra within the European Union. Common sense tells us, however, that this is not at all a straightforward matter. Men and women are referred to as such precisely because they are different. They are equal in terms of dignity but they are different. This is obvious in the world of sport mentioned earlier. I have recently been attempting to discover how the European Commission understands this formula, especially as the formula is very often accompanied by the corollary in all areas. So be it. I therefore enquired if this equality stems from the law of nature or from statute law, and what can be done to enable men to bear children. Commissioner\u00a0\u0160pidla replied that the principle of gender equality only applies to work and to access to goods and services. That is contrary to fact. After all, Article\u00a023 in Chapter\u00a0III of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union clearly refers to all areas. If the European Commission is unable to resolve the problem in European law, I doubt the planned institute will manage to do so.", "lang": "PL", "original": "Wojciech Roszkowski, w imieniu grupy UEN . \u2013 Panie Przewodnicz\u0105cy!
