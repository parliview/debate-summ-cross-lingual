{"speaker": "Lydia Schenardi (NI). \u2013", "english": "Lydia Schenardi (NI). \u2013 (FR) Mr\u00a0President, one thing is certain: there is no lack of structures and networks of all kinds devoted to studying and standing up for women. There are the Institute for Gender Equality, various NGOs, ad hoc committees, fundamental rights agencies, consultative forums on women's rights, the European women's lobby, and our own committee within Parliament.\nTherefore, is it really reasonable to set up a new European Institute for Gender Equality? In this cloud of structures, not always operating in perfect harmony in terms of the exchange of information, will this new body, which is supposed to network all of this information, have actual resources allowing it to exist? To be clear, can we now be sure that, beyond its future operationality, it will be completely politically and financially independent?\nIt would appear not, as the Commission is not inclined to give this future institute very much room for manoeuvre. Indeed, its reluctance to allow the director of the institute to be answerable solely to the management board and not to the Commission is very revealing in that regard.\nFor all these reasons and more besides, I cannot vote in favour of this initiative to create what I would describe as just yet another labyrinthine system.", "lang": "FR", "original": "Lydia Schenardi (NI). - Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, une chose est s\u00fbre, les structures, r\u00e9seaux en tous genres, ayant vocation \u00e0 \u00e9tudier et d\u00e9fendre les femmes, ne manquent pas. On peut citer l\u2019Institut pour l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 entre les hommes et les femmes, les diverses ONG, comit\u00e9s ad hoc, agences des droits fondamentaux, les forums consultatifs sur les droits des femmes, le lobby europ\u00e9en des femmes, ou notre propre commission au sein du Parlement.\nAlors, est-il r\u00e9ellement raisonnable de cr\u00e9er un nouvel institut europ\u00e9en en charge de l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 entre hommes et femmes? Dans cette n\u00e9buleuse de structures ne fonctionnant pas toujours en parfaite harmonie dans l\u2019\u00e9change des informations, ce nouvel organe cens\u00e9 mettre en r\u00e9seau toutes ces informations aura-t-il les moyens r\u00e9els d\u2019exister?
