I will not go back over the detail of the report and will merely refer to two sessions, that in Bamako in April\u00a02005 and that in Edinburgh in November\u00a02005, without forgetting the next session, which will be held in Vienna in June\u00a02006. I should like to point out in this Chamber just how worthwhile it is, as was the case this year, for sessions organised in Europe to be held in the country holding the Presidency. It does, in fact, seem extremely logical to maintain and to perpetuate this system, which was adopted two years ago.\nI should also like to highlight the very solid contribution of our colleagues from the ACP countries, and we must congratulate them on that. We simultaneously conducted six joint missions, and allow me for the first - but not the last - time to emphasise the adjective \u2018joint\u2019. It is essential, in fact, that both the Permanent Assembly and the missions share a joint vision of matters. To do the opposite would make no sense at all. I should also like to point out that an increasing number of horizontal votes between the ACP countries and the EU representation have been held. In my opinion, the practice of separating houses must be drawn on as little as possible without it being necessarily removed from our Rules of Procedure. That being said, it is true that the objective, in the long term, would be to hold an increasing number of votes that make it possible to secure an ACP-EU majority.\nFurthermore, it appears that our colleagues from the ACP countries are less involved in what we might call an \u2018intellectual\u2019 capacity. By that I mean that we are in agreement with them on the fact that what was an expense for us \u2013 namely, in actual fact, the EU expenditure that consists of the ACP budget \u2013 is revenue for them. The need for parliamentary control at these two levels is, moreover, becoming increasingly clear to them. To this end, we, for our part, have requested the budgetisation of the EDF in order to guarantee parliamentary control regarding the use of this Community expenditure but, at the same time, the parliaments of the ACP countries also need to submit to parliamentary control what they consider to be revenue. That is a joint battle that we will have to fight if the vital need for parliamentary control is to be recognised.\nAs for the future of the ACP, I welcome the amendment made to the Cotonou Agreement. The budget for the tenth EDF now amounts to EUR\u00a022.682\u00a0billion. We have already complained in this Chamber about this sum, which does not live up to our expectations of EUR\u00a024\u00a0billion. The Austrian Presidency has already responded to us. I have no doubt that my fellow Members will shortly take the floor on this subject in order to request a realignment. It is not a matter of endlessly repeating the same questions, but we are awaiting more forceful responses than the ones we have been given.\nThe EDF surplus also poses a problem. To date, it stands at almost EUR\u00a011\u00a0billion, which naturally raises questions about the procedure and the ambition of the projects dealt with, because it is unforgivable that EUR\u00a011\u00a0billion should not have been spent in countries that have such glaringly obvious needs.\nWhat does the future hold for the EDF? If we fulfil our political commitments in 2010 and if we succeed in devoting 0.56% of our GDP to development aid, then the European Union will grant an additional EUR\u00a050\u00a0billion per year to this budget, even though it had made the political commitment to devote only half of that amount, or EUR\u00a025\u00a0billion, to Africa. It is quite clear that if this policy is complied with, the additional aid that is available will actually correspond to one annual EDF budget. Nevertheless, if the way in which we spend that budget were to be examined, it would only raise questions.\nFurthermore, I wonder about the proportion of the aid to developing countries that will be managed by the European Union and that will be in the region of 20%. In that case, even if my choice of term is a little strong, the EDF will be reduced to the status of a minor instrument of aid. The problem of its budgetisation, which is absolutely crucial and needs to be done as soon as possible, thus becomes even more acute, as does that of its \u2018fungibility\u2019, meaning the possibility of granting very ambitious regional projects, such as rail infrastructure, a place in the European Union\u2019s general system for action. That is what would make it possible to ensure coordination between the member countries and the European Union. The EDF can become that coordination lever, and the Joint Parliamentary Assembly can become an element of specific control, in the knowledge that all of the least developed countries in the world are members of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly.\nFinally, there is above all the problem of understanding European Union policy. What I was describing just now as Community expenditure earmarked for development aid is provided by our taxpayers. As such, action must be clear because it is no good the populists grabbing hold of the figures that I have announced to you and crying out: \u2018What on earth are you doing with all of that money?\u2019 We therefore need this matter to be viewed and understood from a political perspective.", "lang": "FR", "original": "Thierry Cornillet (ALDE), rapporteur . - Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, le rapport sur les travaux de l\u2019Assembl\u00e9e parlementaire paritaire pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2005 est effectivement inscrit \u00e0 l\u2019ordre du jour. Je ne rentrerai pas dans le d\u00e9tail du rapport et me contenterai de faire r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 deux sessions, celle de Bamako en avril\u00a02005 et celle d\u2019Edimbourg en novembre\u00a02005, sans oublier la prochaine session, qui se tiendra \u00e0 Vienne en juin\u00a02006. Je voudrais souligner ici tout l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat qu\u2019il y a, comme ce fut le cas cette ann\u00e9e, \u00e0 ce que les sessions organis\u00e9es en Europe se tiennent dans le pays de la Pr\u00e9sidence. En effet, il semble extr\u00eamement logique de maintenir et de p\u00e9renniser ce syst\u00e8me adopt\u00e9 depuis deux ans.\nJe voudrais \u00e9galement souligner la tr\u00e8s forte participation de nos coll\u00e8gues des pays\u00a0ACP, et il faut les en f\u00e9liciter. Parall\u00e8lement, nous avons men\u00e9 six missions conjointes et permettez-moi d\u2019insister pour la premi\u00e8re fois - je le ferai encore\u00a0- sur l\u2019adjectif \u00abconjoint\u00bb. En effet, il est essentiel que l\u2019Assembl\u00e9e permanente aussi bien que les missions partagent une vision conjointe des choses. Le contraire n\u2019aurait d\u2019ailleurs aucun sens. Je voudrais \u00e9galement signaler l\u2019organisation de votes transversaux de plus en plus nombreux entre les pays ACP et la repr\u00e9sentation de l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne. Selon moi, la pratique des coll\u00e8ges s\u00e9par\u00e9s doit \u00eatre utilis\u00e9e le moins possible sans pour autant \u00eatre n\u00e9cessairement supprim\u00e9e de notre r\u00e8glement int\u00e9rieur. Cela dit, il est vrai que l\u2019objectif, \u00e0 terme, consisterait \u00e0 organiser de plus en plus de votes qui permettent de d\u00e9gager une majorit\u00e9 ACP-Union europ\u00e9enne.\nPar ailleurs, il appara\u00eet que nos coll\u00e8gues des pays ACP sont moins impliqu\u00e9s, je dirais intellectuellement. J\u2019entends par l\u00e0 que nous sommes convenus avec eux du fait que ce qui pour nous \u00e9tait une d\u00e9pense - \u00e0 savoir en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 la d\u00e9pense de l\u2019UE que constitue le budget de l\u2019ACP\u00a0-, repr\u00e9sente pour eux une recette. La n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019un contr\u00f4le parlementaire \u00e0 ces deux niveaux se fait d\u2019ailleurs de plus en plus claire dans leur t\u00eate. \u00c0 cette fin, nous avons nous-m\u00eames demand\u00e9 la budg\u00e9tisation du FED, afin de garantir un contr\u00f4le parlementaire concernant l\u2019usage de cette d\u00e9pense communautaire, mais il faut qu\u2019en parall\u00e8le, les parlements des pays ACP soumettent \u00e9galement ce qu\u2019ils consid\u00e8rent comme une recette \u00e0 un contr\u00f4le parlementaire. C\u2019est l\u00e0 une bataille conjointe qu\u2019il nous faudra mener pour la reconnaissance de l\u2019absolue n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019un contr\u00f4le parlementaire.\nEn ce qui concerne l\u2019avenir de l\u2019ACP, je me f\u00e9licite de la modification apport\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019Accord de Cotonou. Le budget du dixi\u00e8me FED s\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve aujourd\u2019hui \u00e0 22,682\u00a0milliards d\u2019euros. Nous avons d\u00e9j\u00e0, dans cette enceinte, formul\u00e9 des r\u00e9clamations sur ce montant qui n\u2019est pas conforme \u00e0 nos attentes: 24\u00a0milliards d\u2019euros. La Pr\u00e9sidence autrichienne nous a d\u00e9j\u00e0 r\u00e9pondu. Je ne doute pas que mes coll\u00e8gues, tout \u00e0 l\u2019heure, reprendront la parole sur ce sujet pour demander un r\u00e9alignement. Il ne s\u2019agit pas de r\u00e9p\u00e9ter ind\u00e9finiment les m\u00eames questions, mais nous attendons des r\u00e9ponses plus fortes que celles qui nous ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites.\nL\u2019exc\u00e9dent du FED pose \u00e9galement un probl\u00e8me. Il s\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 ce jour \u00e0 pr\u00e8s de 11\u00a0milliards d\u2019euros, ce qui soul\u00e8ve naturellement des questions concernant la proc\u00e9dure et l\u2019ambition des projets trait\u00e9s, parce qu\u2019il est intol\u00e9rable que 11\u00a0milliards d\u2019euros puissent ne pas avoir encore \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pens\u00e9s dans des pays o\u00f9 les besoins sont aussi criants.\nQuel avenir pour le FED? Si nous tenons nos engagements politiques en\u00a02010 et si nous parvenons \u00e0 consacrer 0,56% de notre PIB \u00e0 l\u2019aide au d\u00e9veloppement, alors l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne accordera 50\u00a0milliards d\u2019euros suppl\u00e9mentaires par an \u00e0 ce budget, alors m\u00eame qu\u2019elle s\u2019\u00e9tait politiquement engag\u00e9e \u00e0 ne consacrer que la moiti\u00e9 de ce montant \u00e0 l\u2019Afrique, soit 25\u00a0milliards d\u2019euros. On voit bien que si cette politique est respect\u00e9e, l\u2019aide suppl\u00e9mentaire disponible correspondra en fait \u00e0 un budget annuel du FED. Et pourtant, si on \u00e9tudie la fa\u00e7on dont nous d\u00e9pensons ce budget, on ne peut que se poser des questions.\nPar ailleurs, je m\u2019interroge quant \u00e0 la part de l\u2019aide aux pays en d\u00e9veloppement (APD) qui sera g\u00e9r\u00e9e par l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne et sera de l\u2019ordre de\u00a020%. Dans ce cas, m\u00eame si le mot est peut-\u00eatre un peu fort, le FED sera rel\u00e9gu\u00e9 au rang d\u2019instrument marginal de l\u2019aide. Se pose donc avec encore plus d\u2019acuit\u00e9 le probl\u00e8me de sa budg\u00e9tisation, absolument n\u00e9cessaire et dans les plus brefs d\u00e9lais, ainsi que celui de sa \u00abfongibilit\u00e9\u00bb, soit la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019accorder \u00e0 des projets r\u00e9gionaux tr\u00e8s ambitieux, comme les infrastructures ferroviaires, une place dans le dispositif g\u00e9n\u00e9ral d\u2019action de l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne. Voil\u00e0 qui permettrait d\u2019assurer la coordination entre les pays membres et l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne. Le FED peut devenir ce levier de coordination et l\u2019Assembl\u00e9e parlementaire paritaire peut devenir un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de contr\u00f4le sp\u00e9cifique, sachant que l\u2019ensemble des pays les moins avanc\u00e9s au monde sont membres de l\u2019Assembl\u00e9e parlementaire paritaire.\nEnfin, se pose surtout le probl\u00e8me de la lisibilit\u00e9 de l\u2019action de l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne.

The user provided a debate summary about the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2005 and wants the response focused on Mariann Fischer Boel. First, I need to scan through the summary to find all mentions of her.\n\nLooking at the sections, there's a part under \"Financial and Administrative Challenges\" where she's mentioned. The summary says Commissioner Fischer Boel defended the timeline regarding sugar protocol funding, stating that ACP countries have enough time with EUR 40 million available in 2006. Also, in the \"Conclusion\" section, it mentions her commitment to supporting regional parliamentary meetings. \n\nWait, the user specified that only the points attributed to the speaker should be included. So I need to make sure that any arguments, positions, issues, or proposals mentioned in the summary that are directly from Fischer Boel are included. \n\nIn the \"Democracy, Governance, and Human Rights\" section, there's a mention of her defending the timeline for sugar protocol funding. Also, in the \"Regional Integration and Future Directions\" section, she's noted for committing to support regional parliamentary meetings. \n\nI need to structure this into the JSON format as per the example. The issueSum would be about the sugar protocol funding and regional integration. The positionSum would include her defense of the timeline and commitment to regional meetings. The argSum would be her reasoning for the timeline, citing adequate time for adaptation. The propSum would be her proposal to support regional meetings. \n\nWait, but the user's example has specific fields. Let me check again. The issueSum is the key issues raised by the speaker. So for Fischer Boel, the issues are the sugar protocol funding shortfall and regional integration. Her position is defending the timeline and committing to regional support. The arguments are based on the available funds and the need for adaptation. The proposals are supporting regional meetings. \n\nI need to make sure not to include other speakers' points. For example, Kinnock's points about EDF administration costs aren't hers. Only her contributions. So the final JSON should capture her specific points without overlapping with others.

I would also, at the outset, like to thank equally warmly our two co-presidents \u2013 the European co-president Mrs Kinnock, who is with us today, and, in her absence Sharon Hay-Webster, for their great dedication over the past year, which has been exemplary, and we look forward to their continuing with their work. The primary object of the Parliamentary Assembly is to reinforce the parliamentary dimension of the Cotonou Agreement. The many things that we do together are intended to help our counterparts gain influence in their own countries and gain the same self-confidence that we have gained over the years in our dealings with our governments and the executive.\nOur shared experiences, and our journeys together to various places, have led us to shared conclusions, for example as regards the reform of the market organisation for sugar. It is good that the Commissioner for Agriculture is present with us today, since she knows the figures inside out and knows what we in Europe are doing to lessen the impact of reform of the market organisation for sugar and how little, in comparison with that, is available for the countries concerned. It is apparent from that that our reform directly impacts on these countries, two of which \u2013 Guyana and Jamaica \u2013 I have myself visited. In Guyana, we can \u2013 without intending to \u2013 contribute to the destabilisation of a whole country if we do not lessen the impact of our reform by making adequate compensation available to that country.\nThere is another important aspect that I would like to highlight. We call on the Commission to set aside an appropriate proportion of European development funding for the political education of parliamentarians and other persons in positions of leadership, enabling the development in these countries of the sort of political culture that will strengthen responsible governance in the long term.\nIn conclusion, I would like to mention the official contact that we established with the Pan-African Parliament at the end of last year, when I was able, on behalf of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, to confer with Sharon Hay-Webster, and I have since become the chairman of this ad hoc delegation.

Es ist gut, dass die Agrarkommissarin heute anwesend ist, die die Zahlen ja genau kennt und wei\u00df, was wir in Europa zur Abfederung der Reform der Zuckermarktordnung unternehmen und wie wenig im Verh\u00e4ltnis dazu f\u00fcr diese L\u00e4nder vorhanden ist.

Ich durfte dort im Namen der Parit\u00e4tischen Parlamentarischen Versammlung AKP-EU mit Sharon Hay-Webster sprechen. Ich bin jetzt auch der Vorsitzende dieser Ad-hoc-Delegation geworden.

The role of the JPA is therefore very precious in the context of the Cotonou Agreements. It is a unique tool for dialogue between the North and the South. In the future, it must work more effectively, particularly in terms of dealing with major crisis situations, such as the one in Darfur, provided that it is given the resources to do so. This aspect is above all the responsibility of the European Union, which must attach political priority to this partnership with the ACP countries, by respecting its commitments in the negotiations under way on the sum of the tenth EDF and by finally refraining from taking back with the one hand what it gives with the other, as illustrated by the sugar reform.\nBy finally giving the JPA the political respect that it deserves, let us thus definitively enforce what is laid down in the Cotonou Agreement, that is to say that the Assembly shall meet in Europe in the country of the EU Presidency. Let us not welcome our ACP partners in a half-hearted fashion, as that would be a downright poor political signal for us to give. However, it is also the responsibility of the JPA itself. It must make progress with its reform and its working methods, and the next development could result in regional conferences being held. This objective could be set by the beginning of 2007.\nFinally, we, as members of the JPA, also have a political responsibility, by abstaining, for example, from voting in separate houses, which is not only the negation of the JPA\u2019s joint character, but also the means used all too often these days for the purposes of thwarting the outcome of a vote.

Even though, today, its continuation is probably a foregone conclusion, there are still a number of things wrong with it, and I shall sum some of them up.\nThere are still, among the ACP countries, six dictatorships, namely Zimbabwe, Equatorial Guinea, Sudan, Swaziland, Cuba and Eritrea. It is a matter of fact that these countries\u2019 dictators constitute an obstacle to their economic development. The Joint Parliamentary Assembly, and its Political Affairs Committee in particular, must make it a priority to bring real democracy to these countries. At the same time, the ACP countries also include a number of countries in which religious practices still prevail over the rule of law. The humanitarian tragedy in Darfur is a direct consequence of this, among other things. In some of them, women\u2019s rights count for nothing and the mutilation of women \u2013 despite what has already been done to counteract it \u2013 is still a daily occurrence.\nIt was the Cotonou Agreement that first acknowledged that corruption was an obstacle to development. It is still going on; it has not yet been stamped out, and constitutes a serious obstacle to the alleviation of the needs of the least well-off in these countries. Let me close by quoting the Indian Nobel economics prizewinner Amartya Sen: \u2018never yet has famine occurred in a democratic country\u2019.

Ik som er enige op.\nOnder de ACS-landen tellen wij nog steeds zes dictaturen, namelijk Zimbabwe, Equatoriaal-Guinea, Soedan, Swaziland, Cuba en Eritrea. Dat de dictators aldaar een rem vormen op de economische ontwikkelingen in hun landen, is een feit. De Paritaire Parlementaire Vergadering en in het bijzonder de Commissie politieke zaken moeten prioritair werk maken van echte democratie in deze landen. Onder de ACS-landen zijn er tevens een aantal landen waar de religieuze gebruiken nog steeds de bovenhand hebben op de rechtsstaat. Het humanitaire drama in Darfour is hier onder meer een rechtstreeks gevolg van. In een aantal landen zijn de vrouwenrechten van geen tel en is vrouwenverminking nog steeds een dagelijkse praktijk, in weerwil van de reeds genomen initiatieven terzake.\nIn het akkoord van Cotonou werd voor het eerst erkend dat corruptie een obstakel voor de ontwikkeling vormt. Deze courante praktijk raakt maar niet uitgeroeid en vormt een ernstige rem op de leniging van de noden van de minstbedeelden in deze landen.

We must see to it that both continue to help put the ACP countries in a stronger economic position, and in that respect good consultation with them will be of crucial importance and must involve their parliaments too.\nThis House treats cooperation between the ACP countries and the EU as being of particular importance, since it involves a Joint Parliamentary Assembly consisting of 77 members of this House and 77 members of the ACP countries\u2019 parliaments. We debate together and adopt resolutions together in what is a unique and valuable arrangement.

The user provided a debate summary about the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2005 and wants the main points from Maria Martens (PPE-DE). \n\nFirst, I need to locate Maria Martens' contributions in the summary. Scanning through the sections, under \"Regional Integration and Future Directions,\" there's a mention of Maria Martens. She emphasized that ACP countries are themselves responsible for their development, stating \"De landen zijn immers zelf als eerste verantwoordelijk voor hun ontwikkeling\" which translates to \"The countries are, after all, themselves primarily responsible for their development.\"\n\nNow, I need to structure the response into the four categories: issueSum, positionSum, argSum, propSum. \n\nFor \"issueSum,\" the key issue here is the responsibility of ACP countries in their own development. The summary mentions her emphasis on ACP ownership, so the issue is about the need for ACP countries to take primary responsibility.\n\n\"positionSum\" would be her position that the ACP countries should be the primary responsible parties for their development. \n\nThe \"argSum\" would be the reasoning behind her position. The summary doesn't explicitly state arguments, but since she emphasizes their responsibility, the argument is likely that external actors shouldn't overshadow their own efforts.\n\n\"propSum\" would be any proposals she made. The summary mentions she emphasized ACP ownership, but there's no specific proposal listed. However, the user's example includes a proposal even if it's a statement. Since she called for ACP ownership, the proposal might be to ensure ACP countries take primary responsibility.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says to only include points attributed to the speaker. The debate summary says she \"emphasized the importance of ACP ownership in development,\" so the proposal is to have ACP countries take ownership. \n\nI need to make sure not to include other speakers' points. The user's example has \"propSum\" as a proposal, so here it would be her call for ACP ownership. \n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nissueSum: The key issue is the need for ACP countries to take primary responsibility for their development.\n\npositionSum: She positions that ACP countries are primarily responsible for their development.\n\nargSum: The argument is that external support should not overshadow their own efforts, though the summary doesn't elaborate further.\n\npropSum: She proposed that ACP countries should take ownership of their development.\n\nI need to check if there's anything else. The summary also mentions Commissioner Fischer Boel's commitment to supporting regional meetings, but that's not from Martens. So only Martens' points. \n\nYes, that's all.

I am not therefore talking now about the situation concerning the ACP countries so much as the work of the delegation.\nFirstly I am grateful to the Bureau of the European Parliament for its decision to authorise the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly to be held in Edinburgh. The meeting was a success, and Great Britain, the country holding the presidency at the time, and the City of Edinburgh deserve praise for organising the event so well. I hope that it will be possible to organise the JPA in the country holding the presidency in future as well, because the place where the meetings are held brings true added value, as does the fact that the meetings are held by rotation in the EU-ACP countries.\nIt was also excellent that representatives of the ACP and the EU were able to participate in the informal council of ministers for development cooperation organised by the UK Presidency in October. Hopefully the practice will also continue when my country, Finland, takes over the presidency in July.\nThe ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly has an important role in implementing the political dialogue provided for by Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement. The objective is to strengthen democracy, good governance and the human rights situation. It is just a slight nuisance that our meetings always partly coincide with Committee Week. For me it has meant that I have never been able to be continuously present at a meeting. I do not know whether other Members share the same opinion, but I would think that it would be easier to get away during the week when Parliament\u2019s groups hold their meetings.

Scanning through the sections, under \"Operational Improvements,\" there's a mention of her. She suggested scheduling improvements to avoid conflicts with committee weeks. \n\nThe user's instructions say to only include points attributed to the specified speaker. So, I need to extract that specific point. The issue here is scheduling conflicts. Her position is that the Assembly should improve scheduling. The argument is probably to ensure better coordination and avoid overlaps. The proposal is to adjust the schedule.\n\nI need to structure this into the JSON format as per the example. The issueSum would be about scheduling conflicts. PositionSum is her call for scheduling improvements. ArgSum might be the reasoning, like avoiding conflicts.

The user's example has \"issueSum\", \"positionSum\", \"argSum\", \"propSum\". \n\nSo, for Eija-Riitta Korhola, the key point is scheduling improvements.

The argument is likely that better scheduling would prevent conflicts, and the proposal is to adjust the schedule. \n\nI need to make sure not to include other speakers' points.

The discussion touched upon the issue of the trafficking of women and girls from developing countries and the poorest parts of Europe to the wealthiest areas of Western Europe. Some 600\u00a0000 to 800\u00a0000 women are trafficked every year across international borders, which corresponds to more than the entire population of some ACP countries, for example Cape Verde, Djibouti and the Comoros Islands.\nThe Women\u2019s Forum established a bridge between countries of origin and destination. The debate was lively, with strong participation from the contingent from the ACP countries. In the final conclusions, the participants called on the Joint Parliamentary Assembly to draw up a report to identify the measures needed to combat this scourge in all ACP countries, including European, African and Caribbean countries.\nIt should be noted that the Forum was arranged for the fringe of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly and that resources are not made available for it. I therefore call on Parliament\u2019s services and the Conference of Presidents to consider harnessing funding for such a positive, results-focused organisation. On a more general level, the Joint Parliamentary Assembly last year discussed the situation in Darfur and West Africa, but did not address the breakdown in the rule of law and the electoral process, and the serious violations of human rights in countries of key, symbolic significance such as Ethiopia, where the African Union has its headquarters.\nThere have, however, been important developments in the fight against impunity in Africa; for example, the dictator Charles Taylor has been arrested and brought to justice. Other dictators such as Hiss\u00e8ne Habr\u00e9, and former Ethiopian dictator Mengistu, currently being harboured by ACP countries like Zimbabwe and Senegal, must also be brought to justice. These are further cases in which the Assembly can play a key role in ending impunity in Africa.\nOn this issue, I must say that it would be most useful if the debates were more genuine. Sometimes, there are ACP countries acting more as the ambassadors of their governments and less as critics of the situation in their countries. I feel that as MEPs we have a duty to find ways of supporting our counterparts from ACP countries who are determined to tell the truth and to encourage them to take action to bring about change and better governance in their countries.", "lang": "PT", "original": "Ana Maria Gomes (PSE). \u2013 Antes de mais, queria cumprimentar o colega Thierry Cornillet pelo seu relat\u00f3rio e a nossa Co-Presidente da Assembleia Parlamentar Parit\u00e1ria ACP-UE pela seriedade e pelo empenho na condu\u00e7\u00e3o dos trabalhos desta assembleia.\nGostaria, antes de mais, de chamar a aten\u00e7\u00e3o para as conclus\u00f5es do F\u00f3rum das Mulheres que se realizou \u00e0 margem da Assembleia durante a \u00faltima sess\u00e3o em Edimburgo, no m\u00eas de Novembro.

I would, though, like to reiterate something that has already been said, namely that it is important to give thought to the scheduling of the European meetings of the committees, which are held in Brussels. It is sometimes a real shame that we should have to take part in votes in our own specialist committees, which can go on for hours, and are thereby prevented from taking part in the exciting and important debates in the ACP-EU committees, which is sometimes \u2013 wrongly \u2013 taken as an indication of a lack of interest.", "lang": "DE", "original": "Karin Scheele (PSE). \u2013 Herr Pr\u00e4sident!

The user provided a debate summary about the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2005 and wants the response focused on Karin Scheele's contributions.\n\nFirst, I need to scan through the debate summary to find any mentions of Karin Scheele. Looking at the sections, there's a part under \"Operational Improvements\" where Karin Scheele is mentioned. The quote is: \"Karin Scheele praised the women's forum for addressing sensitive issues like female genital mutilation.\"\n\nSo, the key points here are that she praised the women's forum. The issue she's addressing is the handling of sensitive issues such as female genital mutilation. Her position is positive towards the women's forum's efforts. The argument is that the forum is effective in tackling these issues. The proposal or action she's supporting is the continuation or recognition of the women's forum's work.\n\nI need to make sure I don't include other speakers' points. The user specified that only Karin Scheele's contributions should be included. The other parts of the debate, like financial issues or trade policies, aren't relevant here. \n\nNow, structuring the JSON. The issueSum should mention the sensitive issues like female genital mutilation. PositionSum is her praise for the women's forum. ArgSum would be that the forum's approach is effective. PropSum is her support for the forum's role. \n\nWait, the example response has \"propSum\" as a proposal. But in her case, she's praising the forum, not making a new proposal. So maybe the propSum is about the forum's work. The user's example might have \"propSum\" as a proposal, but in this case, she's not proposing a new action but acknowledging existing efforts. So perhaps the propSum is \"praised the women's forum for addressing sensitive issues...\" but the example uses \"advocates\" or \"calls for\". Hmm.\n\nThe user's instruction says \"proposals or policy actions mentioned by the speaker\". Since she's praising the forum, maybe there's no specific proposal, but the act of praising could be seen as supporting the forum's initiatives. So the propSum would be \"praised the women's forum for addressing sensitive issues like female genital mutilation\".\n\nBut the example response's propSum is a call to action. Maybe in this case, since she didn't propose a new policy but highlighted an existing initiative, the propSum is about recognizing the forum's work. I need to stick strictly to what's in the summary. The exact quote is \"praised the women's forum for addressing sensitive issues like female genital mutilation.\" So the propSum would be that she praised the forum's efforts in this area.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nissueSum: \"The issue of addressing sensitive topics such as female genital mutilation through the women's forum.\"\npositionSum: \"She praised the women's forum for its efforts in tackling sensitive issues like female genital mutilation.\"\nargSum: \"Her praise is based on the forum's effectiveness in addressing these critical issues.\"\npropSum: \"She praised the women's forum for addressing sensitive issues like female genital mutilation.\"\n\nBut I need to make sure it's concise and in the correct JSON format.

The user provided a debate summary about the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2005 and wants the main points from Alyn Smith's contribution.\n\nFirst, I need to locate Alyn Smith's part in the summary. Scanning through the sections, under the \"Trade Policy and Development Approach\" section, there's a mention of Alyn Smith. The summary states: \"Alyn Smith acknowledged the Assembly's valuable work while criticizing 'our trade policies, which all too often hinder rather than help development' [Smith], calling for 'fair trade partnerships' rather than just aid distribution.\"\n\nSo, the key points here are that Smith acknowledges the Assembly's work but criticizes current trade policies. His position is that trade policies are hindering development. The argument is that existing policies aren't helping enough, and he advocates for fair trade partnerships instead of just aid. The proposal is to shift towards fair trade partnerships.\n\nI need to make sure I don't include other speakers' points. The user specified to only include Smith's arguments. The issue here is the effectiveness of current trade policies. The position is critical of existing policies. The argument is that they hinder development. The proposal is fair trade partnerships.\n\nNow, structuring this into the JSON format as per the example. The issueSum should mention trade policies hindering development. PositionSum states his criticism and call for fair trade. ArgSum explains that his argument is based on trade policies hindering development. PropSum is the call for fair trade partnerships.\n\nDouble-checking that there's no other info about Smith elsewhere. The rest of the summary doesn't mention him again. So the response should be accurate.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The speaker highlighted concerns about the effectiveness of current trade policies in supporting development in ACP countries.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"The speaker criticized existing trade policies for hindering development and advocated for the establishment of fair trade partnerships instead of relying on aid distribution.\",\n\"argSum\": \"The argument is based on the assertion that current trade policies are not adequately supporting development and need to be reformed to create more equitable partnerships.\",\n\"propSum\": \"The speaker proposed shifting towards 'fair trade partnerships' as a more effective approach compared to traditional aid distribution.\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}]
