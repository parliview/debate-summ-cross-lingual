{"speaker": "Mariann Fischer Boel,", "english": "Mariann Fischer Boel, Member of the Commission . Mr President, the rapporteur has produced an excellent report on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly. He has summarised very well all the recent developments of the Assembly. It is indeed becoming an increasingly strong parliamentary pillar of ACP-EU cooperation. The establishment of the standing committees and the joint drafting of reports by the ACP and the EU members of the Assembly have led to more frequent and more intense contacts between parliamentarians.\nThe Assembly has become a mature forum, where issues of concern to ACP and EU parliamentarians are addressed in an open debate where broad consensus on many development issues is emerging and where votes by separate houses have become a rare exception. This framework has allowed the Assembly to discuss and reach agreement on a broad variety of issues ranging from governance over finance to trade questions.\nThe resolution calls on the Assembly to organise meetings between EU and ACP Members of Parliament at regional or sub-regional level to strengthen regional integration and foster cooperation between national parliaments. The Commission is ready to make its contribution to the success of such arrangements.\nIn conclusion, I would like to stress that the Commission shares your view on the Assembly\u2019s role as a model for cooperation. My colleague Mr Michel has participated in all the Assemblies held since he took office. Commissioner Michel also looks forward to attending the next Assembly which will be held in Vienna in June this year.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Mariann Fischer Boel, Member of the Commission .
