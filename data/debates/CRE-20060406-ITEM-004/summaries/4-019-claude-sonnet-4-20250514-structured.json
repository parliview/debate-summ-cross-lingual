I am not sure whether one day we will have the EP meeting the AP\u00a0\u2013 the African Parliament, including, of course, the Caribbean and Pacific\u00a0\u2013 but certainly we must play our part in sustaining and developing that African Parliament concept.\nMy message to the European Parliament is that REACH has shown us how intimately the work of each of us affects that of the other. We had valuable discussions in Bamako and in Edinburgh and this Parliament, I am sure, will take the ACP views into account. Often, however, we legislate for all the right reasons in the European Parliament yet we have not heard the worries of the ACP, because we have not listened. That is why I say to the Commissioner that the ACP is not just for our good friend Mr Michel: it is for all the Commissioners in the College.\nI am very pleased that this House overruled the Presidency of Parliament on the question of where the last JPA should be sited in the European Union. It was right for us to site it in the country holding the Presidency, just as we rotate our meetings in the JPA in the ACP countries. That gives ACP members an opportunity to see different aspects of different policies in Europe, for example the malaria vaccine research in Edinburgh. In the same way, we learned much from seeing the desertification of the Niger; or the implementation of the vaccine fund on the ground in Mali, where we could see the people who are most affected actually benefiting from the work being done. The flu pandemic threat and the avian flu pandemic reality show just how important it is that we continue to work closely together\u00a0\u2013 Europe and the countries of the ACP\u00a0\u2013 for our mutual benefit.\n(Applause)", "lang": "EN", "original": "John Bowis (PPE-DE). \u2013 Mr President, I think we see the ACP relationship as maturing well, which may sound like the description of a long-term mistress, but it is true that we know each other, we understand each other, sometimes we excite each other, sometimes we see each other\u2019s blemishes, but we grow to value each other\u2019s qualities.\nMy message to the ACP is that we still wish on principle that ACP delegates should only be from among members of parliament and not ambassadors, and preferably from government and opposition parties, which would better reflect the balance of the European Parliament\u2019s delegation.
