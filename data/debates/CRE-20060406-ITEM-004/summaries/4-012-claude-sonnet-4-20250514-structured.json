{"speaker": "Marie-Arlette Carlotti,", "english": "Marie-Arlette Carlotti, on behalf of the PSE Group . \u2013 (FR) Mr\u00a0President, the report by my fellow Member, Mr\u00a0Cornillet, illustrates the quality of the work done by the Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2005.\nThe JPA is a permanent forum for political dialogue that tends to become an instrument of prevention, of conflict resolution and of support for the democratic process. The role of the JPA is therefore very precious in the context of the Cotonou Agreements. It is a unique tool for dialogue between the North and the South. In the future, it must work more effectively, particularly in terms of dealing with major crisis situations, such as the one in Darfur, provided that it is given the resources to do so. This aspect is above all the responsibility of the European Union, which must attach political priority to this partnership with the ACP countries, by respecting its commitments in the negotiations under way on the sum of the tenth EDF and by finally refraining from taking back with the one hand what it gives with the other, as illustrated by the sugar reform.\nBy finally giving the JPA the political respect that it deserves, let us thus definitively enforce what is laid down in the Cotonou Agreement, that is to say that the Assembly shall meet in Europe in the country of the EU Presidency. Let us not welcome our ACP partners in a half-hearted fashion, as that would be a downright poor political signal for us to give. However, it is also the responsibility of the JPA itself. It must make progress with its reform and its working methods, and the next development could result in regional conferences being held. This objective could be set by the beginning of 2007.\nFinally, we, as members of the JPA, also have a political responsibility, by abstaining, for example, from voting in separate houses, which is not only the negation of the JPA\u2019s joint character, but also the means used all too often these days for the purposes of thwarting the outcome of a vote. I find all of that in the Cornillet report and I therefore believe that, as far as we are concerned, it constitutes a road map for 2006.", "lang": "FR", "original": "Marie-Arlette Carlotti, au nom du groupe PSE. - Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, le rapport de mon coll\u00e8gue, Thierry Cornillet, illustre la qualit\u00e9 du travail qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9alis\u00e9 par l\u2019Assembl\u00e9e parlementaire paritaire en 2005.\nL\u2019APP, c\u2019est un espace de dialogue politique permanent qui tend \u00e0 devenir un instrument de pr\u00e9vention, de r\u00e9solution des conflits et de soutien au processus d\u00e9mocratique. Le r\u00f4le de l\u2019APP est donc tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9cieux dans le cadre des accords de Cotonou. C\u2019est un outil unique de dialogue Nord-Sud. Et demain, elle doit mieux faire, notamment sur les situations de crise majeure, comme au Darfour, \u00e0 condition qu\u2019on lui en donne les moyens. Cet aspect est d\u2019abord de la responsabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne, qui doit afficher une priorit\u00e9 politique pour ce partenariat avec les pays ACP, en respectant ses engagements dans les n\u00e9gociations en cours sur le montant du dixi\u00e8me\u00a0FED, en arr\u00eatant finalement de retirer d\u2019une main ce qu\u2019elle accorde de l\u2019autre, et la r\u00e9forme du sucre en est une illustration.\nEn accordant finalement \u00e0 l\u2019APP la consid\u00e9ration politique qu\u2019elle m\u00e9rite, inscrivons donc d\u00e9finitivement dans les faits ce qui est mentionn\u00e9 dans l\u2019accord de Cotonou, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire que l\u2019Assembl\u00e9e se r\u00e9unisse en Europe dans le pays qui pr\u00e9side l\u2019Union. Ne r\u00e9servons pas \u00e0 nos partenaires ACP un accueil au rabais, ce serait un bien mauvais signal politique que nous donnerions. Mais c\u2019est aussi de la responsabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019APP elle-m\u00eame! Elle doit progresser dans sa r\u00e9forme, dans les modalit\u00e9s de travail, et la prochaine \u00e9volution pourrait se concr\u00e9tiser par les conf\u00e9rences r\u00e9gionales. On pourrait se fixer cet objectif d\u2019ici au d\u00e9but 2007.\nEnfin, nous, membres de l\u2019APP, nous avons aussi une responsabilit\u00e9 politique, en nous abstenant par exemple de recourir au vote par coll\u00e8ge s\u00e9par\u00e9, ce qui est non seulement la n\u00e9gation du caract\u00e8re paritaire mais aussi la fa\u00e7on d\u00e9sormais trop souvent utilis\u00e9e pour d\u00e9jouer l\u2019issue d\u2019un vote. Je trouve tout cela dans le rapport\u00a0Cornillet et j\u2019estime donc que c\u2019est, pour nous, une feuille de route pour 2006.", "agenda_item": "Work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2005 (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060406-ITEM-004", "intervention_id": "4-012", "summary_english": "```json\n{\n  \"headline\": \"MEP Calls for Enhanced Resources and Political Respect for ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"The speaker addresses the work and challenges of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly (JPA) in 2005, highlighting its role as a forum for political dialogue, conflict prevention, and democratic support between the EU and ACP countries.
