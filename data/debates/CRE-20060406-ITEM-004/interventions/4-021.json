Mr President, I agree with the speakers that the Joint Parliamentary Assembly has become an accepted, respected forum for dialogue. The resolutions adopted by this Assembly sometimes even launch debates that go beyond that forum. Mr Bowis mentioned the resolution on REACH, adopted here in November last year, which has led to a much more focused discussion about the impact of REACH on the developing countries.\nThe next Joint Parliamentary Assembly also promises to be interesting. It will deal with such important issues as the role of regional integration in the promotion of peace and security, the problematic issue of energy in the ACP countries and the social and environmental aspects of fisheries in developing countries. I know from my colleague, Mr Michel, that he is very much looking forward to attending those meetings.\nOn the sugar issue, I am indeed familiar with the issue of funding for the Sugar Protocol countries. We have had this discussion before. I should just like to reiterate that EUR\u00a040 million is available in 2006. What is more important is that we do not forget that the impact of the price drop agreed within the European Union will not have an effect on the ACP countries until 2008. They have another two years to try to adapt their production with the money available from the European Union. You know that considerable funds will be available from 2007 until 2013.\nIn the European Union we have shown that we also have a responsibility towards those countries that will be affected by internal legislation concerning the need \u2013 that I am quite sure everybody feels \u2013 to adapt our agricultural policy to a more global trade.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Mariann Fischer Boel, Member of the Commission .
