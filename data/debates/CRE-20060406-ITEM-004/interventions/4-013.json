{"speaker": "Gerard Batten,", "english": "Gerard Batten, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . \u2013 Mr President, how to help the countries of Africa and other parts of the developing world is a key factor in ensuring a more prosperous and therefore a more stable world.\nWhat Africa needs in particular is respect for the rule of law, respect for contract law and the protection of private property. Under those circumstances there will be economic development and prosperity. This is very hard to achieve when many of the governments are socialist or quasi-socialist or simply kleptocracies. The story of international aid to these countries is sadly one of waste, embezzlement and corruption.\nIf the EU really wants to help these countries, it should not help consolidate corrupt systems through more aid. What it should do is embrace free trade and lower the trade barriers and tariffs \u2013 in fact remove trade barriers and tariffs that are holding back the economic development of these countries.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Gerard Batten, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . \u2013 Mr President, how to help the countries of Africa and other parts of the developing world is a key factor in ensuring a more prosperous and therefore a more stable world.\nWhat Africa needs in particular is respect for the rule of law, respect for contract law and the protection of private property.
