(DE) Madam President, seeing as the summit will be held in Vienna, I should like to say a few words in German: I am delighted at the very broad agreement reached between the three institutions of the European Union regarding the Latin America summit and the issue of Latin America.\nWe have all worked very hard to achieve this, with some excellent preparatory meetings, such as the ministerial meeting on social cohesion in Brussels, meetings on immigration issues and drugs in Cartagena, a civil society meeting in Vienna, a meeting for business that has yet to take place, and, of course, the parliamentary meeting in Dornbirn. All of that means that we now have a broader basis than we have really ever had, and that is very important. Nevertheless, we still have a great deal of crucial work to do over the next two weeks, which, above all, will hopefully take us in a direction that will allow us to launch this association agreement with the Andean Community. I know, in any case, that the Austrian Presidency is putting a great deal of effort into this.\nHowever, summits are always judged according to who attends them. To my knowledge, we have so far received acceptances from 18 Latin American Heads of State or Government. I think it is very important that this considerable display of interest must now be translated into concrete action. We will continue to build on it, because it needs to be the basis of cooperation for the next seven years.\nIn terms of substance, I should also like to say that, in addition to the topics we have dealt with today, the issue of human rights and the strengthening of the institutions will, of course, also be discussed, including the violence against women in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez. I myself raised this issue with the Mexican Attorney-General in person on a recent visit to that country, and I know that he is taking a close interest. With regard to Colombia, too, I would say to you that we obviously support those responsible for human rights there, and also the victims among the population. The official responsible for these women's issues has recently visited both your House and the Commission, and we held very intensive talks on the matter.\nIn general, I think, we have covered a really broad range of issues, but we now need to work together to actually achieve all of it, which will make the summit a real success.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Benita Ferrero-Waldner, Member of the Commission .
