I\u00a0also appreciate the way the President of the European Parliament Mr\u00a0Borrell conducted these discussions in Bregenz, which concluded with the adoption of a\u00a0final joint declaration.\nThe European Union is a key partner for the countries of Latin America, not only in commerce, industry, science and technology, but also from the viewpoint of assistance with the democratisation of society. Cooperation between the two regions has already reached the stage at which it needs to be institutionalised, which is why I welcome the proposal to set up a Euro-Latin American transatlantic parliamentary assembly to promote and extend information exchange and to provide a proper framework for legislative moves in mutual relations. Globalisation has levelled out information inequalities, and has hastened the transfer of information, which is why the human aspect of economic relations needs to be intensified.\nI would like to thank you for including my remarks on the situation for women and their position in these countries. The white slave trade, with the abuse of women and children as prostitutes and the inadequate representation of women in society, is an issue that needs to be resolved not just in Europe, but also in the countries of Latin America. Commissioner, I support the establishment of a bi-regional solidarity fund earmarked primarily for education, eradicating illiteracy and supporting social cohesion. However, I ask that the money should go where it is meant to go, that is to citizens, students, and the younger generation, and not to regimes that have problems with democracy. I wish you success at the summit in Vienna.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Irena Belohorsk\u00e1 (NI). \u2013 ( SK ) Ladies and gentlemen, I\u00a0would like to start by thanking Mr\u00a0Salafranca not just for his report, but also for his constructive approach in the discussions between the European Union and the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean earlier this week.
