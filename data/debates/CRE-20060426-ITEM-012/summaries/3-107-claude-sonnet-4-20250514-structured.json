{"speaker": "Giovanni Claudio Fava,", "english": "Giovanni Claudio Fava, on behalf of the PSE Group. \u2013 (IT) Madam\u00a0President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to Mrs\u00a0Ferrero-Waldner and to Mr\u00a0Salafranca\u00a0S\u00e1nchez-Neyra, whom our group supported and whose work today at the centre of our debate it welcomes. We welcome his report because it is timely, because it is practical and because it has a precious quality: political realism.\nMr\u00a0Salafranca\u00a0S\u00e1nchez-Neyra reminds us that we must eventually adopt a strategic approach to Latin America, a broad outlook that aims to place side by side all the points that matter to us: the social aspect, the economic aspect and the cultural aspect.\nWe must bear in mind that many things have changed in that continent. Major new players have emerged strongly in the social and political spheres; we must take account of these new players, including, of course, the indigenous and mestizo part of society, which until recently was sidelined from the political process.\nWe must realistically consider the fact, too, that regional integration processes often mark time and, from that point of view, our experience can support and help the work being done by Latin American countries. Finally, we must bear in mind, as Mr\u00a0Salafranca\u00a0S\u00e1nchez-Neyra points out, that poverty remains endemic in that continent: 45% of the population live below the poverty line.\nHowever, notwithstanding a few inconsistencies, the income produced by the Latin American continent, in terms of GDP, is equivalent to USD\u00a02\u00a0800, or three times as much as that produced in China. That tells us that Latin America remains a continent with significant economic and income-related disparities, in other words a continent of inequality.\nFrom that point of view, the Vienna Summit represents a great opportunity; firstly, in terms of making up for the scant attention that our institution, the European Parliament, has historically paid to Latin America and, secondly, in terms of investing in a cooperation measure that can genuinely overcome poverty and of preventing the political measures from being reduced to a sum of separate measures. We need the strategic outlook that the Commission is proposing to us and that the rapporteur has been able to take up.", "lang": "IT", "original": "Giovanni Claudio Fava, a nome del gruppo PSE . \u2013 Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, ringrazio la Commissaria e il collega Salafranca, che il nostro gruppo ha sostenuto e di cui apprezza il lavoro oggi al centro della nostra discussione. Apprezziamo la sua relazione perch\u00e9 \u00e8 puntuale, perch\u00e9 \u00e8 concreta, perch\u00e9 ha una qualit\u00e0 preziosa: il realismo politico.\nIl collega Salafranca ci ricorda che nei confronti dell\u2019America Latina occorre avere finalmente un approccio strategico, una visione d\u2019insieme che cerchi di mettere l\u2019uno accanto all\u2019altro tutti i punti che ci interessano: l\u2019elemento sociale, l\u2019elemento economico, l\u2019elemento culturale.\nOccorre considerare che molte cose sono cambiate in questo continente, sono emersi con vigore nuovi protagonismi sociali e politici; occorre tenere in conto il nuovo protagonismo, certamente anche di quella parte di societ\u00e0 indigena e meticcia, fino a poco tempo fa ai margini dei processi politici.\nOccorre considerare con realismo anche il fatto che i processi di integrazione regionale spesso segnano il passo e in tale ottica la nostra esperienza pu\u00f2 essere di sostegno e di aiuto al lavoro che i paesi latinoamericani stanno facendo. Occorre infine tenere in conto, come ricorda il collega Salafranca, che in questo continente la povert\u00e0 resta endemica: il 45% la popolazione vive al di sotto della soglia della povert\u00e0!\nEppure, nonostante alcune contraddizioni, il reddito prodotto dal continente latinoamericano, in termini di PIL, \u00e8 pari a 2800 dollari, ossia il triplo di quello che viene prodotto in Cina. Questo ci dice, che l\u2019America Latina resta un paese con forti disparit\u00e0 economiche e di reddito, un continente diseguale.\nIn questo senso il Vertice di Vienna rappresenta una grande opportunit\u00e0; in primo luogo per recuperare la scarsa attenzione che storicamente la nostra istituzione, il Parlamento europeo, ha avuto nei confronti dell\u2019America Latina, in secondo luogo per investire in un\u2019azione di cooperazione capace di superare davvero la povert\u00e0 e per evitare di ridurre l\u2019azione politica ad una somma di azioni separate. Occorre la prospettiva strategica che ci suggerisce la Commissione e che il relatore ha saputo riprendere.", "agenda_item": "A stronger partnership between the European Union and Latin America (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060426-ITEM-012", "intervention_id": "3-107", "summary_english": "{\n  \"headline\": \"EU must adopt strategic approach to Latin America focusing on social, economic and cultural cooperation to address inequality and poverty\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"The speaker identifies several key issues regarding EU-Latin America relations: the need for a strategic approach that encompasses social, economic and cultural aspects; the emergence of new political players including indigenous and mestizo populations previously excluded from politics; stalled regional integration processes; endemic poverty with 45% of the population below the poverty line; and significant economic inequality despite Latin America's GDP being equivalent to $2,800 USD, three times that of China.\",\n  \"positionSum\": \"The speaker supports the rapporteur's work and advocates for a comprehensive strategic approach to Latin America.
