Together they can be worth much more than the sum of their parts and they can tackle the problems and challenges of globalisation much more successfully. If this is taken into account, the Vienna Summit can succeed. That is the direction we must take.\nFinally, Mrs\u00a0Ferrero-Waldner, let us not abandon the Andean countries just because one of them has cast the Andean Community aside: we cannot reward the country that has boycotted the Community, but rather we must reward those countries such as Colombia, Peru, Ecuador and \u2013 who knows? \u2013 Bolivia, that want to maintain an agreement with the European Union.", "lang": "ES", "original": "Luis Y\u00e1\u00f1ez-Barnuevo Garc\u00eda (PSE). \u2013 (ES) Se\u00f1ora Presidenta, para acortar mi intervenci\u00f3n, quisiera felicitar al se\u00f1or Salafranca, a la se\u00f1ora Ferrero-Waldner y al se\u00f1or Winkler, por el Consejo, por esa confluencia de las tres instituciones, como ellos han dicho, adem\u00e1s, muy brillantemente.\nCreo que la clave del arco de las relaciones de Europa y Am\u00e9rica Latina \u2014y no debemos perder esa visi\u00f3n de conjunto\u2014 es la complementariedad de dos regiones que comparten valores, ideales, historia, cultura, tradiciones y que representan m\u00e1s de 50 pa\u00edses y m\u00e1s de mil millones de habitantes.
