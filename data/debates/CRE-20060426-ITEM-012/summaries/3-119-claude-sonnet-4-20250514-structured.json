I think that those of the 92 points presented that are in our common interest should be selected for rapid implementation. European businesses are investing in the region\u2019s economy, and the European Union provides financial assistance with a view to solving social and economic problems. The Latin American countries achieved GDP growth of 3-4% last year, and are an increasingly large export market not for the European Union, but for Asia. The \u2018economic tigers\u2019 are fighting aggressively for the rich reserves of raw materials that are found in the region, in so doing restricting the chances for cooperation in this field between the EU and Latin America.\nIn addition to resolutions, we should take advantage of our cultural legacy and existing economic links with Latin America to draw up an efficient economic programme, based on common actions and benefits, in order to avoid losing out on the economic benefits of cooperation. As well as reports setting out a vision of future measures, it would appear that a review of the working procedures of EU bodies is necessary, in order to react quickly to changes resulting from the functioning of the global market that work to the disadvantage of our citizens.", "lang": "PL", "original": "Leopold J\u00f3zef Rutowicz (NI). \u2013 Pani Przewodnicz\u0105ca!
