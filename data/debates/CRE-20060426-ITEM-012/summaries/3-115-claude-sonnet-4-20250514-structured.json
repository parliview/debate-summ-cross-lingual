{"speaker": "Luca Romagnoli (NI). \u2013", "english": "Luca Romagnoli (NI). \u2013 (IT) Madam\u00a0President, ladies and gentlemen, Latin America has recently recorded higher growth than expected, and Mercosur, the fourth largest economic area in the world, has certainly played a fundamental part in achieving that outcome.\nStrengthening cooperation between the European Union and Latin America, by prioritising a two-way strategic partnership in political and institutional terms, with the aim of steering economic cooperation and socio-cultural integration between the two continents more effectively, are objectives that the party that I represent and also the common sense of the citizens and governments generally can only share.\nThe European institutions and the Member States, foremost among which are Italy and Spain, together with European businesses, have strong interests in that area, which appears to be one of the growth poles of the world economy. Italy, for example, has more than half of the businesses in Latin America with offices in Mercosur countries. We therefore support the Commission\u2019s intention to broaden the dialogue and the subjects of mutual interest to incorporate the excellent recommendations in Mr\u00a0Salafranca\u00a0S\u00e1nchez-Neyra\u2019s report, while taking care to ensure, however, that the alleged need for greater promotion of trade does not lead to excessive liberalisation, resulting in unfair competition for European industry.\nAmong the objectives of the Salafranca\u00a0S\u00e1nchez-Neyra report are calls to fight poverty. In that regard, I agree with the need to support agricultural reform in South America; just as in Europe in centuries gone by, the dividing up of large landed estates gave a major boost to land cultivation and, in addition to solving the problem of poverty in our continent, it paved the way for its subsequent industrial development. I would therefore be grateful to Mr\u00a0Salafranca S\u00e1nchez-Neyra if he were to expand his report along those lines.", "lang": "IT", "original": "Luca Romagnoli (NI). \u2013 Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, in America Latina recentemente \u00e8 stata registrata una crescita superiore a quella prevista e un ruolo fondamentale lo ha senz\u2019altro svolto il Mercosur, la quarta area economica mondiale.\nRafforzare la cooperazione tra Unione europea e America Latina, dando priorit\u00e0 ad un\u2019associazione strategica bidirezionale, in termini politici e istituzionali onde meglio orientare anche la collaborazione economica e l\u2019integrazione socioculturale tra i due continenti, questi sono obiettivi che il partito da me rappresentato e in generale anche il buon senso dei cittadini e dei governi non pu\u00f2 che condividere.\nLe Istituzioni europee e gli Stati membri, tra i primi l\u2019Italia e la Spagna, nonch\u00e9 le imprese europee, hanno grandi interessi in quest\u2019area, che si prospetta come uno dei poli di sviluppo dell\u2019economia mondiale.
