It strikes me as particularly important that I should point out \u2013 as I did, indeed, in Dornbirn too \u2013 that there will be, in the margins of the summit, a meeting of the most important business leaders from both regions, for it is the entrepreneurs who can help enable Latin America to enjoy greater prosperity.\nI would also like to observe, for Mr\u00a0Pfl\u00fcger\u2019s benefit, that there will also be a large meeting of civil society representatives from both regions, and to that we very much look forward. That, too, is important, for the promotion of civil society in Latin America is one of the European Union\u2019s concerns, and the alternative summit to which you referred will doubtless be a very interesting event, and I hope that it will be well-conducted and peaceful.\nMr\u00a0Romeva i Rueda and Mrs\u00a0Belohorsk\u00e1 raised a topic that is in fact also of particular importance to the Austrian President-in-Office of the Council Mrs\u00a0Ursula\u00a0Plassnik, that being the issue of violence against women and of trafficking in human beings, particularly of women and girls. This matter is one of great importance to the Austrian Presidency generally and will of course be discussed at the Vienna Summit.\nMr\u00a0Ya\u00f1ez-Barnuevo\u00a0Garc\u00eda appealed to the European Union not to abandon the Andean Community, and that is something it will certainly not do. While we are monitoring developments very closely, we do of course have an interest in the sub-regional associations and organisations in Latin America remaining strong, since they are our potential partners, and we hope that the secession of Venezuela, which currently holds the presidency, which has not yet officially been accomplished and has as yet not been confirmed by any council of ministers, will perhaps eventually prove not to be necessary, so that we in the European Union may be enabled to commence negotiations with the Andean Community.\nAs the Commissioner said, there are undertakings to be given by both sides; we in the European Union are prepared to give them, and our Latin American partners must of course be willing to do likewise.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Hans Winkler, President-in-Office of the Council .
