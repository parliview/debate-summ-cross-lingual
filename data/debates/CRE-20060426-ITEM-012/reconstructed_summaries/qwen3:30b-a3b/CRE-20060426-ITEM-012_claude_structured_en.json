Looking through the sections, under the \"Regional Integration Challenges\" part, there's a quote from Luis Y\u00e1\u00f1ez-Barnuevo Garc\u00eda, but then under \"Institutional Framework,\" there's a mention of \"Council President Hans Winkler\" saying something about sub-regional associations. \n\nSo the Council President, Hans Winkler, is mentioned. The user's query says the speaker is \"President,\" which likely refers to him. Now, I need to extract his points. The summary states: \"Council President Hans Winkler expressed hope that strong sub-regional associations would remain intact, noting 'we do of course have an interest in the sub-regional associations and organisations in Latin America remaining strong, since they are our potential partners.'\"\n\nSo the key points here are about maintaining sub-regional associations. The issue is regional integration challenges. His position is supporting the strength of these associations. The argument is that they are potential partners. The proposal is to ensure their strength. \n\nI need to structure this into the JSON fields. The issueSum would be about regional integration and sub-regional associations. PositionSum is supporting their strength. ArgSum is because they are potential partners. PropSum is ensuring their strength. \n\nWait, but the user's example has specific fields. Let me make sure I don't include other speakers. The user said to only include points from the specified speaker.

The truth is that it has been many years since we had a communication with as much strategic vision and as forward-looking as the one that has been presented to us by Mrs\u00a0Ferrero-Waldner, and which is in line with what this Parliament had been calling for since November 2001 on the eve of the Madrid Summit.\nI would like to acknowledge the generosity shown by the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and, in particular, Mr\u00a0Winkler \u2014 who is not listening to me, since he is having a lively chat with Mr\u00a0Voggenhuber \u2014 at the Bregenz meeting yesterday and the day before yesterday, in allowing the European Parliament to address the Heads of State or Government, thereby acknowledging the role that the European Parliament has been playing in terms of promoting the enhancement of relations between the European Union and Latin America.\nThirdly, the members of the Committees on Foreign Affairs and on Development, because they have approved this report unanimously by means of a very unusual vote \u2015 51 votes in favour, 0 votes against and 0 abstentions, and with no amendment to plenary on behalf of the political groups \u2015 which demonstrates clearly the will of the whole of Parliament to back the report that will be put to the vote tomorrow. And not because this is an unambitious report, Commissioner: everybody knows that, as I said before, this Parliament has distinguished itself by being one of the great motors for this relationship and by saying that the decisive factor in moving these relations forward over the coming years is first and foremost political will and giving it clear support. We have therefore made some very clear proposals: we are calling for the creation of a Euro-Latin American Assembly which can give parliaments democratic legitimacy as the promoters and legitimisers of this relationship, and, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we would like the conclusions of the Vienna Summit not just to take account of the will of the parliaments, but also to recommend the creation of that Euro-Latin American Assembly, as happened in the case of the Euro-Mediterranean Assembly.\nWe are also calling for a renewal and updating of the ministerial political dialogue and we recommend the adoption of a renewed bi-regional political agenda, to include new issues: the threats to governability, the fight against terrorism and organised crime, the preservation of the environment and natural resources, bringing together the positions of the Member States of the European Union with those of Latin America in the United Nations, and many other issues which must be enshrined in initiatives such as the signature of a Euro-Latin American charter for peace and security.\nNevertheless, Mr President, political dialogue and political will will eventually run out and come to nothing unless they are accompanied by actions that move us beyond words, and it is in this regard that summits \u2013 and there are too many of them \u2013 fail and are much criticised. One area in which we can clearly move on from words to actions is that of the commercial element of the association agreements. It is clear that we must make progress on the Agreement with Mercosur, since none has unfortunately been made before, though not through lack of will on the part of the European Union: in Vienna we must set a realistic timetable for the conclusion of that Agreement.\nCommissioner, I would like to speak most frankly: in the European Parliament\u2019s view, the time for cooperation and political dialogue agreements with the Andean and Central American Communities has long since passed, and we recommend that the decision be taken in Vienna to move on to the association agreement stage. I am aware that there may be a degree of uncertainty at the moment given Venezuela\u2019s decision to leave the Andean Community, but now more than ever the European Union must send a clear and well-defined message in this direction, in order not to strengthen the position of those people who are against the integration processes.\nI shall end, Mr President, by mentioning two initiatives very quickly, so as not to take up too much time: the Facility of the European Investment Bank, which we would like to take the name of the Commissioner, because of her tenacity, of her having promoted a social cohesion fund that is a complete innovation within the European Union\u2019s history; and an initiative that we do not want to come to nothing: that of the Bi-regional Solidarity Fund, a Fund which is not going to cost the Union any money, because we are not asking for any additional aid, a Fund that is supported by the European Parliament and by our Latin American partners. Though we are not asking for a complete commitment to this Fund, we are asking that it at least be studied and that it can be taken into account in the Summit\u2019s conclusions.\nMr President, the European Union cannot indulge in navel gazing, with a policy of self-contemplation as in the legend of Narcissus: at the Vienna Summit, it must send a clear and well-defined sign of our commitment to a region which expects a lot from us. We also hope that the Commissioner and the Presidency-in-Office of the Council will demonstrate their commitment to ensuring that, through everybody\u2019s efforts, this Vienna Summit is a success.", "lang": "ES", "original": "Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Salafranca S\u00e1nchez-Neyra (PPE-DE), ponente . \u2013 (ES) Se\u00f1or Presidente, se\u00f1ora Comisaria, se\u00f1or Presidente en ejercicio del Consejo, se\u00f1oras y se\u00f1ores diputados, en el inicio de este debate quisiera expresar tres reconocimientos: en primer lugar, mi reconocimiento a la Comisi\u00f3n por la excelente Comunicaci\u00f3n que ha presentado. La verdad es que hac\u00eda muchos a\u00f1os que no ten\u00edamos una Comunicaci\u00f3n con una visi\u00f3n estrat\u00e9gica y una proyecci\u00f3n de futuro como la que nos ha presentado la se\u00f1ora Ferrero-Waldner, y que se sit\u00faa en la l\u00ednea de lo que este Parlamento hab\u00eda venido reclamando desde noviembre del a\u00f1o 2001 en v\u00edsperas de la Cumbre de Madrid.\nEn segundo lugar, quisiera expresar mi reconocimiento a la Presidencia en ejercicio del Consejo y, en concreto, al se\u00f1or Winkler \u2014que no me est\u00e1 escuchando, pues est\u00e1 en charla animada con el se\u00f1or Voggenhuber\u2014, por la generosidad que han tenido, en la reuni\u00f3n de Bregenz de ayer y anteayer, de permitir que el Parlamento Europeo pueda dirigirse a los Jefes de Estado y de Gobierno, reconociendo el papel de dinamizador que el Parlamento Europeo ha venido desempe\u00f1ando en el estrechamiento de las relaciones entre la Uni\u00f3n Europea y Am\u00e9rica Latina.\nY, en tercer lugar, a los miembros de las Comisiones de Asuntos Exteriores y de Desarrollo, porque han aprobado por unanimidad este informe en una votaci\u00f3n muy singular \u201551 votos a favor, 0 votos en contra y 0 abstenciones, y ninguna enmienda al Pleno en nombre de los Grupos pol\u00edticos\u2015, lo que pone claramente de manifiesto una voluntad de todo el Parlamento de estar detr\u00e1s del informe que ma\u00f1ana ser\u00e1 sometido a votaci\u00f3n. Y no precisamente porque se trate de un informe, se\u00f1ora Comisaria, que no es ambicioso: todo el mundo sabe que este Parlamento se ha distinguido, como dec\u00eda antes, por ser uno de los grandes dinamizadores de la relaci\u00f3n y por decir que el elemento decisivo que har\u00e1 avanzar estas relaciones en los pr\u00f3ximos a\u00f1os es, sobre todo y fundamentalmente, la voluntad pol\u00edtica y apostar claramente por ella. Por eso, hemos hecho unas propuestas muy claras: pedimos la constituci\u00f3n de una Asamblea Euro-Latinoamericana que pueda dar una legitimidad democr\u00e1tica a los Parlamentos como impulsores y legitimadores de esta relaci\u00f3n, y nos gustar\u00eda, se\u00f1or Presidente en ejercicio del Consejo, que en las conclusiones de la Cumbre de Viena no solamente se tomase nota de la voluntad de los Parlamentos, sino tambi\u00e9n que se recomendase, como se hizo en su d\u00eda con la Asamblea Euromediterr\u00e1nea, la constituci\u00f3n de esta Asamblea Euro-Latinoamericana.\nPedimos tambi\u00e9n una renovaci\u00f3n y puesta al d\u00eda del di\u00e1logo pol\u00edtico ministerial y recomendamos la adopci\u00f3n de una agenda pol\u00edtica birregional renovada, para incluir nuevos temas: las amenazas a la gobernabilidad, la lucha contra el terrorismo y el crimen organizado, la preservaci\u00f3n del medio ambiente y los recursos naturales, la concertaci\u00f3n de las posiciones de los Estados miembros de la Uni\u00f3n Europea con los de Am\u00e9rica Latina en las Naciones Unidas, y otros muchos temas que se tienen que plasmar en iniciativas como la firma de una Carta Euro-Latinoamericana para la Paz y la Seguridad.\nPero, se\u00f1or Presidente, el di\u00e1logo pol\u00edtico y la voluntad pol\u00edtica acabar\u00e1n agost\u00e1ndose y reduci\u00e9ndose a la nada si no se acompa\u00f1an de unas acciones que nos permitan pasar de las palabras a los hechos, y aqu\u00ed es donde las cumbres \u2014hay un exceso de cumbres\u2014 fallan y son muy criticadas. Y un \u00e1mbito donde podemos pasar claramente de las palabras a los hechos es el de los acuerdos de asociaci\u00f3n, con su vertiente comercial. Es evidente que tenemos que hacer progresos en el Acuerdo con Mercosur, ya que, desgraciadamente, no se han efectuado antes, aunque no por causas imputables a la voluntad de la Uni\u00f3n Europea: deber\u00edamos establecer en Viena un calendario realista para concluir ese Acuerdo.\nSe\u00f1ora Comisaria, tengo que dec\u00edrselo con toda franqueza: desde el punto de vista del Parlamento Europeo, la hora de los acuerdos de di\u00e1logo pol\u00edtico y cooperaci\u00f3n con las Comunidades Andinas y Centroamericanas ha pasado largamente, y recomendamos que en Viena se tome la decisi\u00f3n de pasar a la fase de los acuerdos de asociaci\u00f3n. Yo s\u00e9 que, en estos momentos, con la decisi\u00f3n de Venezuela de dejar la Comunidad Andina, podr\u00eda pesar una incertidumbre, pero, ahora m\u00e1s que nunca, hace falta que la Uni\u00f3n Europea emita un mensaje claro y bien definido en esta direcci\u00f3n, para no dar la raz\u00f3n a los que apuestan en contra de los procesos de integraci\u00f3n.\nTermino, se\u00f1or Presidente, r\u00e1pidamente para no agotar el tiempo, citando dos iniciativas: la Facilidad del Banco Europeo de Inversiones, que a nosotros nos gustar\u00eda que llevase el nombre de la Comisaria, por su tes\u00f3n, por haber favorecido un fondo de cohesi\u00f3n social completamente innovador en la historia de la Uni\u00f3n Europea; y una iniciativa que no queremos que se eche en saco roto: la del Fondo de Solidaridad Birregional, un Fondo que no le va a costar dinero a la Uni\u00f3n, porque no estamos pidiendo ayuda adicional, un Fondo que est\u00e1 apoyado por el Parlamento Europeo, por los socios latinoamericanos. Aunque no pedimos un compromiso al 200 % en torno a este Fondo, s\u00ed pedimos, por lo menos, que sea estudiado y que pueda ser considerado en las conclusiones del acta.\nSe\u00f1or Presidente, la Uni\u00f3n Europea no puede estar mir\u00e1ndose el ombligo en una pol\u00edtica de autocontemplaci\u00f3n como en el mito de Narciso: tiene que emitir en la Cumbre de Viena un mensaje claro y bien definido de nuestro compromiso con una regi\u00f3n que espera mucho de nosotros.

I very much regret the fact that my knowledge of the language is insufficient to permit me to deliver a speech in Spanish, but working alongside the present Commission has been a tough educational experience to which I owe the ability to understand enough Spanish to understand what he said to me, for which I am grateful.\nMy participation in the recent meeting at Dornbirn in Austria was in fact, among other things, an indication of the Council Presidency\u2019s great interest in enhanced cooperation at parliamentary level, and it goes without saying that the European Parliament will be represented at the fourth Summit in Vienna on 12 May, as will the regional and sub-regional parliaments of Latin America. That is a very important dimension of cooperation between the regions, and it is something that we in the Council do of course welcome.\nWe must not lose sight of the fact that this Summit offers a unique opportunity to enhance cooperation, and I can say with a degree of pride that the holding of it was a matter of voluntary choice by the Austrian Federal Government, not least since it would serve as a sign of how important it is to us that this Summit meeting between the EU, Latin America and the Caribbean should, for the first time, be held outside an Iberian or American context. I myself, working alongside the present Commissioner, took part in the first Summit in Rio de Janeiro 1999, and, if we want to draw comparisons between now and then, we have covered a great deal of ground, and that is something we can take pride in. I also particularly want to thank your House and, of course, the Commission too, for the ways in which you and they have helped make this journey a successful one.\nThe Council is entirely of one mind with the European Parliament and the Commission as regards the EU/Latin American partnership\u2019s most important goals and degrees of action, something that is made quite clear in the conclusions adopted by the Council at the end of February, in which the Council reiterated its determination to further strengthen this alliance in the interests of both regions. It is in our interest to enhance this cooperation if we are to promote our common values and interests and to make a joint contribution to peace and security, to the protection of human right and to greater public participation and democracy.\nSocial cohesion, sustainable development, the protection and enhancement of the global environment within the framework of the United Nations are topics on which we have established a tradition of good cooperation with our Latin American partners. I would like to take this opportunity to highlight the good cooperation between most of the Latin American countries and the European Union where the reform of the United Nations is concerned, particularly over recent months. We are also very grateful to those Latin American states that have given remarkable support in reaching the decision on the establishment of a Human Rights Council.\nThe third EU/Latin America Summit in 2004 was held in Guadalajara and saw us making some very ambitious commitments, which, in particular, involve both partners in striving to adopt fiscal and economic measures that will facilitate the improved distribution of wealth and appropriate social policies. The European Union will continue to support these efforts at reinforcing democratic institutions, responsible governance and the rule of law and combating drugs and organised crime, including the trafficking in human beings.\nThe activities engaged in since Guadalajara amount to a very impressive list, of which we, the Presidency of the Council, have taken the liberty of forwarding a copy to your House, for circulation among its Members, and of course to the Commission, since we believe it to be a very important demonstration of what we have achieved in these two years.\nThe European Union is striving for a purposeful political dialogue not only with the region as a whole and with the various integration fora, but also with the individual countries, and Mr\u00a0Salafranca\u00a0S\u00e1nchez-Neyra has made reference to the various negotiations that have started, are due to start, and which we are of course keen to continue. It is to be hoped that one substantial outcome from the Summit will be the beginning of negotiations with Central America. We are in fact somewhat concerned about the future evolution of the Andean Community, in that Venezuela\u2019s recent announcement of its secession from it raises questions that need to be elucidated and answered on both the political and legal level. Only a few weeks ago, I met with the foreign minister of Peru, and we had the opportunity to discuss this issue. I can assure all Members of your House, and you, Mr\u00a0Salafranca\u00a0S\u00e1nchez-Neyra, that we are very much interested in carrying this process forward, although the conditions for that must, of course, be right.\nThinking back to the debates we had in Dornbirn a few days ago, I would like to shed light on a few areas in which further cooperation strikes me as necessary, without wishing to go into detail at the present time. The areas in question are education, training, migration and the protection of the environment, and I believe them to be areas in which further enhanced cooperation will be possible.\nPreparations for the Summit to be held in Vienna on 12\u00a0May are in hand, and good progress is being made with them. It has been possible for senior officials to conduct and indeed conclude very important negotiations, and so we can, overall \u2013 and not least thanks to the help given by the European Parliament and by this report \u2013 be optimistic that the Vienna Summit will be a good one, with real substance and, in political terms, a success.", "lang": "DE", "original": "Hans Winkler, amtierender Ratspr\u00e4sident . Herr Pr\u00e4sident, Frau Kommissarin! Ich m\u00f6chte zuerst Herrn Salafranca S\u00e1nchez-Neyra sehr herzlich f\u00fcr den ausgezeichneten Bericht danken, aber auch f\u00fcr die freundlichen Worte an die Adresse des Rates. Ich bedaure es sehr, dass ich nicht genug Spanisch kann, um eine Rede auf Spanisch zu halten, aber dank der harten Schule, durch die ich als Mitarbeiter der jetzigen Kommissarin gegangen bin, verstehe ich genug Spanisch, um verstanden zu haben, was Sie an meine Adresse gesagt haben. Ich danke Ihnen daf\u00fcr.\nIn der Tat war meine Teilnahme an dem k\u00fcrzlichen Treffen in Dornbirn in \u00d6sterreich auch ein Zeichen daf\u00fcr, dass die Ratspr\u00e4sidentschaft sehr an einer verst\u00e4rkten Zusammenarbeit der Parlamente interessiert ist. Nat\u00fcrlich wird das Europ\u00e4ische Parlament beim vierten Gipfel in Wien am 12. Mai vertreten sein, ebenso wie die regionalen und subregionalen Parlamente Lateinamerikas. Das ist ein sehr wichtiger Aspekt in der Zusammenarbeit zwischen den Regionen, und wir als Rat begr\u00fc\u00dfen das selbstverst\u00e4ndlich.\nWir m\u00fcssen uns bewusst sein, dass dieser Gipfel eine einmalige Chance bietet, eine Verst\u00e4rkung der Zusammenarbeit zu erreichen, und ich darf doch mit etwas Stolz sagen, dass sich die \u00f6sterreichische Bundesregierung freiwillig entschlossen hat, diesen Gipfel abzuhalten, auch als ein Zeichen daf\u00fcr, dass es uns wichtig ist, dass dieser Gipfel EU-Lateinamerika und Karibik zum ersten Mal au\u00dferhalb des amerikanisch-iberischen Raumes stattfinden kann. Ich habe selbst am ersten Gipfeltreffen 1999 in Rio de Janeiro als Mitarbeiter der jetzigen Kommissarin teilnehmen k\u00f6nnen. Wenn wir vergleichen: Von 1999 bis jetzt ist ein langer Weg zur\u00fcckgelegt worden. Wir k\u00f6nnen stolz darauf sein. Ich danke insbesondere auch dem Parlament und selbstverst\u00e4ndlich auch der Kommission f\u00fcr ihre Beitr\u00e4ge zu diesem erfolgreichen Weg.\nDer Rat stimmt mit dem Europ\u00e4ischen Parlament und mit der Kommission hinsichtlich der wichtigsten Ziele und Aktionsebenen der Partnerschaft zwischen Lateinamerika und der Europ\u00e4ischen Union v\u00f6llig \u00fcberein. Das kommt auch ganz klar in den vom Rat Ende Februar angenommenen Schlussfolgerungen zum Ausdruck. Darin hat der Rat seine Entschlossenheit bekr\u00e4ftigt, dieses B\u00fcndnis im Interesse beider Regionen weiter zu st\u00e4rken. Es liegt in unserem Interesse, diese Zusammenarbeit zu verst\u00e4rken, um unsere gemeinsamen Werte und Interessen zu f\u00f6rdern und einen gemeinsamen Beitrag zu Frieden und Sicherheit, zum Schutz der Menschenrechte sowie zur St\u00e4rkung von B\u00fcrgerbeteiligung und Demokratie zu leisten.\nDer soziale Zusammenhalt, nachhaltige Entwicklung, Schutz und St\u00e4rkung der Umwelt auf weltweiter Basis im Rahmen der Vereinten Nationen sind Themen, bei denen wir traditionell mit unseren lateinamerikanischen Partnern gut zusammenarbeiten. Ich m\u00f6chte an dieser Stelle besonders die gute Zusammenarbeit zwischen den meisten L\u00e4ndern Lateinamerikas und der Europ\u00e4ischen Union in Fragen der Reform der Vereinten Nationen, gerade in den letzten Monaten, hervorheben. Wir sind auch sehr dankbar f\u00fcr die gro\u00dfartige Unterst\u00fctzung lateinamerikanischer Staaten beim Zustandekommen der Entscheidung \u00fcber die Einrichtung eines Menschenrechtsrates.\nBeim dritten EU-Lateinamerika-Gipfel 2004 in Guadalajara sind wir sehr ambiti\u00f6se Verpflichtungen eingegangen. Insbesondere streben beide Partner an, steuerpolitische und wirtschaftliche Ma\u00dfnahmen zu beschlie\u00dfen, die eine bessere Verteilung des Reichtums und angemessene Sozialpolitiken erlauben. Die Europ\u00e4ische Union wird diese Anstrengungen weiterhin unterst\u00fctzen, um demokratische Institutionen, eine verantwortungsvolle Staatsf\u00fchrung und Rechtsstaatlichkeit zu st\u00e4rken und Drogen und organisierte Kriminalit\u00e4t, einschlie\u00dflich des Menschenhandels, zu bek\u00e4mpfen.\nEs hat seit Guadalajara eine sehr beeindruckende Liste von Aktivit\u00e4ten gegeben. Wir haben uns als Ratspr\u00e4sidentschaft erlaubt, dem Parlament eine Kopie dieser Liste zur Verteilung an die Mitglieder des Europ\u00e4ischen Parlaments \u2013 und nat\u00fcrlich auch an die Kommission \u2013 zu \u00fcbergeben, weil wir glauben, dass das eine sehr wesentliche Demonstration dessen ist, was wir in diesen zwei Jahren erreicht haben.\nDie Europ\u00e4ische Union strebt einen zielgerichteten politischen Dialog mit der Region insgesamt sowie mit den verschiedenen Integrationsforen, aber auch mit den einzelnen L\u00e4ndern an, und Herr Salafranca S\u00e1nchez-Neyra hat die verschiedenen Verhandlungen, die begonnen haben, die beginnen sollen und die wir selbstverst\u00e4ndlich gern weiterf\u00fchren m\u00f6chten, erw\u00e4hnt. Es ist zu hoffen, dass eines der wesentlichen Ergebnisse des Gipfels der Beginn der Verhandlungen mit Zentralamerika sein wird. Wir sind in der Tat etwas in Sorge \u00fcber die Frage, wie sich die Anden-Gemeinschaft weiter entwickeln wird. Der k\u00fcrzlich erkl\u00e4rte Austritt von Venezuela hat hier Fragen aufgeworfen, die politisch und auch juristisch zu kl\u00e4ren und zu beantworten sind. Ich hatte erst vor wenigen Wochen ein Treffen mit dem Au\u00dfenminister von Peru, bei dem wir diese Frage besprechen konnten. Ich kann allen Mitgliedern des Parlaments und Ihnen, Herr Salafranca S\u00e1nchez-Neyra, versichern, dass wir sehr daran interessiert sind, diesen Prozess weiterzuf\u00fchren. Es m\u00fcssten nat\u00fcrlich auch die entsprechenden Voraussetzungen gegeben sein.\nIch m\u00f6chte unter dem Eindruck der Debatten, die vor wenigen Tagen in Dornbirn stattgefunden haben, einige Bereiche erkl\u00e4ren, in denen mir eine weitere Zusammenarbeit wichtig erscheint, ohne jetzt im Einzelnen darauf einzugehen: Es handelt sich um die Bereiche Bildung, Erziehung, Migration, Umweltschutz. Das scheinen mir Themen zu sein, bei denen eine weitere verst\u00e4rkte Zusammenarbeit m\u00f6glich sein wird.\nDie Vorbereitungen f\u00fcr den Gipfel, der am 12. Mai in Wien stattfinden wird, sind angelaufen und kommen gut voran. Auf hoher Beamtenebene konnten sehr wichtige Verhandlungen gef\u00fchrt und auch abgeschlossen werden. Insgesamt k\u00f6nnen wir optimistisch sein \u2013 auch dank der Hilfe des Europ\u00e4ischen Parlaments und des Berichts, der nunmehr hier vorliegt\u00a0\u2013, einen substanzreichen, guten und politisch erfolgreichen Gipfel in Wien zu haben.", "agenda_item": "A stronger partnership between the European Union and Latin America (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060426-ITEM-012", "intervention_id": "3-102", "summary_english": "{\n\"headline\": \"Austrian Council President emphasizes EU-Latin America cooperation ahead of Vienna Summit, highlighting progress since Rio 1999\",\n\"issueSum\": \"The speaker addresses the upcoming fourth EU-Latin America Summit in Vienna, progress in EU-Latin American cooperation since the first summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1999, ongoing negotiations with various Latin American regions, concerns about Venezuela's withdrawal from the Andean Community, and areas needing enhanced cooperation including education, migration, and environmental protection.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"The speaker strongly supports enhanced EU-Latin America cooperation and expresses pride in the progress made.

The summary says he expressed hope that strong sub-regional associations would remain intact, noting that the EU has an interest in those organizations staying strong since they are potential partners.\n\nSo, the key points here are about maintaining sub-regional associations in Latin America. The issue is regional integration and the importance of these associations. His position is that the EU should support these sub-regional groups. The argument is that these organizations are potential partners, so their strength is important for the EU. There's no specific proposal mentioned, just the hope that they remain strong.\n\nI need to structure this into the JSON fields.

The argument is that they are potential partners. PropSum would be his hope that they remain intact. I need to make sure not to include other speakers' points.

(ES) Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honour for me to be here with you once again today, for the adoption of the European Parliament\u2019s report on a stronger partnership between the European Union and Latin America. I would like in particular to welcome this excellent initiative and to congratulate Mr\u00a0Salafranca especially on the great work he has done on this report.\nAs you know, this report represents Parliament\u2019s response to the proposals made by the Commission in its Communication of 8\u00a0December. I would like to express my most sincere gratitude for the political support that you have given us and for the way that cooperation between our two institutions has been strengthened.\nI believe that, as far as Europe is concerned, the current context is an extremely good one in terms of creating partnership with Latin America. On the one hand, the Council has been most receptive to our Communication and adopted conclusions in this regard at the end of February. On the other hand, the current Presidency sees the success of the 4th European Union-Latin America/Caribbean Summit, which will take place in Vienna on 12\u00a0May, as one of the priorities of its working programme. Thanks to the three institutions, therefore, the Commission has the necessary political support to continue moving forward. And I hope that this represents great progress.\nThis is not enough to make this Summit a success, however. As the English say, 'it takes two to tango\u2019 . While Europe is prepared to commit itself more to Latin America, I also hope that there will be a firm commitment on the part of Latin America. I therefore believe that the Vienna Summit also offers an opportunity to test the will and determination of the Latin American countries and I hope that this is translated into concrete progress.\nI would like to say to you that I very much appreciate the fact that our two institutions are taking the same line, because we are all convinced that creating a stronger partnership is timely, important and necessary for the following reasons:\nFirstly, Latin America is one of the few regions in the world that can be seen as a natural ally to the European Union, particularly given our shared values.\nSecondly, there are many challenges that can be tackled more effectively by means of a reformed partnership and one of them is the lack of social cohesion, which affects both Europe and Latin America. I believe that it is very important that we make more progress in this field and I hope that there are genuine concrete results.\nThirdly, I hope that today\u2019s debate on Latin America sends a positive signal to our partners, assuring them that Europe maintains a strong interest in its region. We need strong, solid and reliable partners in Latin America.\nI would now like to deal with the next issue facing us, which is the Vienna Summit. This Summit is taking place within a context of significant challenges and exchanges, and also changes, in Latin America and the Caribbean. The majority of countries in the region have adopted democratic systems, they have embarked on ambitious economic and social reforms and they have a great potential for development, but unfortunately there are still great social shortcomings, mainly due to the fact that the economic progress has not reached the majority of the population and this is leading, or has led, to a degree of disillusionment with certain democratic governments, as a result of their inability to comply with the terms of the social pact.\nGreat attention has been focussed on the emergence of the new political movements in Latin America, which some see as a direct threat to the traditional political, economic and social structures. These phenomena do not have to be seen in negative terms, but rather we should see them within the context of an evolution aimed at achieving a fairer society. I do not believe that there is any need to stress how important it is for this transition to take place by means of existing and reliable democratic institutions.\nI believe that the Vienna Summit offers an excellent opportunity to achieve this visibility and to hold that dialogue on social cohesion, but also on regional integration and multilateralism. The Bregenz meeting took place within that context and I am very pleased that it has been a real success.\nWe now have to move forward with the establishment of a network of association agreements between the European Union and the countries and regions of Latin America. To this end, I would like to recommend that the Member States firstly negotiate with Central America. This decision still depends upon the Central American countries clearly demonstrating that they are moving forward with their own integration strategy, but I am very optimistic, and I believe that these decisions will be formalised at the meeting of the Central American Heads of State or Government that will take place from 5 to 7 May.\nWith regard to the Andean Community, the situation has unfortunately become more complicated since Venezuela left the Community a few days ago, as we know. I have spoken personally to President\u00a0Morales and we still hope that the internal meetings within the Andean Community can open up a way forward.\nWith regard to Mercosur, I know that the situation is much more difficult, unfortunately, but I still hope that Vienna will at least provide strong political impetus in order to make progress with the negotiations that are running in parallel with the Doha negotiations. We intend to consolidate all of your cooperation in economic and development activities by means of aid programmes and we would like significant support from the European Investment Bank, to the tune of EUR 4\u00a0billion.\nFurthermore, we hope that Vienna will also be an opportunity to announce the creation of a transatlantic parliamentary assembly between the European Union and Latin America. I believe that this will be very important and will also bring the peoples closer together in the future.\nFinally, Madam President, it is the responsibility of all of us to ensure that the alliance between the European Union, Latin America and the Caribbean is stronger and more effective and that it has a long-term future.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Benita Ferrero-Waldner, Member of the Commission .

The user provided a parliamentary debate summary about the EU and Latin America, and they want the main points from Benita Ferrero-Waldner's speech.\n\nFirst, I need to find where she's mentioned. Scanning through the debate summary, under the \"Moving Beyond Political Dialogue\" section, she's cited. The key points here are her support for a pragmatic approach, mentioning that Latin America is a natural ally due to shared values. She also emphasizes mutual commitment, using the phrase \"it takes two to tango,\" meaning both sides need to be committed. \n\nNext, check if there are other mentions. The summary says she supported the rapporteur's pragmatic approach. There's no other info on her positions beyond that. The user wants only her arguments, not others. So, the issue is about strengthening EU-Latin America relations with concrete actions. Her position is supporting practical steps and mutual commitment. The argument is based on the need for both sides to commit. Proposals include association agreements and realistic timetables, but wait, the rapporteur proposed those, not her. Wait, the summary says she supported the pragmatic approach, but the specific proposals like the assembly and agreements are from Salafranca. So maybe her points are more about the need for mutual commitment and acknowledging Latin America as a natural ally. Need to make sure not to attribute the rapporteur's proposals to her. So her position is in favor of moving beyond dialogue, emphasizing mutual commitment. The arguments are based on shared values and the necessity of both parties' commitment. Proposals might not be directly from her, but maybe she endorsed the need for actions. But the user's example includes propSum even if it's part of the speaker's points. Wait, in the example, the propSum was \"He advocates for strict limitations...\" which was part of his position. So here, maybe her proposals are supporting the pragmatic approach, but the specific measures like the assembly were from the rapporteur. So perhaps her propSum is about advocating for mutual commitment and practical steps, but the exact proposals might not be hers. The user's instruction says to include only what's attributed to the speaker. So in the summary, she says \"she supported this pragmatic approach\" and \"success requires mutual commitment.\" So her arguments are that mutual commitment is needed, and she sees Latin America as a natural ally. So the issue is moving beyond dialogue, her position is supporting pragmatic steps with mutual commitment, argument is based on shared values and necessity of both sides, and proposals might be implied in supporting the pragmatic approach. But the exact proposals like the assembly are from the rapporteur. So maybe propSum is not applicable here. Wait, the example has propSum even if it's part of the position. So maybe in this case, the propSum would be her support for the pragmatic approach, but I need to check the exact words. The user's example has \"propSum\": \"He advocates for strict limitations...\" which is a proposal. So here, maybe her proposal is to have mutual commitment, but that's more of a position. Alternatively, maybe there are no specific proposals from her. The summary says she \"supported this pragmatic approach\" but doesn't mention specific proposals. So perhaps the propSum is empty. But the example includes propSum even if it's part of the position. Hmm. Maybe in this case, the propSum would be her support for the pragmatic approach, but I need to structure it as a proposal. Alternatively, maybe there are no proposals from her. The user's instruction says to include only what's attributed. Since the summary doesn't mention her making specific proposals beyond supporting the approach, maybe propSum is empty. But the example includes propSum even if it's part of the position. So perhaps I need to structure it as per the example. Let me check again.\n\nThe user's example for propSum is \"He advocates for strict limitations...\" which is a proposal. In the current case, Benita Ferrero-Waldner's statements are: \"Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner supported this pragmatic approach, noting that 'Latin America is one of the few regions in the world that can be seen as a natural ally to the European Union, particularly given our shared values.' However, she cautioned that success requires mutual commitment: 'As the English say, 'it takes two to tango'. While Europe is prepared to commit itself more to Latin America, I also hope that there will be a firm commitment on the part of Latin America.'\"\n\nSo her position is supporting the pragmatic approach, emphasizing mutual commitment. The arguments are based on shared values and the need for mutual commitment. The issues are moving beyond dialogue and mutual commitment. There's no specific proposal mentioned, just her support for the approach and the need for mutual commitment. So propSum would be empty. But the example includes propSum even if it's part of the position. Wait, in the example, the propSum is a proposal, not just a position. So maybe here, there's no specific proposal, so propSum is an empty string. But the user's example shows that even if the proposal is part of the position, it's included. But in this case, the speaker's contributions don't mention specific proposals, just support for the approach and the need for mutual commitment. Therefore, the propSum would be an empty string. So the final JSON would have issueSum as moving beyond dialogue and mutual commitment, positionSum as supporting pragmatic steps with mutual commitment, argSum as based on shared values and the need for both sides to commit, and propSum as empty.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The key issue raised by the speaker relates to the need for mutual commitment and practical actions to strengthen

We welcome his report because it is timely, because it is practical and because it has a precious quality: political realism.\nMr\u00a0Salafranca\u00a0S\u00e1nchez-Neyra reminds us that we must eventually adopt a strategic approach to Latin America, a broad outlook that aims to place side by side all the points that matter to us: the social aspect, the economic aspect and the cultural aspect.\nWe must bear in mind that many things have changed in that continent. Major new players have emerged strongly in the social and political spheres; we must take account of these new players, including, of course, the indigenous and mestizo part of society, which until recently was sidelined from the political process.\nWe must realistically consider the fact, too, that regional integration processes often mark time and, from that point of view, our experience can support and help the work being done by Latin American countries. Finally, we must bear in mind, as Mr\u00a0Salafranca\u00a0S\u00e1nchez-Neyra points out, that poverty remains endemic in that continent: 45% of the population live below the poverty line.\nHowever, notwithstanding a few inconsistencies, the income produced by the Latin American continent, in terms of GDP, is equivalent to USD\u00a02\u00a0800, or three times as much as that produced in China. That tells us that Latin America remains a continent with significant economic and income-related disparities, in other words a continent of inequality.\nFrom that point of view, the Vienna Summit represents a great opportunity; firstly, in terms of making up for the scant attention that our institution, the European Parliament, has historically paid to Latin America and, secondly, in terms of investing in a cooperation measure that can genuinely overcome poverty and of preventing the political measures from being reduced to a sum of separate measures.

Questo ci dice, che l\u2019America Latina resta un paese con forti disparit\u00e0 economiche e di reddito, un continente diseguale.\nIn questo senso il Vertice di Vienna rappresenta una grande opportunit\u00e0; in primo luogo per recuperare la scarsa attenzione che storicamente la nostra istituzione, il Parlamento europeo, ha avuto nei confronti dell\u2019America Latina, in secondo luogo per investire in un\u2019azione di cooperazione capace di superare davvero la povert\u00e0 e per evitare di ridurre l\u2019azione politica ad una somma di azioni separate.

It is only natural that the new Member States and those states bordering the Union have been, and will continue to be, of the highest priority to us. However, it is important not to forget the rest of the world. Unfortunately, it still sometimes feels as though Latin America has ended up being somewhat neglected, and that is sad. The course of development in Latin America is immensely exciting \u2013 if highly contradictory \u2013 involving economic growth, democratic stabilisation, reconciliation commissions and progress in terms of welfare. Chile has its first woman president. At the same time, a very large sector of the population continues to live below the poverty line. There is great inequality, human rights are violated in many countries, and populists have taken over in Venezuela and Bolivia. In Cuba, Fidel Castro has now been imprisoning opponents, persecuting dissidents and preventing his people from exercising fundamental rights such as free speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of the press and free elections for 47 years. Parliament has debated Cuba on many occasions. My group is very critical of the fact that the Council has adopted a softer line on the Castro regime and that not enough support is being given to the democratic opposition, the representatives of which have twice been awarded Parliament\u2019s Sakharov prize.\nA summit is to take place in Vienna in May between the EU and Latin America. We hope, of course, that it will be a great success. It is important to actually enter into the strategic partnership about which we in this Chamber have talked so many times and for which we have been calling for so long. Such a partnership must be a broad one. We have many areas in which to cooperate including not only politics, the economy, social and cultural issues and so on, but also environmental, research and security policies and, in particular, conflict resolution. We also need to reform our trade policy in order to increase mutual exchange in this area. Cooperation must take place on a long-term and regular basis. Individual summits are important, but they are not enough. As Mr\u00a0Salafranca S\u00e1nchez-Neyra wrote in his report, the parliamentary dimension could be strengthened by a joint assembly. Contact with civil society, for example with students, is also important in order to strengthen cooperation and the sense of solidarity.\nI would like to congratulate Mr\u00a0Salafranca S\u00e1nchez-Neyra on his report. It was adopted unanimously by the Committee on Foreign Affairs and contains many positive and intelligent suggestions that we support. The unanimity with which the report was adopted shows how important it is for the whole of Parliament, irrespective of political groups and despite the slightly differing views on individual development processes, to recognise that we really must deepen this cooperation. The fact that we are so united on this issue is a strength. We wish to see cooperation that is long-term and of high quality and to which priority is given.

This is a very good time do so because, as has been said, Latin America is undergoing certain changes that I believe to be genuinely hopeful. These changes demonstrate that, in some cases, certain groups that have had no voice and practically no rights, are now democratically reclaiming that voice and those rights, and I believe that that is something that we must welcome in any possible way.\nThe rapporteur is aware that we are not in full agreement on the strategy and objectives proposed in the report: there are certain disagreements, which I believe is to be expected in a situation such as this, but certain elements allow us to be optimistic and positive. I therefore believe that we must take a generally positive view of this report.\nI would like at least to comment on three aspects, however. Firstly, for us, the great problem \u2013 and we must continue to insist on this \u2013 stems from the definition of a free-trade area, and that is something we must consider. We would be much more comfortable talking about a global inter-regional partnership.

There's no mention of specific proposals from him, just criticism of the existing plans.\n\nI need to structure this into the JSON fields. \"issueSum\" should capture the main issue he raised, which is the EU's strategic communication serving European capital. \"positionSum\" would state his opposition to the current approach. \"argSum\" is his reasoning, that it's about capitalist interests. \"propSum\" might be empty since he didn't propose alternatives, just criticized.\n\nWait, the example response has \"propSum\" even if there's nothing.

That is how it was and that is how it is now. It is a continent of great creative, artistic, musical and literary inspiration; it is a continent of lively and exuberant faith. It is a continent to which Christians from other continents look with hope. As European politicians, we also look to the region in the hope of close cooperation, and in the hope that we will be able to take advantage of centuries of cultural ties to promote the dynamic development of both Latin America and Europe in all fields.\nI would like to turn now to the Salafranca report. In his report, Mr\u00a0Salafranca has laid the foundations for practical cooperation and has outlined a global policy and a comprehensive vision of a policy of closer economic, security and social ties. The aim of the report is to provide Latin America with European experience in the area of integration, by which I mean common structures, common practices, organs and institutions that function efficiently, programmes that open the way to cooperation with Europe and a willingness to take on the challenges of the modern world together with the EU.\nLatin America is also wrestling with huge problems, however, which include poverty, social inequality, inequality of opportunity, social backwardness, the suffering of the continent\u2019s Indian population, the lack of infrastructure, the power of the drug cartels, gangs of demoralised young people and apathy. In solving all these problems, Latin America should be able to count on the European Union\u2019s help. This does not mean, however, an unnecessary proliferation of EU administrative structures in Latin America. Forms of cooperation should be found that will not result in a multitude of costly new posts in EU representations that are constantly being expanded.\nFinally, I would like to mention one more thing: cooperation should include a clause for the protection of civil liberties and human rights. Latin America is a very sensitive continent in this regard, a fact to which its history testifies. Yet we are currently witnessing dangerous anti-democratic experiments in Venezuela, Bolivia and Communist Cuba. A clause for the protection of civil liberties and human rights must be applied unconditionally.", "lang": "PL", "original": "Bogus\u0142aw Sonik (PPE-DE). \u2013 Pani Przewodnicz\u0105ca!

The task is to extract issueSum, positionSum, argSum, and propSum based on the speaker's arguments.\n\nLooking at the debate summary under \"Moving Beyond Political Dialogue,\" it says that Salafranca set the tone by emphasizing that political dialogue and will need to be accompanied by actions. He proposed creating a Euro-Latin American Assembly, establishing association agreements with the Andean and Central American Communities, and setting realistic timetables for the Mercosur Agreement.\n\nSo, the key issues here are moving from dialogue to action, specific institutional proposals, and realistic timelines.

But wait, the debate summary mentions the Council President, Hans Winkler, and the Commissioner, but the speaker name here is just \"President.\" Maybe they're referring to the Council President?\n\nLooking at the debate summary, under the \"Regional Integration Challenges\" section, there's a mention of Council President Hans Winkler. The user's instruction is to outline the main points of the specified speaker. However, the user wrote \"President\" as the speaker name. I need to check if there's any contribution from the President in the provided debate summary.\n\nScanning through the summary, the Council President's name is Hans Winkler, and he made a statement about sub-regional associations. The user might be referring to him as \"President.\" But the user's input says \"President\" without a last name. However, in the debate summary, the Council President is mentioned once. Let me check if there are other mentions.\n\nIn the \"Institutional Framework\" section, there's a mention of Irena Belohorsk\u00e1 and Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, but not the President. The only other mention is under \"Regional Integration Challenges\" where Hans Winkler is quoted. So perhaps the user is referring to him as \"President.\" But the user's input says \"President\" without a name. However, the user might have made a mistake, but I have to go with the info given.\n\nThe user's instruction says that if there are no points attributed to the speaker, return an empty string. But in the debate summary, the Council President (Hans Winkler) did make a statement. However, the user's speaker name is \"President,\" which matches the Council President's role. So I need to check if the debate summary includes any contributions from the President.\n\nYes, in the \"Regional Integration Challenges\" section, the Council President is mentioned. The exact quote is: \"Council President Hans Winkler expressed hope that strong sub-regional associations would remain intact, noting 'we do of course have an interest in the sub-regional associations and organisations in Latin America remaining strong, since they are our potential partners.'\"\n\nSo the speaker here is the Council President, but the user's input says \"President.\" Assuming that's the same person, I need to outline his points. The issueSum would be about sub-regional associations. His position is supporting their strength. The argument is that they are potential partners. The proposal is to ensure they remain strong.\n\nBut the user's example response has specific fields. So I need to structure that. The issueSum would be the importance of sub-regional associations. PositionSum is supporting their strength. ArgSum is because they are potential partners. PropSum is expressing hope that they remain intact.\n\nBut the user's example has \"propSum\" as a proposal. However, the Council President's statement is more of a hope or statement rather than a proposal. But according to the debate summary, he \"expressed hope\" which might not be a proposal. So maybe propSum is empty? But the user's example includes propSum even if it's a hope. Alternatively, maybe the propSum is the action to ensure they remain strong.\n\nBut the exact quote is \"expressed hope that strong sub-regional associations would remain intact.\" So the proposal is to maintain them. So propSum would be \"expressing hope that strong sub-regional associations remain intact.\"\n\nBut the user's example has propSum as a proposal. So I need to structure accordingly. Therefore, the JSON would have:\n\nissueSum: \"The importance of maintaining strong sub-regional associations in Latin America as potential partners for the EU.\"\npositionSum: \"The Council President expressed hope that strong sub-regional associations in Latin America would remain intact.\"\nargSum: \"He noted that these associations are potential partners for the EU.\"\npropSum: \"Expressing hope that strong sub-regional associations remain intact.\"\n\nBut I need to make sure that the response only includes the points attributed to the speaker.
