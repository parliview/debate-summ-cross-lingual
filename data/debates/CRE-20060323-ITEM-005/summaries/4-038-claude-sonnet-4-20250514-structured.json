{"speaker": "Joel Hasse Ferreira,", "english": "Joel Hasse Ferreira, on behalf of the PSE Group . \u2013 (PT) There is no doubt about the importance of the issue before us. A large proportion of Europe is getting older. With rare exceptions, birth rates are low. Various social protection, solidarity and social security mechanisms have seen their sustainability come under threat. Immigration from countries outside Europe has apparently made it possible to balance activity rates in some Member States, but there are social consequences in terms of social integration and family support that must be taken into account.\nThe debate on demographic challenges has gained fresh urgency, with the advent of the recent Scandinavian implementation of the European Social model. It is very important to combine increased productivity and competitiveness benefits with strong female participation in the labour market. At the same time, birth rates have gone up and there is now more understanding when it comes to paternity leave and greater support for motherhood.\nAccordingly, from a European perspective, all efforts must be channelled into reconciling working life and family life in each Member State, by negotiating more flexible working hours, and by means of more appropriate and more widespread child support infrastructure. In addition, mutual knowledge of different social security systems must be increased and people must be given the opportunity to move freely from one national system to another, be it public, private or any other kind, for example, mutual benefit systems. This is very important for workers who pay social security in a particular Member State, whose lives will improve on their return to their country of origin and when they move to another Member State to work.\nThere also needs to be a drive to modernise social protection systems. Moreover, active ageing should be encouraged. This is all discussed in the reports by Mr\u00a0Bushill-Matthews, Mrs Estrela and all the members of committees working with such dedication in this area. I should like to conclude by saying that the demographic challenges currently facing Europe are serious, but that there are ways of addressing these challenges. Let us therefore rise to the challenge of helping to ensure greater solidarity between the generations.", "lang": "PT", "original": "Joel Hasse Ferreira, em nome do Grupo PSE . \u2013 \u00c9 ineg\u00e1vel a import\u00e2ncia do tema em debate. Boa parte da Europa envelhece. Com raras excep\u00e7\u00f5es, as taxas de natalidade s\u00e3o baixas. V\u00e1rios sistemas de protec\u00e7\u00e3o social, de solidariedade e de seguran\u00e7a social v\u00eaem a sua sustentabilidade mais amea\u00e7ada.

Combinar aumentos de produtividade e ganhos de competitividade com uma forte participa\u00e7\u00e3o feminina no mercado de trabalho \u00e9 muito importante. Ao mesmo tempo, as taxas de fertilidade aumentaram e, entretanto, h\u00e1 maiores facilidades nas licen\u00e7as de paternidade e melhores apoios \u00e0 maternidade.\nNo quadro europeu em cada Estado-Membro \u00e9 assim necess\u00e1rio desenvolver todos os esfor\u00e7os para conciliar a vida profissional com a vida familiar, nomeadamente atrav\u00e9s de uma flexibiliza\u00e7\u00e3o negociada dos hor\u00e1rios de trabalho, bem como de mais adequados e generalizados equipamentos de apoio \u00e0 inf\u00e2ncia. Por outro lado, \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio aprofundar o conhecimento m\u00fatuo dos diferentes sistemas de seguran\u00e7a social, bem como garantir a flexibilidade de passagem de um sistema nacional para outro, seja ele p\u00fablico, privado ou de outro tipo, por exemplo, mutualista. Isto \u00e9 muito importante para os trabalhadores que descontam para a seguran\u00e7a social num determinado Estado-Membro, os quais devem ver a sua vida facilitada quando retornam ao seu pa\u00eds de origem ou quando se deslocam para outro Estado-Membro para um novo posto de trabalho.\nH\u00e1 tamb\u00e9m todo um esfor\u00e7o a fazer para modernizar os sistemas de protec\u00e7\u00e3o social ao mesmo tempo que se deve estimular o chamado envelhecimento activo. Tudo isto foi debatido pelos relatores Bushill-Matthews, Edite Estrela e por todos os deputados das comiss\u00f5es que trabalharam seriamente neste dom\u00ednio.
