{"speaker": "Amalia Sartori (PPE-DE). \u2013", "english": "Amalia Sartori (PPE-DE). \u2013 (IT) Mr\u00a0President, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to thank the rapporteur for this excellent work. For my part, the issues that I wish to highlight are the two major challenges facing us: firstly, an ageing population for whom we want to ensure the best possible, dignified old age and, secondly, a low birth rate. We want the right balance to be restored in our continent between the expectations of women and those of our countries.\nIn order to tackle the first challenge, two policies need to be followed. The first is to do away with any disincentive to extend a person\u2019s working life, and therefore to endorse all policies designed to enable elderly people to remain directly involved in the job market for as long as possible. The second policy is to give the elderly the opportunity to remain within their communities for as long as possible. All social policies should be geared towards this objective: to remain in the family environment and in the surroundings of one\u2019s own home, with residential care used only as a last resort.\nAs regards birth-rate policy, I believe that, as always in life, it helps to have concrete evidence. It must be pointed out that, over the last few years, it was those very countries that took an intelligent approach to drafting new tax policies that went on to obtain good results; one interesting example is France. New tax policies, extensive employment opportunities for women, the opportunity to enter the job market and undoubtedly a new and different quality of services are therefore needed.", "lang": "IT", "original": "Amalia Sartori (PPE-DE). \u2013 Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, ringrazio anch\u2019io il relatore per questo ottimo lavoro svolto. Per quanto mi riguarda, le questioni che voglio mettere in evidenza sono le due grandi sfide di fronte alle quali noi ci troviamo: la prima, quella di un mondo che invecchia e al quale vogliamo garantire una vecchiaia la migliore possibile e dignitosa, e nel contempo la mancanza di nascite; vogliamo che nel nostro continente si riprenda una giusta corrispondenza con le aspettative delle donne e dei nostri paesi.\nPer affrontare la prima sfida \u00e8 necessario seguire due politiche: una \u00e8 abolire qualsiasi disincentivo a prolungare la vita lavorativa, da un lato, e quindi consentire tutte le politiche volte a permettere alle persone anziane di rimanere il pi\u00f9 a lungo possibile coinvolte direttamente nel mondo del lavoro e l\u2019altra politica \u00e8 offrire agli anziani la possibilit\u00e0 di rimanere il pi\u00f9 lungo possibile all\u2019interno della loro comunit\u00e0. Tutte le politiche sociali vanno rivolte a questo obiettivo: rimanere nell\u2019ambito familiare, nell\u2019ambito della propria casa e, solo come estrema ratio , l\u2019istituzionalizzazione.\nPer quanto riguarda la politica della natalit\u00e0, credo che come sempre nella vita aiutino i fatti concreti. Va osservato come in questi ultimi anni, un esempio interessante \u00e8 la Francia, proprio i paesi che hanno fatto di una nuova fiscalit\u00e0 una politica intelligente, hanno poi ottenuto buoni risultati. Quindi nuova fiscalit\u00e0, grandi possibilit\u00e0 di lavoro per le donne, la possibilit\u00e0 di entrare nel mondo del lavoro e sicuramente una nuova e diversa qualit\u00e0 di servizi.", "agenda_item": "Demographic challenges and solidarity between the generations (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060323-ITEM-005", "intervention_id": "4-043", "summary_english": "{\n\"headline\": \"Addressing Aging Population and Low Birth Rates Through Work Extension and Women-Friendly Policies\",\n\"issueSum\": \"The speaker identifies two major demographic challenges: an aging population requiring dignified care and low birth rates.
