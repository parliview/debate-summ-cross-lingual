{"speaker": "Edite Estrela (PSE),", "english": "Edite Estrela (PSE), draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women\u2019s Rights and Gender Equality. \u2013 (PT) I should like to congratulate Mr Bushill-Matthews on his excellent report and on the cooperation that we established in the process of drafting our respective reports.\nIn 2003, the natural growth of Europe\u2019s population was 0.04%. Between 2005 and 2030 it is forecast that some 20 million people will be lost. By 2025, the population of the EU is expected to grow slightly, due to immigration, but then to fall again. Immigration is only a partial solution. Europeans do not have the number of children they want. Studies show that they would like to have 2.3 children on average, but they only have 1.5. This figure is too low for the population to be reinstated.\nAmong the reasons for the low birth rate are: belated or unstable access to employment; difficulty of access to housing; the late age at which parents are having their first child; a lack of tax incentives and family benefits; inadequate parental leave; lack of day-care facilities for children and other dependent persons; the salary gap between men and women; and the difficulty of reconciling family and working life.\nAccording to demographics expert Phillip Longman, in Europe it is conservative Christians and Muslims who are having more children, and this will lead to changes in the make-up of society. What can be done to redress the situation? Phillip Longman makes some suggestions: Sweden has succeeded in increasing its birth rates by raising social benefits and by building day-care centres and cr\u00e8ches. In Italy, it would be helpful if securing a loan to buy one\u2019s own house were made easier, as it is currently very difficult to do so. One thing is certain: in most Member States there is a strong correlation between high rates of female employment and high birth rates, and vice versa.", "lang": "PT", "original": "Edite Estrela (PSE), relatora de parecer da Comiss\u00e3o dos Direitos da Mulher e da Igualdade de Oportunidades . \u2013 Come\u00e7o por felicitar o Sr. Bushill-Matthews pelo excelente trabalho realizado e pela boa colabora\u00e7\u00e3o que estabelecemos na redac\u00e7\u00e3o dos nossos respectivos relat\u00f3rios.\nEm 2003, o crescimento natural da popula\u00e7\u00e3o europeia foi de 0,04%. Entre 2005 e 2030 prev\u00ea-se uma perda de mais de 20 milh\u00f5es de pessoas. At\u00e9 2025 a popula\u00e7\u00e3o da Uni\u00e3o Europeia dever\u00e1 crescer, ligeiramente, gra\u00e7as \u00e0 imigra\u00e7\u00e3o, mas prev\u00ea-se que a partir da\u00ed volte a decrescer. A imigra\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 uma solu\u00e7\u00e3o apenas parcial. Os europeus n\u00e3o t\u00eam o n\u00famero de filhos que desejam. Os estudos revelam que gostariam de ter em m\u00e9dia 2,3 filhos, mas s\u00f3 t\u00eam 1,5. Este n\u00famero \u00e9 insuficiente para a reposi\u00e7\u00e3o da popula\u00e7\u00e3o.\nAlgumas causas da baixa natalidade s\u00e3o o acesso tardio ou inst\u00e1vel ao emprego, habita\u00e7\u00f5es onerosas, tardia idade em que os pais t\u00eam o primeiro filho, falta de incentivos fiscais e de presta\u00e7\u00f5es familiares, licen\u00e7as parentais insuficientes, inexist\u00eancia de estruturas de acolhimento de crian\u00e7as e outros dependentes, diferen\u00e7a salarial entre homens e mulheres, dificuldade de concilia\u00e7\u00e3o entre a vida familiar e a vida profissional.\nPhillip Longman, perito em demografia, revela que na Europa s\u00e3o os conservadores crist\u00e3os e mu\u00e7ulmanos os que est\u00e3o a ter mais filhos, o que vai conduzir a uma altera\u00e7\u00e3o na composi\u00e7\u00e3o da sociedade. Que fazer para alterar a situa\u00e7\u00e3o? Phillipe Logman faz sugest\u00f5es: a Su\u00e9cia conseguiu aumentar as suas taxas de natalidade refor\u00e7ando as presta\u00e7\u00f5es sociais e construindo centros de dia e creches; na It\u00e1lia, onde \u00e9 muito dif\u00edcil conseguir um empr\u00e9stimo, pode ajudar se os empr\u00e9stimos para aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o de casa pr\u00f3pria forem facilitados. Uma coisa \u00e9 certa, existe na maioria dos Estados-Membros uma forte co-rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre elevadas taxas de emprego feminino e taxas elevadas de natalidade e o inverso tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 verdadeiro.", "agenda_item": "Demographic challenges and solidarity between the generations (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060323-ITEM-005", "intervention_id": "4-035", "summary_english": "{\n  \"headline\": \"Europe Faces Demographic Crisis Due to Low Birth Rates Requiring Comprehensive Family Support Policies\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"The speaker highlights Europe's demographic crisis, with natural population growth at just 0.04% in 2003 and a projected loss of 20 million people between 2005-2030.
