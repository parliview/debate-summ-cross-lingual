{"speaker": "Sepp Kusstatscher,", "english": "Sepp Kusstatscher, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . \u2013 (DE) Mr\u00a0President, alongside climate change, demographic change is probably the greatest challenge of the present day. There are very many reasons why our birth rate is falling, with a consequent decline in future prospects for our society.\nI should like to select just one aspect of this extremely complex issue: pension provision for mothers. The work done by mothers, especially those with several children, receives far too little recognition. One of the main problems is that most mothers from the days when mothers could not have or did not want careers because of bringing up and caring for their children are at a clear disadvantage, first in their careers and subsequently in old age.\nIn our affluent society, bringing up and caring for children should be given at least the same recognition as activities in the production and services sectors and should thus count fully towards pension entitlement. The simplest, most comprehensive solution would be an unconditional basic income for all.", "lang": "DE", "original": "Sepp Kusstatscher, im Namen der Verts/ALE-Fraktion . \u2013 Herr Pr\u00e4sident!

Es gibt sehr viele Gr\u00fcnde, warum unsere Gesellschaft immer weniger Nachwuchs und somit auch weniger Zukunft hat.\nIch greife nur einen einzigen Punkt aus diesem \u00e4u\u00dferst komplexen Thema heraus: die Altersvorsorge f\u00fcr M\u00fctter. Die Leistungen der M\u00fctter, vor allem jener mit mehreren Kindern werden viel zu wenig anerkannt. Eines der Hauptprobleme ist, dass die meisten M\u00fctter aus jener Zeit, in der sie aus Gr\u00fcnden der Kinderbetreuung und Erziehung nicht berufst\u00e4tig sein k\u00f6nnen oder wollen, zun\u00e4chst in ihrer Berufslaufbahn und dann im Alter klare Nachteile haben.\nDie Betreuung und Erziehung von Kindern sollte in unserer Wohlstandsgesellschaft zumindest den gleichen Stellenwert haben wie T\u00e4tigkeiten in Produktion und Dienstleistung und soll somit f\u00fcr die Rentenbiografie voll anerkannt werden.
