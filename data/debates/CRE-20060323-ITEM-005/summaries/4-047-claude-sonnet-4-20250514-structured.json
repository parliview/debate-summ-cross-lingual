The younger generation works long days for a pittance, causing physical and mental weariness. What is presented as their free choice is actually forced upon them by the \u2018winner takes all\u2019 society. Wage slavery or unemployment, climbing the career ladder or having the door slammed in your face \u2013 these are the choices faced by our highly qualified young people.\nWhen, in spite of the law, a person works 12 hours a day and more, neither flexible working hours nor longer opening hours in the sales and services sector can help. There is simply no time for private life or having children.\nFrom the macroeconomic point of view, this arises from the need to finance the older generation\u2019s anticipated pensions and medical treatment, which is becoming increasingly expensive. This report should just be a starting point. Maintaining the high standard of living in Europe requires politicians to do a lot of extra work, and to act quickly.\nThank you for your attention.", "lang": "ET", "original": "Marianne Mikko (PSE). \u2013 Kallid kolleegid, raport\u00f6\u00f6r.
