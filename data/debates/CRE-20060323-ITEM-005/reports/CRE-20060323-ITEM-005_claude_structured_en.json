(CS) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Bushill-Matthews, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Women\u2019s Rights and Gender Equality for their report, which is truly inspiring. I am delighted at the support that Parliament has expressed for our Green Paper. Parliament\u2019s report has come at the right time to provide a boost to the work of the Commission in respect of the new communication on demographics, since we will be finalising this communication over the next few weeks, and the timing therefore allows us to make use of your report in a very practical way. The report includes a number of highly important points that merit a place in the new communication, which draws conclusions from the responses we received to our Green Paper and from impact studies financed through the pilot action which the European Parliament organised. It sets out the possibilities for continuing cooperation at a European level over demographic issues.\nLadies and gentlemen, in recent times Europe has achieved some extraordinary successes. I would like to state this unequivocally, so that we may bear it in mind. The demographic ageing of our society is an outcome of this success in respect of two of the corners of the population pyramid and two locations on the pyramid. Average life expectancy has increased through the enormous advances in medicine, which have, for example, largely overcome cardiovascular diseases, thereby making a significant contribution to average life expectancy for middle-aged persons. Thanks to major medical advances in the area of child care and peri-natal care, the figures for child and infant mortality have fallen to levels never before seen in history and probably unexpected up to even a few decades ago. This is an unquestionable success. In a manner of speaking, we now enjoy twice as much life as our forbears. And I was delighted to discover, during the course of discussions with the insurance companies, that they are now working from mortality tables that go up not to 80, but to 120 years.\nThis success has its consequences, of course, since demographic ageing alters our entire society across all areas. It is important to realise that a holistic response is required, an integrated and all-inclusive response. Demographic ageing goes beyond the issues of pension systems, health, education, urban planning and so on. In fact, I doubt whether we could find any area of human activity that is not affected by demographic ageing, including the armed forces. We must therefore strive to ensure that active ageing becomes a reality. We must develop our care services for children and the elderly. We must develop new products and services in order to respond better to the needs of ageing individuals, and of course the needs of a society that will be ageing overall, as its age profile alters. We must finally invest more in developing and retaining our human capital in such a way that we achieve high levels of employment and enable the elderly to remain active in the workforce for longer. In the responses to the Green Paper consultations, especially in the responses of the Member States, great emphasis was placed on the need for better harmonisation of our private, family and professional lives.\nIt is already the case that migrants are reversing patterns of demographic decline in some Member States. In order to have a truly beneficial effect, migration must go hand in hand with greater efforts at integration and overcoming differences. Despite all of this, ladies and gentlemen, it remains clear that the migrants on whom we are counting as a permanent feature of our societies in the future do not represent the answer to the problems of demographic ageing. They are one of the components, but they should never be regarded as the solution.\nI would like to mention some of the issues that should be included in our programme of work over the coming years. We would like to renew our focus on harmonising family and professional life, as it is clear that European citizens want to have more children than they currently have. And in order for their natural longings and wishes to be fulfilled, we must in my view take a profound look at our society as a whole, our habits, our ways of doing things and the practices we employ. We would like to set up a European forum on population and demographics, enabling us to understand better the various aspects involved in incorporating a demographic dimension into individual policies, and supported by recognised experts in the field as well as voluntary organisations. In 2007 the Commission will be presenting a report on the measures taken by Member States to incorporate into their national legislation the provisions of Directive 2007/78/EC relating to age discrimination. Every two years, coinciding with the plenary sittings of the forum, the Commission will publish a report on population and demographics in Europe, which will describe demographic trends in Europe in the context of developments worldwide.\nLadies and gentlemen, the added value of Europe consists largely in organising the exchange of information, comparing proven approaches and presenting and disseminating the resulting data. We are already doing this in many areas, especially those areas relating to the Lisbon Strategy. Ladies and gentlemen, demographic developments are changing our society. They have changed it throughout history and will continue to do so in the future. Our society is becoming technically older in demographic terms, but we can also say with certainty that it is becoming wiser, as wisdom is related to experience and is in all societies a characteristic of those who have enjoyed good fortune, living long enough to have the opportunity to draw on their experiences. In our debates I feel that we shall find ways to respond to the challenges arising from the enormous success of our society in prolonging life and raising the quality of life, and we shall do it in such a way that future generations will follow the course that we plot, a course that will involve a more profound sense of the quality of life, the human dimension and the social values that we all cherish.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Vladim\u00edr \u0160pidla, Member of the Commission .

I would say to Commissioner\u00a0\u0160pidla that, personally, I would gladly live for 120\u00a0years. I need to reach 116 to break even on my pension scheme.\nI am surprised that the Green Paper on demographic change does not take greater account of health aspects. The problems of an ageing society are not limited to economic aspects. New syndromes are coming to the fore, as can already be seen: dementia \u2013 be it Alzheimer\u2019s disease or subcortical dementia \u2013 vascular disease, from coronary heart disease to renal insufficiency, metabolic diseases \u2013 diabetes, first and foremost \u2013 arthritis of the spine and the large joints, and osteoporosis, to name but a few. This makes it all the more a question of prevention, of ensuring good living conditions for all before treatment and, if treatment should be necessary, of ensuring that this is as good as possible for all Europeans. It is a case of maintaining both quality of life and mobility.\nWe need social reorientation in order to meet these challenges. Retirement now comprises one third of the human lifespan. We need meaningful employment, social tasks, fulfilling tasks for older people, barrier-free living, new forms of housing, and, if necessary, excellent nursing care and medical care.\nHowever, I would take issue with the implicit and unreflective assumption in the Green Paper that a decline in population would have exclusively negative consequences for the established social system. I should therefore like to see the following issues addressed: the extent to which the negative consequences of a population decline may be addressed by innovation, higher rates of employment and modernisation of social protection; whether there may also be positive aspects to the decline in population, for example on issues relating to the environment, traffic congestion and land development; and whether a \u2018Pareto optimum\u2019 for Europe\u2019s population size may ultimately be established.", "lang": "DE", "original": "Thomas Ulmer (PPE-DE), Verfasser der Stellungnahme des mitberatenden Ausschusses f\u00fcr Umweltfragen, Volksgesundheit und Lebensmittelsicherheit . \u2013 Frau Pr\u00e4sidentin, Herr Kommissar, meine sehr verehrten Damen und Herren! Zun\u00e4chst herzlichen Dank an Herrn Bushill-Matthews f\u00fcr den ausgezeichneten Bericht. Ein Wort zu Herrn \u0160pidla: Ich pers\u00f6nlich begr\u00fc\u00dfe das 120-j\u00e4hrige Leben. Ich muss 116 werden, bis ich bei meiner Rentenversicherung den Break-even- Punkt erreicht habe.\nIch bin \u00fcberrascht, dass im Gr\u00fcnbuch f\u00fcr den demografischen Wandel die gesundheitlichen Aspekte nicht st\u00e4rker ber\u00fccksichtigt wurden. Eine alternde Gesellschaft ist nicht auf wirtschaftliche Aspekte beschr\u00e4nkt. Es treten, wie jetzt schon erkennbar, neue Krankheitsbilder in den Vordergrund: die Demenzen \u2013 sei es Alzheimer oder die subkortikale Demenz\u00a0\u2013, die Gef\u00e4\u00dfkrankheiten von der koronaren Herzkrankheit bis zur Niereninsuffizienz, die Stoffwechselkrankheiten \u2013 hier in erster Linie Diabetes\u00a0\u2013, die Arthrosen der Wirbels\u00e4ule und der gro\u00dfen Gelenke, die Osteoporose, um nur einige zu nennen. Hier gilt umso mehr: Pr\u00e4vention, Vorbeugung, gute Lebensbedingungen f\u00fcr alle vor der Behandlung, und wenn eine Behandlung erforderlich wird, f\u00fcr alle Europ\u00e4er die bestm\u00f6gliche. Es geht hier sowohl um den Erhalt der Lebensqualit\u00e4t als auch um den Erhalt der Mobilit\u00e4t.\nWir brauchen eine gesellschaftliche Neuorientierung, um den Herausforderungen zu begegnen. Der Ruhestand macht inzwischen ein Drittel des gesamten Lebens aus.

Between 2005 and 2030 it is forecast that some 20 million people will be lost. By 2025, the population of the EU is expected to grow slightly, due to immigration, but then to fall again. Immigration is only a partial solution. Europeans do not have the number of children they want. Studies show that they would like to have 2.3 children on average, but they only have 1.5. This figure is too low for the population to be reinstated.\nAmong the reasons for the low birth rate are: belated or unstable access to employment; difficulty of access to housing; the late age at which parents are having their first child; a lack of tax incentives and family benefits; inadequate parental leave; lack of day-care facilities for children and other dependent persons; the salary gap between men and women; and the difficulty of reconciling family and working life.\nAccording to demographics expert Phillip Longman, in Europe it is conservative Christians and Muslims who are having more children, and this will lead to changes in the make-up of society. What can be done to redress the situation? Phillip Longman makes some suggestions: Sweden has succeeded in increasing its birth rates by raising social benefits and by building day-care centres and cr\u00e8ches. In Italy, it would be helpful if securing a loan to buy one\u2019s own house were made easier, as it is currently very difficult to do so.

A large proportion of Europe is getting older. With rare exceptions, birth rates are low. Various social protection, solidarity and social security mechanisms have seen their sustainability come under threat. Immigration from countries outside Europe has apparently made it possible to balance activity rates in some Member States, but there are social consequences in terms of social integration and family support that must be taken into account.\nThe debate on demographic challenges has gained fresh urgency, with the advent of the recent Scandinavian implementation of the European Social model. It is very important to combine increased productivity and competitiveness benefits with strong female participation in the labour market. At the same time, birth rates have gone up and there is now more understanding when it comes to paternity leave and greater support for motherhood.\nAccordingly, from a European perspective, all efforts must be channelled into reconciling working life and family life in each Member State, by negotiating more flexible working hours, and by means of more appropriate and more widespread child support infrastructure. In addition, mutual knowledge of different social security systems must be increased and people must be given the opportunity to move freely from one national system to another, be it public, private or any other kind, for example, mutual benefit systems. This is very important for workers who pay social security in a particular Member State, whose lives will improve on their return to their country of origin and when they move to another Member State to work.\nThere also needs to be a drive to modernise social protection systems. Moreover, active ageing should be encouraged. This is all discussed in the reports by Mr\u00a0Bushill-Matthews, Mrs Estrela and all the members of committees working with such dedication in this area.

Isto \u00e9 muito importante para os trabalhadores que descontam para a seguran\u00e7a social num determinado Estado-Membro, os quais devem ver a sua vida facilitada quando retornam ao seu pa\u00eds de origem ou quando se deslocam para outro Estado-Membro para um novo posto de trabalho.\nH\u00e1 tamb\u00e9m todo um esfor\u00e7o a fazer para modernizar os sistemas de protec\u00e7\u00e3o social ao mesmo tempo que se deve estimular o chamado envelhecimento activo.

For my part, the issues that I wish to highlight are the two major challenges facing us: firstly, an ageing population for whom we want to ensure the best possible, dignified old age and, secondly, a low birth rate. We want the right balance to be restored in our continent between the expectations of women and those of our countries.\nIn order to tackle the first challenge, two policies need to be followed. The first is to do away with any disincentive to extend a person\u2019s working life, and therefore to endorse all policies designed to enable elderly people to remain directly involved in the job market for as long as possible. The second policy is to give the elderly the opportunity to remain within their communities for as long as possible. All social policies should be geared towards this objective: to remain in the family environment and in the surroundings of one\u2019s own home, with residential care used only as a last resort.\nAs regards birth-rate policy, I believe that, as always in life, it helps to have concrete evidence. It must be pointed out that, over the last few years, it was those very countries that took an intelligent approach to drafting new tax policies that went on to obtain good results; one interesting example is France.

It is evident that neither the Millennium Development Goals nor the fight against world poverty feature even remotely in our debate on demographic change. After all, the main problem is not that the European population is declining, but that, firstly, this is disproportional from region to region; secondly, coexistence in society is at risk; and, thirdly, we are not relating demographic change in Europe to the exploding world population.\nWe are looking at the ageing of European society almost exclusively from the point of view of the dwindling workforce and, in the process, completely disregarding the development of productivity. At the same time, we are exploiting productivity as a means to cut social, sickness, health and pension benefits and to consider prolonging working life greatly. I am referring here only to the study prepared and published by the Commission, which envisages 71 years.\nI call for a change in priorities. We need a child-friendly society, which actually welcomes living with children. We need a different kind of debate, as we cannot just see children as an investment to safeguard labour and pension provision. Furthermore, we cannot continue simply seeking a better reconciliation of working life and family life, of working time and leisure time. We need to concern ourselves with something more: with the children, for it is they who are important here. Children must really be central, and must be regarded as individuals.\nNaturally, society also needs to meet the challenges of ageing, for example by means of expanding social services or, of course, by means of urban development: for example, old people\u2019s housing, and transport designed with children and the elderly in mind.

Identifying these obstacles and those which exist both inside and outside the workplace (such as taxation, housing and the cost of education, health and insurance) is the responsibility of the Member States, given that the Member States alone shape both development and family policy.\nHistorically, of course, immigration has often resolved the problem of renewing the population and today it fills the gap created by our choice to have no children or just one child at an advanced age. What has brought us to these life choices in times of peace and opulence? Seeking the causes of demographic change is not the concern either of the European Commission or of the governments. It does not fall within the competences of the European Union; it falls within the competence of each European citizen who wants to go beyond his human capabilities, both in planning the beginning of life and in imposing its end.\nCertainly education, training and finding work in an environment of sustainable development are necessary preconditions to a high standard of living.

(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for a debate which has shown that demography is one of the most important issues facing Europe today, and which has shed light on the issue in many ways. I feel that we have had clear confirmation of the basic view that this is a matter of fundamental change, requiring a holistic or mainstream approach, as has been stated. At the same time, consideration has been given to various aspects of the wider problem. For example, it was stated that the Green Paper does not pay equal attention to two sets of problems, which is to say the problems in respect of the health sector and the problems in an international context. You may have noted from my report that the international context is to be covered in the regular reports, since from this standpoint a specific preliminary response already exists. The question of health is one of the most fundamental of all and I feel that the debate has inspired us to develop our thinking in this area further in the future.\nThis problem raises not only technical and organisational issues, but also a whole raft of ethical issues, since an ageing population will increasingly create situations where people are living in extreme circumstances through a combination of fate and their personal state of health. This means that an appropriate ethical response will be very difficult to find, requiring a great deal of profound reflection.\nI think it was also clear that one issue on which attention was focused, in my view justifiably, was the question of children and the very low birth rate and how we might change or at least influence this. It also emerged clearly from the debate that that this was a general European question, since despite the fact that Ireland, for example, has at present the highest number of live childbirths per woman of childbearing age, it has also recorded a decline over the past 20 years sharper than just about any other country, and the current level is not sufficient to maintain demographic stability. There are, of course, other states which are in a far worse position and where the situation might become extremely difficult within a few generations.\nIt is also clear that we must give very serious consideration to the fact that not every society is people friendly. There is an old Roman saying \u2018Inter arma silent Musae\u2019, in other words when society is under any kind of stress or in an extreme situation, creativity suffers. In my view, having children is a matter of profound need and profound desire.

(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for a debate which has shown that demography is one of the most important issues facing Europe today, and which has shed light on the issue in many ways. I feel that we have had clear confirmation of the basic view that this is a matter of fundamental change, requiring a holistic or mainstream approach, as has been stated. At the same time, consideration has been given to various aspects of the wider problem. For example, it was stated that the Green Paper does not pay equal attention to two sets of problems, which is to say the problems in respect of the health sector and the problems in an international context. You may have noted from my report that the international context is to be covered in the regular reports, since from this standpoint a specific preliminary response already exists. The question of health is one of the most fundamental of all and I feel that the debate has inspired us to develop our thinking in this area further in the future.\nThis problem raises not only technical and organisational issues, but also a whole raft of ethical issues, since an ageing population will increasingly create situations where people are living in extreme circumstances through a combination of fate and their personal state of health. This means that an appropriate ethical response will be very difficult to find, requiring a great deal of profound reflection.\nI think it was also clear that one issue on which attention was focused, in my view justifiably, was the question of children and the very low birth rate and how we might change or at least influence this. It also emerged clearly from the debate that that this was a general European question, since despite the fact that Ireland, for example, has at present the highest number of live childbirths per woman of childbearing age, it has also recorded a decline over the past 20 years sharper than just about any other country, and the current level is not sufficient to maintain demographic stability. There are, of course, other states which are in a far worse position and where the situation might become extremely difficult within a few generations.\nIt is also clear that we must give very serious consideration to the fact that not every society is people friendly. There is an old Roman saying \u2018Inter arma silent Musae\u2019, in other words when society is under any kind of stress or in an extreme situation, creativity suffers. In my view, having children is a matter of profound need and profound desire. Educating children and caring for them is also, in its way, an activity that requires very high levels of creativity, and it is clear that European citizens, if they are to decide in favour of having children, need greater security in a world that is undergoing enormous change.\nThe debate also touched on questions of gender balance, in my view justifiably.

Debate Information\n\n**Topic:** Demographic challenges and solidarity between the generations (debate)  \n**Number of Contributions:** 24 speakers participated in the debate  \n**Date:** Not specified in the provided materials  \n**Context:** European Parliamentary debate addressing Europe's demographic crisis and intergenerational solidarity\n\n## 2. Executive Summary\n\n### Core Issues Identified\n\nThe debate centered on Europe's severe demographic crisis, characterized by two primary challenges: declining birth rates (below replacement levels across all EU Member States) and rapidly aging populations. As Edite Estrela noted, \"Europeans do not have the number of children they want. Studies show that they would like to have 2.3 children on average, but they only have 1.5.\" The mathematical implications are stark - fewer working-age people cannot adequately support growing pensioner populations, threatening social security systems and economic sustainability.\n\n### Positions and Arguments\n\n**Pro-Active Policy Intervention Position:** The majority of speakers, including rapporteur Philip Bushill-Matthews, supported urgent, comprehensive action at both EU and national levels. Bushill-Matthews emphasized that \"these are not just problems for young people, these too are problems for society as a whole. They are challenges for governments; they are challenges for businesses.\" This group argued for holistic approaches combining family support, work-life balance improvements, and immigration policies.\n\n**Health and Aging Focus:** Thomas Ulmer advocated for a health-centered approach, noting that \"retirement now comprises one third of the human lifespan. We need meaningful employment, social tasks, fulfilling tasks for older people.\" He questioned assumptions about population decline, suggesting some environmental benefits might exist.\n\n**National Sovereignty Position:** Nils Lundgren strongly opposed EU-level solutions, arguing that \"which routes individual Member States choose within significant specialist areas of politics must be determined through national democratic processes and not imposed from above.\"\n\n**Social Justice Perspective:** Speakers like Ilda Figueiredo and Gabriele Zimmer argued for fundamental economic system changes, with Zimmer insisting \"children must really be central, and must be regarded as individuals\" rather than economic factors.\n\n### Key Policy Proposals\n\n**Family Support Measures:** Multiple speakers proposed comprehensive family policies modeled on successful examples like Sweden and France. Roselyne Bachelot-Narquin highlighted that \"family policies are effective, citing France as a successful example with tax incentives, parental leave, financial assistance, and childcare provision.\"\n\n**Work-Life Balance Solutions:** Widespread support emerged for flexible working arrangements, with Joel Hasse Ferreira proposing \"negotiating more flexible working hours, expanding appropriate childcare support infrastructure, and modernizing social protection systems.\"\n\n**Immigration Integration:** Several speakers, including Struan Stevenson, supported selective immigration policies: \"attracting skilled workers from third countries based on needed talents\" while ensuring integration and European value acceptance.\n\n**Gender Equality:** Commissioner Vladim\u00edr \u0160pidla highlighted caregiving imbalances, noting that \"in Spain men devote 52 million hours a year to taking care of dependent persons... Women devote 200 million hours a year to this type of care.\"\n\n**Rural and Community Support:** Marian Harkin emphasized enabling aging in place, advocating for \"assisted-living housing models that allow seniors to age in place within their communities\" as \"true intergenerational solidarity.\"\n\n### Economic and Social Arguments\n\n**Economic Necessity:** Multiple speakers referenced the principle that economic growth requires population growth. Kathy Sinnott cited the Commission's position that \"there is no economic growth without population growth,\" using Ireland's pro-life policies as an example of demographic and economic success.\n\n**Urgency of Action:** Marianne Mikko delivered perhaps the most dramatic warning: \"If we continue to occupy ourselves merely with everyday politics, Europe will be hit by a demographic and social catastrophe on the scale of the Asian tsunami.\"\n\n**Systemic Solutions:** Speakers like Amalia Sartori and Karin J\u00f6ns proposed mainstreaming demographic considerations across all policy areas, with J\u00f6ns advocating for \"introducing demographic change impact assessment into the mainstream of all policy fields at national and European level.\"\n\n### Conclusions and Recommendations\n\nThe debate revealed broad consensus on the severity of Europe's demographic crisis but divergent views on solutions. Most speakers supported multi-faceted approaches combining improved family support, flexible labor markets, gender equality measures, and managed immigration. The Commission's Vladim\u00edr \u0160pidla emphasized the need for \"holistic or mainstream approach to addressing demographic challenges\" and creating \"more people-friendly societies that provide greater security for citizens deciding to have children.\"\n\nThe debate highlighted that demographic challenges transcend traditional political boundaries, requiring long-term thinking beyond electoral cycles. As Struan Stevenson noted, \"The problem with politicians nowadays is that we only think in five-year time frames. It is not seen as politically expedient to deal with matters that will have a dramatic impact on our lives ten or twenty years down the line.\"", "src_model": "claude", "model_type": "claude", "model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "structured": true, "incremental": false, "hierarchical": false, "grouped": false, "shuffle": false, "prompt": false, "lang": "english"}
