So, the answer should be an empty JSON object. But I need to make sure there's no part of the summary where the President is mentioned.

The user provided a debate summary about demographic challenges and intergenerational solidarity in the European Parliament. The task is to extract the main points made by Philip Bushill-Matthews (PPE-DE) based on the given summary.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the debate summary and find any mentions of Philip Bushill-Matthews. The user specified that I should only include points attributed to him, so I need to be careful not to include others' contributions.\n\nLooking at the \"Positions and Arguments\" section, there's a mention of Philip Bushill-Matthews: \"Bushill-Matthews emphasized that 'these are not just problems for young people, these too are problems for society as a whole. They are challenges for governments; they are challenges for businesses.'\" So his position is that the demographic issues affect everyone, not just the young, and that both governments and businesses need to address them.\n\nIn the \"Key Policy Proposals\" section, under \"Pro-Active Policy Intervention Position,\" it says the majority of speakers, including Bushill-Matthews, supported urgent, comprehensive action at EU and national levels. However, the specific proposals might not be directly attributed to him. The example given for proposals is from Roselyne Bachelot-Narquin about family policies, but Bushill-Matthews' part is about the need for action.\n\nIn the \"Economic and Social Arguments\" section, there's no mention of him. The \"Conclusions and Recommendations\" section mentions the Commission's \u0160pidla but not Bushill-Matthews.\n\nSo, the main points from Bushill-Matthews are his emphasis on the societal impact of demographic issues and the need for comprehensive action involving governments and businesses. There's no specific proposal mentioned directly from him, just the general support for proactive policies. The arguments he used are that it's a societal problem requiring collective effort. The issues he raised are the demographic crisis affecting all generations.\n\nNow, structuring this into the required JSON format. The issueSum would be the demographic crisis and intergenerational solidarity. PositionSum is his stance that it's a societal challenge for governments and businesses. ArgSum is the reasoning that it's not just for the young. PropSum might not have specific proposals, so maybe leave it empty or note the general call for action. Wait, the example response includes propSum even if it's a general call. The user's example had \"He advocates for strict limitations...\" so maybe here, since he supported comprehensive action, we can say he proposed urgent, comprehensive action at EU and national levels. But the original text says \"the majority of speakers, including Bushill-Matthews, supported urgent, comprehensive action...\" so it's not clear if he specifically proposed it or just supported it. The user's instruction says to include only what's attributed to the speaker. Since the summary says he emphasized the need for action, maybe the propSum is supporting comprehensive action. But the example in the user's message had specific proposals. Hmm.\n\nIn the given debate summary, the only direct quote from Bushill-Matthews is the one about the problems affecting society as a whole. There's no specific proposal mentioned from him. So propSum might be empty. But the user's example includes propSum even if it's a general call. Let me check the user's example again. The example response for propSum was \"He advocates for strict limitations on government demands for private data\". So even if it's a general call, if the summary says he supported something, then it's included. In this case, the summary says \"the majority of speakers, including Bushill-Matthews, supported urgent, comprehensive action...\" So the propSum would be \"supporting urgent, comprehensive action at both EU and national levels\". But the user's example had a specific proposal. However, the user's instructions say to include any proposals or policy actions mentioned by the speaker. Since the summary says he supported such action, but doesn't mention a specific proposal, maybe propSum is empty. But the user's example includes a proposal even if it's part of the position. This is a bit ambiguous. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the propSum can be \"urging urgent, comprehensive action at EU and national levels\" based on the summary's mention. Since the user's example includes \"proposes\" even if it's part of the position, perhaps here we can include that. So, the JSON would have:\n\nissueSum: \"Demographic challenges and the need for intergenerational solidarity in Europe\"\npositionSum: \"Emphasized that demographic issues are not just problems for the young but challenges for society as a whole, governments, and businesses\"\nargSum: \"Argued that these challenges require collective action from all sectors of society\"\npropSum: \"Supported urgent, comprehensive action at both EU and national levels\"\n\nBut I need to make sure that these are directly attributed to him. The summary says he emphasized the societal impact, and the majority supported action, including him. So the propSum is part of the majority's position, but since he's part of that majority, it's acceptable. So the answer would include that.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"Demographic challenges and the need for intergenerational solidarity in Europe\",\n\"positionSum\": \"Emphasized that demographic issues are not just problems for the young but challenges for society as a whole, governments, and businesses\",\n\"argSum\": \"Argued that these challenges require collective action from all sectors of society\",\n\"propSum\": \"Supported urgent, comprehensive action at both EU and national levels\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Vladim\u00edr \u0160pidla,", "english": "Vladim\u00edr \u0160pidla, Member of the Commission . (CS) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Bushill-Matthews, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Women\u2019s Rights and Gender Equality for their report, which is truly inspiring. I am delighted at the support that Parliament has expressed for our Green Paper. Parliament\u2019s report has come at the right time to provide a boost to the work of the Commission in respect of the new communication on demographics, since we will be finalising this communication over the next few weeks, and the timing therefore allows us to make use of your report in a very practical way. The report includes a number of highly important points that merit a place in the new communication, which draws conclusions from the responses we received to our Green Paper and from impact studies financed through the pilot action which the European Parliament organised. It sets out the possibilities for continuing cooperation at a European level over demographic issues.\nLadies and gentlemen, in recent times Europe has achieved some extraordinary successes. I would like to state this unequivocally, so that we may bear it in mind. The demographic ageing of our society is an outcome of this success in respect of two of the corners of the population pyramid and two locations on the pyramid. Average life expectancy has increased through the enormous advances in medicine, which have, for example, largely overcome cardiovascular diseases, thereby making a significant contribution to average life expectancy for middle-aged persons. Thanks to major medical advances in the area of child care and peri-natal care, the figures for child and infant mortality have fallen to levels never before seen in history and probably unexpected up to even a few decades ago. This is an unquestionable success. In a manner of speaking, we now enjoy twice as much life as our forbears. And I was delighted to discover, during the course of discussions with the insurance companies, that they are now working from mortality tables that go up not to 80, but to 120 years.\nThis success has its consequences, of course, since demographic ageing alters our entire society across all areas. It is important to realise that a holistic response is required, an integrated and all-inclusive response. Demographic ageing goes beyond the issues of pension systems, health, education, urban planning and so on. In fact, I doubt whether we could find any area of human activity that is not affected by demographic ageing, including the armed forces. We must therefore strive to ensure that active ageing becomes a reality. We must develop our care services for children and the elderly. We must develop new products and services in order to respond better to the needs of ageing individuals, and of course the needs of a society that will be ageing overall, as its age profile alters. We must finally invest more in developing and retaining our human capital in such a way that we achieve high levels of employment and enable the elderly to remain active in the workforce for longer. In the responses to the Green Paper consultations, especially in the responses of the Member States, great emphasis was placed on the need for better harmonisation of our private, family and professional lives.\nIt is already the case that migrants are reversing patterns of demographic decline in some Member States. In order to have a truly beneficial effect, migration must go hand in hand with greater efforts at integration and overcoming differences. Despite all of this, ladies and gentlemen, it remains clear that the migrants on whom we are counting as a permanent feature of our societies in the future do not represent the answer to the problems of demographic ageing. They are one of the components, but they should never be regarded as the solution.\nI would like to mention some of the issues that should be included in our programme of work over the coming years. We would like to renew our focus on harmonising family and professional life, as it is clear that European citizens want to have more children than they currently have. And in order for their natural longings and wishes to be fulfilled, we must in my view take a profound look at our society as a whole, our habits, our ways of doing things and the practices we employ. We would like to set up a European forum on population and demographics, enabling us to understand better the various aspects involved in incorporating a demographic dimension into individual policies, and supported by recognised experts in the field as well as voluntary organisations. In 2007 the Commission will be presenting a report on the measures taken by Member States to incorporate into their national legislation the provisions of Directive 2007/78/EC relating to age discrimination. Every two years, coinciding with the plenary sittings of the forum, the Commission will publish a report on population and demographics in Europe, which will describe demographic trends in Europe in the context of developments worldwide.\nLadies and gentlemen, the added value of Europe consists largely in organising the exchange of information, comparing proven approaches and presenting and disseminating the resulting data. We are already doing this in many areas, especially those areas relating to the Lisbon Strategy. Ladies and gentlemen, demographic developments are changing our society. They have changed it throughout history and will continue to do so in the future. Our society is becoming technically older in demographic terms, but we can also say with certainty that it is becoming wiser, as wisdom is related to experience and is in all societies a characteristic of those who have enjoyed good fortune, living long enough to have the opportunity to draw on their experiences. In our debates I feel that we shall find ways to respond to the challenges arising from the enormous success of our society in prolonging life and raising the quality of life, and we shall do it in such a way that future generations will follow the course that we plot, a course that will involve a more profound sense of the quality of life, the human dimension and the social values that we all cherish.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Vladim\u00edr \u0160pidla, Member of the Commission .

Looking at the sections, there's a part under \"Key Policy Proposals\" where he's mentioned. The summary says: \"Commissioner Vladim\u00edr \u0160pidla highlighted caregiving imbalances, noting that 'in Spain men devote 52 million hours a year to taking care of dependent persons... Women devote 200 million hours a year to this type of care.'\"\n\nSo his main point here is about the imbalance in caregiving responsibilities between men and women. The issue he raises is the gender disparity in caregiving. His position is that there's a need to address this imbalance. The argument is based on the statistics he provided about the hours spent by men and women. However, the summary doesn't mention any specific proposals he made, only the argument about the imbalance.\n\nWait, the user's example response includes \"propSum\" even if there's no proposal.

In the given debate summary, \u0160pidla's contribution is only about highlighting the caregiving imbalance. There's no mention of proposals from him. So the propSum would be an empty string.

I need to reach 116 to break even on my pension scheme.\nI am surprised that the Green Paper on demographic change does not take greater account of health aspects. The problems of an ageing society are not limited to economic aspects. New syndromes are coming to the fore, as can already be seen: dementia \u2013 be it Alzheimer\u2019s disease or subcortical dementia \u2013 vascular disease, from coronary heart disease to renal insufficiency, metabolic diseases \u2013 diabetes, first and foremost \u2013 arthritis of the spine and the large joints, and osteoporosis, to name but a few. This makes it all the more a question of prevention, of ensuring good living conditions for all before treatment and, if treatment should be necessary, of ensuring that this is as good as possible for all Europeans. It is a case of maintaining both quality of life and mobility.\nWe need social reorientation in order to meet these challenges. Retirement now comprises one third of the human lifespan. We need meaningful employment, social tasks, fulfilling tasks for older people, barrier-free living, new forms of housing, and, if necessary, excellent nursing care and medical care.\nHowever, I would take issue with the implicit and unreflective assumption in the Green Paper that a decline in population would have exclusively negative consequences for the established social system. I should therefore like to see the following issues addressed: the extent to which the negative consequences of a population decline may be addressed by innovation, higher rates of employment and modernisation of social protection; whether there may also be positive aspects to the decline in population, for example on issues relating to the environment, traffic congestion and land development; and whether a \u2018Pareto optimum\u2019 for Europe\u2019s population size may ultimately be established.", "lang": "DE", "original": "Thomas Ulmer (PPE-DE), Verfasser der Stellungnahme des mitberatenden Ausschusses f\u00fcr Umweltfragen, Volksgesundheit und Lebensmittelsicherheit . \u2013 Frau Pr\u00e4sidentin, Herr Kommissar, meine sehr verehrten Damen und Herren!

The user provided a debate summary and wants the main points from Thomas Ulmer's speech. First, I need to find where Thomas Ulmer is mentioned in the summary.\n\nLooking at the Executive Summary section, under \"Positions and Arguments,\" there's a part about Thomas Ulmer. He advocated for a health-centered approach, mentioning that retirement now makes up a third of lifespan and that older people need meaningful employment and social tasks. He also questioned assumptions about population decline, suggesting possible environmental benefits.\n\nThe user's instructions say to only include points attributed to the speaker. So I need to extract those specific points. The issue here is the demographic crisis, but Ulmer's focus is on aging populations and redefining retirement. His position is a health-centered approach, arguing against negative views of aging. The arguments include the idea that retirement is a significant part of life and that older people can contribute through meaningful roles. He also brings up environmental benefits as a counterpoint to population decline concerns.\n\nThe proposals part isn't directly mentioned, but he suggests rethinking retirement policies. However, the example response includes \"propSum\" even if not explicitly stated. Wait, the user says if there are no points, return an empty string.

Wait, the example given by the user has \"propSum\" as a summary of proposals. In the case of Thomas Ulmer, the summary mentions he advocated for a health-centered approach, which is part of his position, but does he propose specific policies?

So propSum might be empty. But the user's example includes propSum even if there's no info. Wait, the user says \"if there may be no points... respond with an empty string.\" So I need to check if the debate summary mentions any proposals from Ulmer.

Between 2005 and 2030 it is forecast that some 20 million people will be lost. By 2025, the population of the EU is expected to grow slightly, due to immigration, but then to fall again. Immigration is only a partial solution. Europeans do not have the number of children they want. Studies show that they would like to have 2.3 children on average, but they only have 1.5. This figure is too low for the population to be reinstated.\nAmong the reasons for the low birth rate are: belated or unstable access to employment; difficulty of access to housing; the late age at which parents are having their first child; a lack of tax incentives and family benefits; inadequate parental leave; lack of day-care facilities for children and other dependent persons; the salary gap between men and women; and the difficulty of reconciling family and working life.\nAccording to demographics expert Phillip Longman, in Europe it is conservative Christians and Muslims who are having more children, and this will lead to changes in the make-up of society. What can be done to redress the situation? Phillip Longman makes some suggestions: Sweden has succeeded in increasing its birth rates by raising social benefits and by building day-care centres and cr\u00e8ches. In Italy, it would be helpful if securing a loan to buy one\u2019s own house were made easier, as it is currently very difficult to do so.

The rest of the summary talks about other speakers and their contributions. So, the key point here is that Edite Estrela highlighted the gap between desired and actual birth rates. The issue she raised is the demographic crisis due to low birth rates. Her position is about the discrepancy between desired and actual fertility rates. The argument is based on the study she cited, and there's no specific proposal mentioned, just the issue and the data.\n\nNow, structuring this into the required JSON format. The \"issueSum\" would be about the demographic crisis and the birth rate gap. \"positionSum\" would state her point about the discrepancy. \"argSum\" would reference the study she mentioned. \"propSum\" is empty because there's no proposal listed for her. \n\nI need to make sure not to include any other speakers' points.

The user mentioned that other speakers' contributions shouldn't be included, only those attributed to the specified speaker. So I need to check if there's any mention of Mr. Saryusz-Wolski in the provided text.\n\nLooking at the debate summary sections: the Executive Summary has core issues, positions, arguments, key proposals, economic arguments, and conclusions. The speaker list includes 24 participants, but the user is asking about Mr. Saryusz-Wolski. However, scanning through the provided summary, I don't see any mention of Mr. Saryusz-Wolski. The names listed in the positions and arguments include people like Edite Estrela, Philip Bushill-Matthews, Thomas Ulmer, Nils Lundgren, Ilda Figueiredo, Gabriele Zimmer, Roselyne Bachelot-Narquin, Joel Hasse Ferreira, Struan Stevenson, Vladim\u00edr \u0160pidla, Marian Harkin, Kathy Sinnott, Marianne Mikko, Amalia Sartori, Karin J\u00f6ns, etc. But not Mr. Saryusz-Wolski.\n\nThe user's example response includes a scenario where the speaker is \"IN THE CHAIR: MR SARYUSZ-WOLSKI\", but in the actual debate summary provided, there's no information about this person's contributions. Therefore, according to the instructions, if there are no points attributed to the speaker, I should return an empty string.\n\nBut wait, the user might have a typo or mistake. Let me double-check. The debate summary's \"Speaker Name\" section says \"IN THE CHAIR: MR SARYUSZ-WOLSKI\", but in the actual content, there's no mention of him. Maybe he's the chair of the debate, but the summary doesn't include his speech. The user's instruction says to outline the main points or arguments made by that speaker, but if there's no information, then the response should be empty.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to return an empty JSON object as there's no data on Mr. Saryusz-Wolski's contributions in the provided debate summary.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"\",\n\"positionSum\": \"\",\n\"argSum\": \"\",\n\"propSum\": \"\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Struan Stevenson,", "english": "Struan Stevenson, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . \u2013 Mr President, in the words of Commissioner \u0160pidla, demographic change is not only a topical issue, but also one of the biggest challenges facing Europe today.

A large proportion of Europe is getting older. With rare exceptions, birth rates are low. Various social protection, solidarity and social security mechanisms have seen their sustainability come under threat. Immigration from countries outside Europe has apparently made it possible to balance activity rates in some Member States, but there are social consequences in terms of social integration and family support that must be taken into account.\nThe debate on demographic challenges has gained fresh urgency, with the advent of the recent Scandinavian implementation of the European Social model. It is very important to combine increased productivity and competitiveness benefits with strong female participation in the labour market. At the same time, birth rates have gone up and there is now more understanding when it comes to paternity leave and greater support for motherhood.\nAccordingly, from a European perspective, all efforts must be channelled into reconciling working life and family life in each Member State, by negotiating more flexible working hours, and by means of more appropriate and more widespread child support infrastructure. In addition, mutual knowledge of different social security systems must be increased and people must be given the opportunity to move freely from one national system to another, be it public, private or any other kind, for example, mutual benefit systems. This is very important for workers who pay social security in a particular Member State, whose lives will improve on their return to their country of origin and when they move to another Member State to work.\nThere also needs to be a drive to modernise social protection systems. Moreover, active ageing should be encouraged. This is all discussed in the reports by Mr\u00a0Bushill-Matthews, Mrs Estrela and all the members of committees working with such dedication in this area.

The user provided a detailed debate summary about demographic challenges and intergenerational solidarity in the European Parliament. The task is to extract the main points made by Ilda Figueiredo, but according to the instructions, I need to focus only on her contributions. \n\nFirst, I'll scan through the debate summary to find any mentions of Ilda Figueiredo. The summary mentions her in the \"Positions and Arguments\" section under the \"Social Justice Perspective.\" It states that speakers like Ilda Figueiredo and Gabriele Zimmer argued for fundamental economic system changes, with Zimmer emphasizing children as individuals rather than economic factors.\n\nWait, the user's example response includes issues, positions, arguments, and proposals. But in the provided debate summary, the only mention of Ilda Figueiredo is that she and Zimmer advocated for economic system changes, with Zimmer's point about children. However, the user's example includes a detailed breakdown, but in this case, the debate summary doesn't go into specifics about Ilda Figueiredo's arguments beyond that sentence. \n\nThe challenge here is that the debate summary doesn't provide more details about Ilda Figueiredo's specific points. The user's instructions say to include only the points attributed to the speaker. Since the summary only mentions her in the context of advocating for economic system changes and Zimmer's point about children, but there's no further information on Ilda's specific arguments or proposals. \n\nTherefore, the response should reflect that there's no specific information provided about Ilda Figueiredo's arguments beyond the general statement. However, the user's example includes even if there's no information, the response should be an empty string. Wait, the user's instruction says: \"There may be no points or arguments attributed to the speaker. If this is the case, respond with an empty string.\"\n\nBut in the debate summary, there is a mention of Ilda Figueiredo. The problem is whether that mention is sufficient to create the JSON fields. The user's example shows that if there's no info, return empty. But here, there is a mention, albeit brief. However, the user's example response includes \"issueSum\", \"positionSum\", etc., even if the info is minimal. \n\nBut the user's instruction says: \"You will outline the main points or arguments made by that speaker. Your job is not to summarise the debate. Contributions or arguments from other speakers should not be included in your response. You will only include the points that are attributed to the speaker you are asked about.\"\n\nIn the debate summary, the only info about Ilda Figueiredo is that she and Zimmer argued for fundamental economic system changes. However, the user's example response includes details like \"He supports the Data Act's objectives...\" but in this case, the debate summary doesn't provide specifics. So, perhaps the answer is that there are no specific points attributed to her, hence an empty string. But the user's example shows that even if there's a mention, you have to structure the JSON. \n\nWait, the user's example response includes a scenario where the speaker's points are present. But in this case, the debate summary only mentions Ilda Figueiredo in a general sense. The problem is whether that's enough to fill the JSON fields. However, the user's instruction says to only include points attributed to the speaker. If the debate summary doesn't provide specific arguments, then the answer should be empty. \n\nBut the user's example response includes a case where the speaker's arguments are mentioned. However, in this case, the debate summary doesn't elaborate further. Therefore, the correct answer would be an empty JSON object. But the user's instruction says to respond with an empty string if there are no points. Wait, the user's instruction says: \"If this is the case, respond with an empty string.\" But the user's example shows a JSON structure. However, the user's instruction says to respond in JSON format, but if there are no points, return an empty string. But JSON can't have an empty string as a valid structure. Wait, the user's example shows that the response is a JSON object. However, if there are no points, the user says to respond with an empty string. But that's conflicting. \n\nWait, the user's exact instruction: \"If this is the case, respond with an empty string.\" But the user also says to structure the response as JSON. So perhaps the correct approach is to return an empty JSON object, but the user's example shows that when there are points, it's a JSON with the fields. However, the user's instruction says to return an empty string if there are no points. But JSON can't have an empty string as a valid response. So maybe the user expects that when there are no points, the JSON is empty. But the user's example shows that even when there are points, the JSON is filled. \n\nIn this case, since the debate summary only mentions Ilda Figueiredo in a general way, but doesn't provide specific arguments or positions, the correct response would be an empty JSON. However, the user's instruction says to return an empty string. But the user's example shows a JSON. This is confusing. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's instruction is that if there are no points, return an empty string, but the JSON structure is required. However, the user's example shows that the response is a JSON. So perhaps the correct approach is to return an empty JSON object when there are no points. However, the user's instruction says \"respond with an empty string.\" \n\nThis is conflicting. But given the user's example, they expect a JSON object. So perhaps even if there are no points, the JSON is empty. But the user's instruction says to respond with an empty string. \n\nThis is a bit of a dilemma. However, given the user's instruction says: \"If this is the case, respond with an empty string.\" So perhaps the correct answer is an empty string. But the user's example shows a JSON. However, the user's instruction says to respond in JSON format. So maybe the correct approach is to return an empty JSON object. \n\nBut the user's example shows that when there are points, the JSON is filled. So in this case, since the debate summary doesn't have specific points about Ilda Figueiredo, the answer is an empty JSON. However, the user's instruction says to return an empty string. \n\nBut the user's instruction says: \"You must respond in json format. Outputs must be parseable by json.loads().\"\n\nSo, an empty string is not a valid JSON. Therefore, the correct approach is to return an empty JSON object. But the user's instruction says to return an empty string if there are no points. \n\nThis is conflicting. However, given the user's example, perhaps the correct answer is an empty JSON object. But the user's instruction says to return an empty string. \n\nIn this case, I'll proceed under the assumption that if there are no points, the JSON should be empty. However, the user's example shows that when there are points, the JSON is filled. Therefore, in this case, since the debate summary only mentions Ilda Figueiredo in a general way without specific arguments, the answer is an empty JSON.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"\",\n\"positionSum\": \"\",\n\"argSum\": \"\",\n\"propSum\": \"\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Kathy Sinnott,", "english": "Kathy Sinnott, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . \u2013 Mr President, in 1981 in Ireland I heard a lecture by Dr\u00a0Herbert Ratner, a professor of public health and medical ethics.

We want the right balance to be restored in our continent between the expectations of women and those of our countries.\nIn order to tackle the first challenge, two policies need to be followed. The first is to do away with any disincentive to extend a person\u2019s working life, and therefore to endorse all policies designed to enable elderly people to remain directly involved in the job market for as long as possible. The second policy is to give the elderly the opportunity to remain within their communities for as long as possible. All social policies should be geared towards this objective: to remain in the family environment and in the surroundings of one\u2019s own home, with residential care used only as a last resort.\nAs regards birth-rate policy, I believe that, as always in life, it helps to have concrete evidence. It must be pointed out that, over the last few years, it was those very countries that took an intelligent approach to drafting new tax policies that went on to obtain good results; one interesting example is France.

It is evident that neither the Millennium Development Goals nor the fight against world poverty feature even remotely in our debate on demographic change. After all, the main problem is not that the European population is declining, but that, firstly, this is disproportional from region to region; secondly, coexistence in society is at risk; and, thirdly, we are not relating demographic change in Europe to the exploding world population.\nWe are looking at the ageing of European society almost exclusively from the point of view of the dwindling workforce and, in the process, completely disregarding the development of productivity. At the same time, we are exploiting productivity as a means to cut social, sickness, health and pension benefits and to consider prolonging working life greatly. I am referring here only to the study prepared and published by the Commission, which envisages 71 years.\nI call for a change in priorities. We need a child-friendly society, which actually welcomes living with children. We need a different kind of debate, as we cannot just see children as an investment to safeguard labour and pension provision. Furthermore, we cannot continue simply seeking a better reconciliation of working life and family life, of working time and leisure time. We need to concern ourselves with something more: with the children, for it is they who are important here. Children must really be central, and must be regarded as individuals.\nNaturally, society also needs to meet the challenges of ageing, for example by means of expanding social services or, of course, by means of urban development: for example, old people\u2019s housing, and transport designed with children and the elderly in mind.

So ist es doch augenscheinlich, dass in unserer Debatte um den demografischen Wandel sowohl die Millenniums-Entwicklungsziele als auch der Kampf gegen Armut in der Welt nicht die geringste Rolle spielen. Das Problem besteht doch nicht in erster Linie darin, dass die europ\u00e4ische Bev\u00f6lkerung sinkt, sondern darin, dass dies erstens disproportional in den Regionen vor sich geht, zweitens das Zusammenleben in der Gesellschaft gef\u00e4hrdet wird, und wir drittens diesen demografischen Wandel innerhalb Europas nicht in einen Zusammenhang mit der explodierenden Weltbev\u00f6lkerung bringen.\nDie Alterungsprozesse der Gesellschaft in Europa betrachten wir fast ausschlie\u00dflich unter dem Aspekt des Arbeitskr\u00e4fteschwunds und lassen dabei v\u00f6llig au\u00dfer Acht, wie sich die Produktivit\u00e4t entwickelt.

The user provided a parliamentary debate summary and wants the main points from Marianne Mikko's speech. First, I need to locate her contributions in the debate summary.\n\nLooking through the sections, under \"Economic and Social Arguments,\" there's a mention of Marianne Mikko. The key quote is her warning about Europe facing a demographic and social catastrophe similar to the Asian tsunami if immediate action isn't taken. \n\nThe user's instructions say to only include points attributed to the specified speaker. So I need to make sure I don't include other speakers' arguments. The summary mentions she delivered a \"dramatic warning,\" emphasizing the urgency. \n\nNow, structuring the JSON response. The issueSum should reflect the demographic crisis and the urgency. PositionSum would be her stance on the need for immediate action. The argument is based on the potential catastrophe. Proposals might not be explicitly mentioned, but her emphasis on urgency could be seen as a call for action. However, the example response includes propSum even if it's a call to action. But in the debate summary, she didn't propose specific policies, just highlighted the urgency. So propSum might be empty. Wait, the example had \"He advocates for strict limitations...\" but in this case, maybe there's no specific proposal. Let me check again. The summary says she warned about the catastrophe, but no specific proposals. So propSum would be an empty string. \n\nSo the JSON would have issueSum about the demographic and social catastrophe, positionSum about the urgency, argSum about the tsunami analogy, and propSum as empty. Need to make sure all points are solely from Mikko. No other speakers' points. Alright, that should cover it.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"Marianne Mikko highlighted the urgent demographic and social crisis facing Europe, emphasizing the need for immediate action to prevent a catastrophic outcome.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"She stressed the critical importance of addressing demographic challenges without delay, positioning them as a pressing societal and political priority.\",\n\"argSum\": \"Mikko argued that failing to act would lead to a 'demographic and social catastrophe on the scale of the Asian tsunami,' using a dramatic analogy to underscore the severity and urgency of the crisis.\",\n\"propSum\": \"\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Marie Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou (PPE-DE).", "english": "Marie Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou (PPE-DE). \u2013 (EL) Mr President, the rapporteur, Mr Bushill-Matthews, who is known for his attention to detail and heightened sensitivity and who has patiently prepared this report, has quite rightly highlighted possible solutions to the demographic problem, starting with the means of decisively addressing low economic growth and high rates of unemployment.\nA varied approach is advocated, depending on the circumstances, which \u2013 as is rightly emphasised \u2013 must respect freedom of choice and facilitate the exercise of the fundamental human right of European families to have as many children as they wish, without the obstacles raised by the difficulty of combining a professional and family life. Identifying these obstacles and those which exist both inside and outside the workplace (such as taxation, housing and the cost of education, health and insurance) is the responsibility of the Member States, given that the Member States alone shape both development and family policy.\nHistorically, of course, immigration has often resolved the problem of renewing the population and today it fills the gap created by our choice to have no children or just one child at an advanced age. What has brought us to these life choices in times of peace and opulence? Seeking the causes of demographic change is not the concern either of the European Commission or of the governments. It does not fall within the competences of the European Union; it falls within the competence of each European citizen who wants to go beyond his human capabilities, both in planning the beginning of life and in imposing its end.\nCertainly education, training and finding work in an environment of sustainable development are necessary preconditions to a high standard of living. However, if there is to be no demographic problem, if new Europeans are to be born and grow old under dignified conditions, future parents need of their own accord to have a demand for reliability in their personal relations and, in general, a vision of life for the present and the future.", "lang": "EL", "original": "\u039c\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03b1

The steps taken by the Lithuanian Government to solve this problem are clearly insufficient and so the appearance of documents at European level is welcomed.

I feel that we have had clear confirmation of the basic view that this is a matter of fundamental change, requiring a holistic or mainstream approach, as has been stated. At the same time, consideration has been given to various aspects of the wider problem. For example, it was stated that the Green Paper does not pay equal attention to two sets of problems, which is to say the problems in respect of the health sector and the problems in an international context. You may have noted from my report that the international context is to be covered in the regular reports, since from this standpoint a specific preliminary response already exists. The question of health is one of the most fundamental of all and I feel that the debate has inspired us to develop our thinking in this area further in the future.\nThis problem raises not only technical and organisational issues, but also a whole raft of ethical issues, since an ageing population will increasingly create situations where people are living in extreme circumstances through a combination of fate and their personal state of health. This means that an appropriate ethical response will be very difficult to find, requiring a great deal of profound reflection.\nI think it was also clear that one issue on which attention was focused, in my view justifiably, was the question of children and the very low birth rate and how we might change or at least influence this. It also emerged clearly from the debate that that this was a general European question, since despite the fact that Ireland, for example, has at present the highest number of live childbirths per woman of childbearing age, it has also recorded a decline over the past 20 years sharper than just about any other country, and the current level is not sufficient to maintain demographic stability. There are, of course, other states which are in a far worse position and where the situation might become extremely difficult within a few generations.\nIt is also clear that we must give very serious consideration to the fact that not every society is people friendly. There is an old Roman saying \u2018Inter arma silent Musae\u2019, in other words when society is under any kind of stress or in an extreme situation, creativity suffers. In my view, having children is a matter of profound need and profound desire. Educating children and caring for them is also, in its way, an activity that requires very high levels of creativity, and it is clear that European citizens, if they are to decide in favour of having children, need greater security in a world that is undergoing enormous change.\nThe debate also touched on questions of gender balance, in my view justifiably.

Let me read through the debate summary again to make sure I don't miss anything.\n\nThe user mentioned that the debate was about demographic challenges and solidarity between generations. The speaker in question is Vladim\u00edr \u0160pidla. Looking at the sections provided, there's a part under \"Key Policy Proposals\" and \"Economic and Social Arguments\" where he's mentioned.\n\nIn the \"Key Policy Proposals\" section, it says: \"Commissioner Vladim\u00edr \u0160pidla highlighted caregiving imbalances, noting that 'in Spain men devote 52 million hours a year to taking care of dependent persons... Women devote 200 million hours a year to this type of care.'\" So his main point here is about the unequal distribution of caregiving responsibilities between men and women. He's pointing out that women spend significantly more time on caregiving, which is a gender equality issue.\n\nThen, under \"Economic and Social Arguments,\" there's a mention of him: \"Commissioner Vladim\u00edr \u0160pidla emphasized the need for 'holistic or mainstream approach to addressing demographic challenges' and creating 'more people-friendly societies that provide greater security for citizens deciding to have children.'\" So his position is advocating for a holistic approach to demographic issues, which includes making societies more supportive for people considering having children.\n\nSo, putting this together, the issue he raised is the gender imbalance in caregiving. His position is about a holistic approach to demographic challenges. The argument is that addressing caregiving imbalances is part of creating a more supportive society. However, the summary doesn't mention any specific proposals from him beyond the holistic approach. The propSum would be his call for a holistic approach, but I need to check if that's considered a proposal. The example given in the user's instruction includes \"propSum\" as specific policy actions. In the debate summary, \u0160pidla's proposal is mentioned as \"mainstreaming demographic considerations across all policy areas,\" which is part of the conclusions. However, in the specific sections, under \"Key Policy Proposals,\" his contribution is the caregiving data, and under \"Economic and Social Arguments,\" his position is the holistic approach. \n\nWait, the user's instruction says to only include points attributed to the speaker. The summary says \"The Commission's Vladim\u00edr \u0160pidla emphasized the need for 'holistic or mainstream approach...'\". So that's his position. The argument would be that he's advocating for this approach to address demographic challenges. The propSum would be the holistic approach. But the example given in the user's instruction has \"propSum\" as a specific policy action. However, in the debate summary, the \"holistic approach\" is a position rather than a specific proposal. The actual proposals mentioned are things like family support measures, work-life balance solutions, etc. But for \u0160pidla, the summary mentions his emphasis on the holistic approach and the caregiving imbalance. \n\nSo, the issueSum would be the gender imbalance in caregiving. The positionSum is advocating for a holistic approach. The argSum would be that this approach is needed to address demographic challenges. The propSum would be the holistic approach. But I need to check if the summary mentions any specific proposals from him. The conclusion section says \"the Commission's Vladim\u00edr \u0160pidla emphasized the need for 'holistic or mainstream approach...'\". So the propSum would be \"advocates for a holistic or mainstream approach to addressing demographic challenges\". \n\nSo structuring the JSON accordingly. The user's example has \"propSum\" as a summary of proposals. So I need to make sure that's captured.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The speaker highlighted the significant gender imbalance in caregiving responsibilities, noting that women in Spain dedicate substantially more hours to caregiving compared to men.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"He emphasized the need for a holistic or mainstream approach to addressing demographic challenges and creating more people-friendly societies that support citizens in deciding to have children.\",\n\"argSum\": \"His advocacy for a holistic approach is based on the necessity of integrating demographic considerations across all policy areas to create supportive environments for families and address caregiving disparities.\",\n\"propSum\": \"Advocates for a holistic or mainstream approach to demographic challenges, including mainstreaming demographic change impact assessments across all policy fields.\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "President.", "english": "President.

The user provided a debate summary about demographic challenges and intergenerational solidarity in the European Parliament.

The user mentioned that I should only include points attributed to David Martin. Let me scan through the sections to find any mentions of him.\n\nLooking at the \"Executive Summary\" sections, under \"Key Policy Proposals\" and \"Economic and Social Arguments,\" there's a mention of David Martin. Wait, in the provided debate summary, under the \"Executive Summary\" there's a section titled \"Key Policy Proposals\" and then \"Economic and Social Arguments.\" Let me check each part.\n\nWait, the user's example response includes a speaker named David Martin, but in the provided debate summary, I need to check if David Martin is mentioned. Let me search through the text.\n\nLooking through the \"Executive Summary\" sections:\n\nUnder \"Key Policy Proposals,\" there's a mention of \"Roselyne Bachelot-Narquin\" and \"Joel Hasse Ferreira,\" but not David Martin. Then under \"Economic and Social Arguments,\" there's a mention of \"Kathy Sinnott\" and \"Marianne Mikko,\" but not David Martin. Wait, the user's example response is about David Martin, but in the actual debate summary provided, is there any mention of David Martin?\n\nWait, the user's instruction says that the speaker name is David Martin (PSE).

The user might have made a mistake, or perhaps in the actual data, David Martin is mentioned elsewhere. But according to the provided text, there's no mention of David Martin. Therefore, the answer should be an empty JSON.\n\nBut the user's example response includes a speaker named David Martin. Maybe in the actual debate summary provided by the user, there is a mention. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the user's input says: \"Speaker Name: David Martin (PSE). \u2013\" So the user is asking about David Martin, but in the debate summary provided, there's no mention of him.
