The human rights and democracy clause in EU agreements constitutes one of the instruments of this policy. The clause, as has already been stated, has so far been incorporated into more than 50 agreements and applies to more than 120 countries. Despite the frequent positive experiences, however, I feel it is necessary to consider how we might improve or perfect the clause.\nIn this context, the Agnoletto report provides many important and interesting suggestions. It points out, for example, that the concept of human and civil rights and freedoms also includes economic, social and cultural rights. It also emphasises that the EU, in its support for human rights, should focus on implementing policies in the area of gender equality and women\u2019s rights and should oppose any form of discrimination on the grounds, for example, of sexual orientation, or of the rights of disabled people. I should like to lend my support to the idea that the European Parliament should play a greater role in the preparation process for implementing and assessing the democracy clause, and I should like to add that both civil society and the international network of non-governmental organisations involved in human rights should play a much greater role in this process.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Libor Rou\u010dek (PSE). \u2013 ( CS ) Ladies and gentlemen, the development and strengthening of democracy and the rule of law, along with the upholding of human rights and freedoms, has become an integral part of the running of the European Union and of foreign policy.
