In my view it is well-balanced and objective, and above all it gives us an excellent summary not only of what has been achieved in the area of human rights, but also of the important aspects that we must focus on in the future. I should like to mention the following key areas.\nFirstly, I endorse the view that human rights should not be understood only as civil and political rights, but that it is absolutely necessary to focus on economic, social and cultural rights as well, and not only within the context of achieving the UN Millennium Development Goals. Secondly, we should draw on the positive experiences that have emerged so far from the Cotonou Agreement, and ensure that clauses on upholding human rights and democratic principles are included in all sectoral agreements or all agreements with developed states, in order to achieve a level playing field for all parties to the Agreement. Thirdly, it is necessary to place greater emphasis on implementing so-called positive measures to motivate states, and to use negative measures only where absolutely necessary, where other options have been exhausted. When weighing up such options it is clearly necessary to consider the impact of the measures on ordinary citizens.\nIn my view, one of the key factors from the standpoint of ensuring transparency is for the European Parliament and civil society to play a greater role in the implementation of clauses relating to human rights and democratic principles. The work of the Commission and Council has so far had little transparency, and has often been misleading, giving rise to concerns that political, strategic and commercial interests are over-ruling the consistent implementation of clearly defined standards. It is absolutely necessary, if we are to increase transparency and democratisation in decision-making processes, for the European Commission to inform Parliament and interested parties in the public sphere regularly, ideally on an annual basis, about the implementation of clauses dealing with the upholding of human rights and democratic principles, including studies of individual cases and of the approach taken by the Council over a given period, the success of given measures and suggested approaches for the future, in case a situation does not improve. An objective methodology and a clear procedure for implementing the aforementioned clause will of course be essential.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Ji\u0159\u00ed Ma\u0161t\u00e1lka, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group . \u2013 ( CS ) Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on an outstanding piece of work.
