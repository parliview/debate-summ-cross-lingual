The protection of democracy, human rights and the rule of law and good governance are fundamental elements of the European Union; they must also be an integral part of the EU\u2019s external policy.\nI would like to lay special emphasis on the promotion of equal opportunities and on the fight against discrimination based on sexual orientation. These questions are still serious problems in every country today. Women\u2019s and children\u2019s rights, and the rights of those with different sexual orientations, are being violated every day.\nIn order to improve implementation of these aims, the European Union must prepare new procedures and new criteria for applying human rights and democracy clauses. I agree that, in order to ensure a more coherent, effective and transparent approach to European human rights policy, a revision of the current text is indispensable.\nI support the establishment of human rights subcommittees under EU third country agreements, to be responsible for reviewing compliance with the clause, monitoring its application and implementation, and proposing actions to address democracy and human rights problems.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Katalin L\u00e9vai (PSE). \u2013 Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this ambitious work, and I thank him for it.
