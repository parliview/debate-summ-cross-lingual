The human rights policy of the European Community and indeed of the wider international community played an important part in the fall of the undemocratic regimes in Southern Europe in the 1970s and in Central and Eastern Europe after 1989. At present, human rights and democracy form the axis around which the European Union\u2019s external and security policy is being constructed. The Union\u2019s foreign policy is aimed at creating a global world order based on peace, democracy, human rights, the rule of law, sustainable development and stable growth.\nThe human rights and democracy clause should now be applied more widely and included in all agreements entered into by the European Union with third countries, regardless of whether they are industrialised or developing countries. The aforementioned clause should also feature in sectoral agreements, trade exchanges, and technical and financial aid. Pursuant to this clause, the relevant European Union institutions, including the European Parliament, should have the authority to effectively monitor respect for human rights and democratic principles by parties to agreements with the European Union. In this respect, it is important to bear in mind the relationship between respect for human rights, democracy and development. General principles encompassing the protection of human rights, the rule of law and respect for democratic values are a sine qua non for the eradication of poverty.\nA good way of dealing with this issue would be to include in such agreements a recommendation that the EU and the country party to the agreement should exchange reports on human rights on an annual basis. It would also be desirable to set up a mechanism for consultation with non-governmental organisations. Election monitoring missions play a vital part in protecting and supporting human rights and democracy beyond the Union\u2019s borders, as does the aid the Union should provide to civil society in third countries.", "lang": "PL", "original": "J\u00f3zef Pinior (PSE). \u2013 Panie Przewodnicz\u0105cy!
