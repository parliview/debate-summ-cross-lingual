{"speaker": "John Attard-Montalto (PSE).", "english": "John Attard-Montalto (PSE). \u2013 (MT) I am amazed at how, in this Parliament, we often detect small shortcomings in Europe, when everybody knows that this continent is actually a standard-bearer trying to export these fundamental and noble rights to other parts of the world. It should be pointed out that there has always been a discussion as to whether human rights can be administered internally by the State or government or whether they are universal. It is clear beyond doubt that human rights are universal rights and that no dictator or State is entitled to deny human beings the smallest aspect of their fundamental rights. The problem is that of how Europe is to make use of its resources to try to export these noble aims. In this area, we sometimes criticise Europe for not employing its rights and its power, including economic power, and, at the same time, we criticise the administration or the institutions for closing their eyes to certain shortcomings. There is a decision to be made. We have to decide whether it is by using persuasion or economic power that Europe can best export its aims. I would conclude by saying that we have to give our institutions all the resources to ensure that our values are made sufficiently coherent to be exported by the Community.
