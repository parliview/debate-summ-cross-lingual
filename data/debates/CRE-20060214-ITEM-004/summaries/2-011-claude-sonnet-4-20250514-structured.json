In fact, we adopted our opinion, which echoes what Mr Agnoletto was saying, by 20 votes to 1.\nAs the Commissioner said, 14 years on from the start of these human rights agreements being included, it is time for a fresh look. Since 1995 the human rights clause has been invoked on 12 occasions. We have invoked it against Niger, Guinea-Bissau, the Central African Republic, Togo, Haiti \u2013 from which I have just returned from an election-observation mission, Comoros, the Ivory Coast, Fiji, Liberia and Zimbabwe. The human rights clause has also prevented the conclusion of agreements with Australia and New Zealand and with Belarus, following the increasingly authoritarian rule of Mr Lukashenko.\nWe welcome the inclusion of the clause and would like it extended to sectoral trade agreements as well. We believe there should be specific benchmarks and possibly a more nuanced set of benchmarks for responding to human rights violations. We ask that the Commission establish a monitoring mechanism that links the implementation and temporary suspension of trade agreements and autonomous trade measures to beneficiary countries\u2019 compliance with basic democratic standards and respect for human and minority rights, as set out in the European Parliament\u2019s annual report on human rights in the world.\nI take the Commissioner\u2019s point that, if our involvement is included in terms of the adoption of the clause in trade and other agreements, it is not formally included in terms of the implementation of the clause. However, we ask the Commission, by its own initiative, to involve the European Parliament more systematically in the assessment of the implementation of the human rights clauses and similar requirements in the future.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Glyn Ford (PSE), draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on International Trade . \u2013 Mr President, my committee welcomes Mr Agnoletto\u2019s report which, with very few reservations, we fully support.
