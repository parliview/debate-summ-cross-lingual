{"speaker": "Ana Maria Gomes (PSE).", "english": "Ana Maria Gomes (PSE). \u2013 (PT) I support all of the recommendations made by Mr Agnoletto in this report. I especially welcome the inclusion of a reciprocity clause in all agreements with third countries. It is regrettable that the implementation of the human rights clause has until now been contingent on geo-political and geo-economic considerations which have nothing to do with the Union as a whole, but which often depend on the narrow strategies of some Member States and some Commission services.\nThe most glaring example of the lack of substantive implementation of this clause is Ethiopia, despite the fact that Parliament has repeatedly asked the Commission and the Council to open consultations, under the terms of Article 96, following the massacres and serious violations of human rights that took place in the wake of the elections.\nI am appalled by the Council\u2019s silence and inaction on this matter. Only the Commission and one Member State \u2013 the United Kingdom \u2013 have suspended direct aid to the budget of the Ethiopian Government, the minimum they could do in the circumstances. Given, however, that they did not clarify the terms and conditions, this had no impact whatsoever on the Ethiopian Government, and sent out a disastrous message not only to the Ethiopian people as a whole, but also to all Africans \u2013 the headquarters of the Organisation for African Unity is in the Ethiopian capital \u2013 as well as to the EU Member States and to all countries with which the EU maintains relations.", "lang": "PT", "original": "Ana Maria Gomes (PSE). \u2013 Apoio todas as recomenda\u00e7\u00f5es feitas pelo Deputado Agnoletto neste relat\u00f3rio e, designadamente, a inclus\u00e3o da cl\u00e1usula de reciprocidade em todos os acordos com pa\u00edses terceiros. \u00c9 lament\u00e1vel que a aplica\u00e7\u00e3o da cl\u00e1usula dos direitos humanos esteja dependente, at\u00e9 agora, de considera\u00e7\u00f5es geopol\u00edticas e geoecon\u00f3micas que nem sequer s\u00e3o da Uni\u00e3o no seu conjunto, mas que muitas vezes dependem das perspectivas estreitas de alguns Estados-Membros e de alguns servi\u00e7os da Comiss\u00e3o.\nO exemplo gritante da falta de consequ\u00eancia na aplica\u00e7\u00e3o desta cl\u00e1usula est\u00e1 na Eti\u00f3pia.
