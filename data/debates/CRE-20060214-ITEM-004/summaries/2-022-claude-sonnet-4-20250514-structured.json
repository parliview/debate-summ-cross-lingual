{"speaker": "Bruno Gollnisch (NI). \u2013", "english": "Bruno Gollnisch (NI). \u2013 (FR) Mr\u00a0President, we are discussing the clauses on respect for human rights that the EU imposes on the countries with which it deals. So be it, but before we go looking for the speck in our neighbour's eye, should we not remove the plank from our own?\nFor example, in my country, France, as in the rest of the EU, the tyranny of political correctness is becoming completely intolerable. In theory, you can say what you like about mass immigration, but if you oppose it, you are condemned for incitement to racial hatred. If, as happened recently, you mention the islamisation of Alsace, even as an elected representative, you become the target of disgraceful condemnations that only reflect badly on those who made them. In theory, you can say what you like about contemporary history, but, in practice, you can only do that provided you comply with a Communist-inspired law, otherwise you risk being imprisoned. For having contested this law during a political press conference, I myself have lost, at least temporarily, my post at the University of Lyon. If you say you prefer natural families to homosexual partnerships, you risk being condemned once again, as a member of the French parliament from the majority party found out recently. A mayor does not have the right to give a fellow countryman preference over a foreigner when allocating social housing, nor can an individual give this sort of preference in any field. I could give you more examples.\nEvery group, every lobby, every minority and every deviancy has developed its own methods of pressurising, intimidating and persecuting the majority, with the active or passive complicity of the authorities. In these circumstances, ladies and gentlemen, before we impose on our partners a clause that you seem to interpret completely unilaterally, we would do well to start by putting our own house in order.", "lang": "FR", "original": "Bruno Gollnisch (NI). - Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, nous parlons des clauses concernant le respect des droits de l\u2019homme que l\u2019Union impose aux pays avec lesquels elle traite, soit! Mais avant de chercher la paille qui est dans l\u2019\u0153il de nos voisins, ne devrions-nous pas \u00f4ter la poutre qui est dans le n\u00f4tre?\nAinsi, dans mon pays, en France, comme ailleurs dans l\u2019Union, la dictature du politiquement correct devient tout \u00e0 fait insupportable. On peut th\u00e9oriquement tout dire de l\u2019immigration massive, mais si on est contre, on est condamn\u00e9 pour incitation \u00e0 la haine raciale. Si l\u2019on \u00e9voque, comme r\u00e9cemment, l\u2019islamisation de l\u2019Alsace, m\u00eame en tant qu\u2019\u00e9lu, on fait l\u2019objet d\u2019indignes condamnations qui ne d\u00e9shonorent que ceux qui les ont prononc\u00e9es.

Si l\u2019on dit pr\u00e9f\u00e9rer la famille naturelle aux unions homosexuelles, on risque encore d\u2019\u00eatre condamn\u00e9, comme l\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 tout r\u00e9cemment un d\u00e9put\u00e9 fran\u00e7ais appartenant \u00e0 la majorit\u00e9 gouvernementale.

Je pourrais multiplier les exemples.\nChaque groupe, chaque lobby, chaque minorit\u00e9, chaque d\u00e9viance a d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 ses moyens de pression, d\u2019intimidation, de pers\u00e9cution de la majorit\u00e9 du peuple, avec la complicit\u00e9 active ou passive des autorit\u00e9s.
