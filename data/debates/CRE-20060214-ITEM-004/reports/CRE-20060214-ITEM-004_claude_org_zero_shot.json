The next item is the report by Mr Vittorio Agnoletto on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs on the human rights and democracy clause in European Union agreements ( 2005/2057(INI) ) ( A6-0004/2006 )."}, {"speaker": "Vittorio Agnoletto (GUE/NGL),", "english": "Vittorio Agnoletto (GUE/NGL), rapporteur. \u2013 (IT) Mr\u00a0President, ladies and gentlemen, the human rights and democracy clause has a long history within Parliament and is based on the assumption that civil and political rights and, in a broader sense, economic, social and cultural rights as well need to be at the heart of European Union policy.\nThe clause began in the early 1990s with the Lom\u00e9 Agreement and in 1990 itself was also applied to Argentina. Every year, in its annual report, the European Parliament calls for this clause to be given greater weight and urges the Council to grant Parliament a more important role in overseeing its implementation. Parliament\u2019s requests have so far not been met with a satisfactory response. The clause has now been included in over 50 agreements and applies to over 120 countries. In that respect, I must stress the importance of the Cotonou Agreement signed with the ACP countries in June 2000, which enhanced the role of this clause.\nThe first point that I should like to address concerns the European Parliament. It has to give its assent before an agreement comes into force, but it is not called upon to give its opinion on initiating consultation or partly suspending an agreement. That lessens its institutional and, more generally, its political role.\nThat is why I consider it important to emphasise that Parliament is no longer prepared to give its assent to new international agreements that do not contain a human rights and democracy clause. Parliament maintains that it has to play a part in defining the negotiating mandate for new agreements with third countries and, above all, in drafting their political and human rights objectives. In addition, Parliament asks to be involved in the decision-making process for initiating consultation or suspending an agreement, or indeed for suspending any appropriate negative measures that have already been imposed on a country. Lastly, Parliament asks to be associated with the Association Councils and their subcommittees on human rights and hopes that its interparliamentary delegations can play an enhanced role in that respect, by regularly including debates on the democracy clause on their meeting agendas.\nAnother point that I should like to address concerns the reciprocity between the European Union and third countries, which so far has not been fully exploited. I also believe that the clause should be applied in relation to the violation under discussion and not in relation to the country under discussion.\nIt is also necessary to extend the clause to all new agreements between the European Union and third countries, both industrialised and developing, including sectoral agreements and commercial, technical or financial aid, along the lines of what has been done for the ACP countries.\nHuman rights issues need to be systematically included on Association Council agendas. To that end, we consider that the heads of the Commission\u2019s external delegations in third countries must play an enhanced role and we call for country-by-country multiannual strategy documents to be drawn up and to be debated on a regular basis.\nA structured dialogue must be established between the Association Council and its subcommittee on human rights. We call for the general establishment of subcommittees on human rights, with a mandate to review compliance with and the application and implementation of the democracy clause, and to propose specific positive actions to improve democracy and human rights. It is important to underline that we call for these subcommittees to include and to consult representatives of parliaments and of organisations representing civil society.\nThen there is a further extremely important aspect. This resolution recognises that the need for unanimity within the Council in order to initiate a consultation procedure has made it more difficult to apply the clause. We therefore call for the abolition of this unanimity requirement and, in that respect, for the revision of Article 300(2) of the EC Treaty, which limits the role of the European Parliament in such cases.\nLastly, while we believe that the clause should be applied to all countries and all agreements, we also think that, in the case of countries covered by the new neighbourhood policy, one might consider signing agreements that go beyond the democracy clause, based on the sharing of common institutions for promoting democratic principles and human rights, on the example of the Council of Europe and regional agreements.", "lang": "IT", "original": "Vittorio Agnoletto (GUE/NGL), relatore . \u2013 Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, la clausola relativa ai diritti dell\u2019uomo e alla democrazia ha una lunga storia all\u2019interno del Parlamento e parte dal presupposto che i diritti civili e politici ma, intesi in senso lato, anche quelli economici, sociali e culturali, debbano essere al centro della politica dell\u2019Unione europea.\nLe clausola nasce nei primi anni \u201990 con l\u2019accordo di Lom\u00e9 e, proprio nel 1990, \u00e8 stata applicata anche all\u2019Argentina. Nella sua relazione annuale, il Parlamento europeo chiede ogni anno che questa clausola assuma un maggiore significato ed esorta il Consiglio a conferire al Parlamento un ruolo pi\u00f9 importante nella sorveglianza della sua applicazione. Finora, le richieste del Parlamento non hanno ottenuto risposte soddisfacenti. Attualmente la clausola \u00e8 inserita in pi\u00f9 di cinquanta accordi e viene applicata a oltre centoventi paesi. A tale proposito, va sottolineata l\u2019importanza dell\u2019Accordo di Cotonou, firmato con i paesi ACP nel giugno del 2000, che ha potenziato il ruolo di questa clausola.\nIl primo punto che vorrei affrontare riguarda il Parlamento europeo. Esso deve dare il proprio parere conforme a un accordo prima della sua entrata in vigore, ma non \u00e8 chiamato a pronunciarsi sull\u2019avvio di una consultazione o sulla parziale sospensione di un accordo. Ci\u00f2 sminuisce il suo ruolo istituzionale e, pi\u00f9 in generale, politico.\nPer tale motivo ritengo importante sottolineare che il Parlamento non \u00e8 pi\u00f9 disposto a dare il proprio parere conforme a nuovi accordi internazionali che non contengono una clausola relativa ai diritti dell\u2019uomo e alla democrazia. Il Parlamento ritiene di dover partecipare alla definizione del mandato negoziale relativo ai nuovi accordi con paesi terzi e, soprattutto, all\u2019elaborazione delle loro finalit\u00e0 politiche e di promozione dei diritti umani. Inoltre, il Parlamento chiede di essere coinvolto nel processo decisionale concernente l\u2019avvio di una consultazione o la sospensione di un accordo, o ancora la sospensione di eventuali misure adeguate negative che sono gi\u00e0 state imposte a un paese. Infine, il Parlamento chiede di essere associato al Consiglio di associazione e alle sottocommissioni sui diritti umani e auspica che le sue delegazioni interparlamentari svolgano un ruolo rafforzato al riguardo, iscrivendo regolarmente all\u2019ordine del giorno delle riunioni discussioni sulla clausola democratica.\nUn altro punto che vorrei affrontare riguarda la reciprocit\u00e0 tra l\u2019Unione europea e i paesi terzi, che finora non \u00e8 stata pienamente sfruttata. Ritengo inoltre che la clausola debba essere applicata in relazione alla violazione di cui si discute e non in relazione al paese di cui si discute.\nE\u2019 altres\u00ec necessario estendere la clausola a tutti i nuovi accordi tra l\u2019Unione europea e i paesi terzi \u2013 industrializzati o in via di sviluppo \u2013 includendo gli accordi settoriali e gli aiuti commerciali, tecnici o finanziari, sull\u2019esempio di quanto \u00e8 stato realizzato finora per i paesi ACP.\nE\u2019 necessario prevedere l\u2019iscrizione sistematica delle questioni attinenti ai diritti umani all\u2019ordine del giorno del Consiglio di associazione.

Si chiede l\u2019istituzione generalizzata delle sottocommissioni sui diritti umani, incaricate di verificare il rispetto, l\u2019applicazione e l\u2019implementazione della clausola democratica, nonch\u00e9 di proporre azioni specifiche positive, volte al miglioramento della democrazia e dei diritti umani. E\u2019 importante sottolineare che si chiede l\u2019inclusione e la consultazione in queste sottocommissioni dei rappresentanti dei parlamenti e delle organizzazioni della societ\u00e0 civile.\nVi \u00e8 poi un ulteriore aspetto estremamente importante. Con questa risoluzione noi riconosciamo che finora l\u2019applicazione della clausola \u00e8 stata resa pi\u00f9 difficile dal requisito dell\u2019unanimit\u00e0 in seno al Consiglio per l\u2019avvio di una procedura di consultazione. Si chiede pertanto l\u2019abolizione dell\u2019unanimit\u00e0 e, a tal fine, la revisione dell\u2019articolo 300, paragrafo 2, del Trattato che istituisce la Comunit\u00e0 europea, che limita il ruolo del Parlamento europeo in questi casi.\nInfine, se da un lato si ritiene che la clausola debba essere applicata a tutti i paesi e a tutti gli accordi, dall\u2019altro lato si ritiene che con i paesi interessati dalla nuova politica di vicinato si potrebbe prevedere la firma di accordi che vadano oltre la clausola democratica, basati sulla condivisione di istituzioni comuni per la promozione dei principi democratici e dei diritti umani, sull\u2019esempio del Consiglio d\u2019Europa e degli accordi regionali.", "agenda_item": "The Human Rights and Democracy Clause (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060214-ITEM-004", "intervention_id": "2-008", "summary_english": "{\n\"headline\": \"MEP calls for strengthening European Parliament's role in human rights and democracy clause implementation and oversight\",\n\"issueSum\": \"The speaker addresses the long history of the human rights and democracy clause in EU policy, noting that despite Parliament's annual calls for greater weight and oversight role, responses have been unsatisfactory.

Mr President, I welcome this report on the human rights and democracy clause in European Union agreements prepared by the honourable Members of this House, and especially by Mr Agnoletto, and the resolution before Parliament today.\nHuman rights clauses have been inserted systematically into external agreements since 1995 and, ten years on, it is timely to take stock of what has been achieved. All EU institutions need to work together to this end, and I emphasise my commitment to an ongoing, but also very practical, dialogue with the Council and Parliament, for which this report provides a good basis.\nI shall begin by underlining how much has already been achieved: it must be said that the glass is more than half full. After often difficult discussions and very difficult negotiations, the Commission has secured the inclusion of a human rights and democracy clause in, as you said, more than 50 agreements, covering over 120 countries. A notable example is, indeed, that of Articles 9 and 96 of the Cotonou Agreement. In the field of trade policy, the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance, known as \u2018GSP+\u2019, provides additional benefits for countries that implement, inter alia , certain international standards in human and social rights; so it is a positive incentive.\nThe impact of human rights clauses is already evident, and many of our human rights activities are supported by their mere existence. Human rights feature prominently in every political dialogue with our partners. Human rights subcommittees are being established with a growing number of partners, and, indeed, the European Union Neighbourhood Policy Action Plans contain highly detailed sections on human rights.\nThe Commission, as part of the troika, makes numerous d\u00e9marches on human rights issues every year, and the European Initiative on Democracy and Human Rights funds human rights projects throughout the world. The Commission is also funding numerous technical assistance projects with an impact on human rights, ranging from, for instance, improving police training to modernising the judicial system in partner countries. The rule of law is one of the most important areas where I think we can really make a difference.\nI would also like to mention how active both Member State embassies and Commission delegations are in this regard. EU Heads of Mission collectively draw up human rights fact sheets periodically, report on the implementation of the various EU human rights guidelines and make detailed analyses of developments in particular countries concerning human rights and democracy. More and more frequently, political reporting from the Commission delegations is covering human rights issues.\nAssessing the effectiveness of the human rights clause to date needs to be done in a comprehensive manner. The human rights and democracy clause is, in itself, an important way of demonstrating the shared commitment of the European Union and its partners to upholding, and also to promoting, human rights. The human rights clause opens the door to developing a deeper and more intensive dialogue on human rights issues. Moreover, the existence of these clauses may, in some cases, even help deter potential human rights violations.\nAs far as sanctions are concerned, I would like to underline that the frequency of imposition clearly depends less on the wording of the human rights clause than on the political will of the Member States, as well as of the other states. I agree that, when sanctions are not implemented in response to serious breaches of human rights, the credibility of the EU\u2019s human rights policy could be damaged.\nFor its part, the Commission would sometimes like to see a more robust use of these clauses but the solution is not, however, to include more clauses in the agreement. Instead, we need to build up awareness and the consensus throughout the European Union on the importance of human rights issues relative to other priorities. This report therefore makes a valuable contribution in this regard.\nAs regards Parliament\u2019s involvement in negotiating or suspending an agreement, you will be well aware that these procedures are clearly established by the Treaty and reflect the interinstitutional structure of the European Union. Parliament already plays an invaluable role in focusing attention on human rights issues, through the extremely active work of the Subcommittee on Human Rights, through its annual report on human rights in the world and through the many resolutions and debates on particular human rights issues. Moreover, I very much welcome the suggestion that interparliamentary delegations should take up human rights issues much more systematically. I think that there, too, you have a great role to play.\nI also favour revising the format of the current EU Annual Report on Human Rights in order to make it a fully interinstitutional report and to include an analysis of the application of human rights clauses.\nIn conclusion, let me reiterate that the success of human rights clauses should be measured by the progress made in engaging partners in a genuine dialogue and in consultations on human rights, and the resulting improvements in human rights.\nOver the last ten years, human rights clauses have provided an indispensable foundation for developing a truly effective human rights dialogue with our partners because it is in this way that these countries slowly change their behaviour. That does not mean, of course, that there is no room for improvement: there is always room for improvement, and I look forward to this debate today and to an ongoing and active debate with Parliament.

Mr President, I welcome this report on the human rights and democracy clause in European Union agreements prepared by the honourable Members of this House, and especially by Mr Agnoletto, and the resolution before Parliament today.\nHuman rights clauses have been inserted systematically into external agreements since 1995 and, ten years on, it is timely to take stock of what has been achieved. All EU institutions need to work together to this end, and I emphasise my commitment to an ongoing, but also very practical, dialogue with the Council and Parliament, for which this report provides a good basis.\nI shall begin by underlining how much has already been achieved: it must be said that the glass is more than half full. After often difficult discussions and very difficult negotiations, the Commission has secured the inclusion of a human rights and democracy clause in, as you said, more than 50 agreements, covering over 120 countries. A notable example is, indeed, that of Articles 9 and 96 of the Cotonou Agreement. In the field of trade policy, the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance, known as \u2018GSP+\u2019, provides additional benefits for countries that implement, inter alia , certain international standards in human and social rights; so it is a positive incentive.\nThe impact of human rights clauses is already evident, and many of our human rights activities are supported by their mere existence. Human rights feature prominently in every political dialogue with our partners. Human rights subcommittees are being established with a growing number of partners, and, indeed, the European Union Neighbourhood Policy Action Plans contain highly detailed sections on human rights.\nThe Commission, as part of the troika, makes numerous d\u00e9marches on human rights issues every year, and the European Initiative on Democracy and Human Rights funds human rights projects throughout the world. The Commission is also funding numerous technical assistance projects with an impact on human rights, ranging from, for instance, improving police training to modernising the judicial system in partner countries. The rule of law is one of the most important areas where I think we can really make a difference.\nI would also like to mention how active both Member State embassies and Commission delegations are in this regard. EU Heads of Mission collectively draw up human rights fact sheets periodically, report on the implementation of the various EU human rights guidelines and make detailed analyses of developments in particular countries concerning human rights and democracy. More and more frequently, political reporting from the Commission delegations is covering human rights issues.\nAssessing the effectiveness of the human rights clause to date needs to be done in a comprehensive manner. The human rights and democracy clause is, in itself, an important way of demonstrating the shared commitment of the European Union and its partners to upholding, and also to promoting, human rights. The human rights clause opens the door to developing a deeper and more intensive dialogue on human rights issues. Moreover, the existence of these clauses may, in some cases, even help deter potential human rights violations.\nAs far as sanctions are concerned, I would like to underline that the frequency of imposition clearly depends less on the wording of the human rights clause than on the political will of the Member States, as well as of the other states. I agree that, when sanctions are not implemented in response to serious breaches of human rights, the credibility of the EU\u2019s human rights policy could be damaged.\nFor its part, the Commission would sometimes like to see a more robust use of these clauses but the solution is not, however, to include more clauses in the agreement. Instead, we need to build up awareness and the consensus throughout the European Union on the importance of human rights issues relative to other priorities. This report therefore makes a valuable contribution in this regard.\nAs regards Parliament\u2019s involvement in negotiating or suspending an agreement, you will be well aware that these procedures are clearly established by the Treaty and reflect the interinstitutional structure of the European Union. Parliament already plays an invaluable role in focusing attention on human rights issues, through the extremely active work of the Subcommittee on Human Rights, through its annual report on human rights in the world and through the many resolutions and debates on particular human rights issues. Moreover, I very much welcome the suggestion that interparliamentary delegations should take up human rights issues much more systematically. I think that there, too, you have a great role to play.\nI also favour revising the format of the current EU Annual Report on Human Rights in order to make it a fully interinstitutional report and to include an analysis of the application of human rights clauses.\nIn conclusion, let me reiterate that the success of human rights clauses should be measured by the progress made in engaging partners in a genuine dialogue and in consultations on human rights, and the resulting improvements in human rights.\nOver the last ten years, human rights clauses have provided an indispensable foundation for developing a truly effective human rights dialogue with our partners because it is in this way that these countries slowly change their behaviour. That does not mean, of course, that there is no room for improvement: there is always room for improvement, and I look forward to this debate today and to an ongoing and active debate with Parliament. We are in a listening mood, but we would also like to contribute to improving human rights in the world.\n(Applause)"}, {"speaker": "Fernando Fern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00edn (PPE-DE),", "english": "Fernando Fern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00edn (PPE-DE), draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development . \u2013 (ES) Mr President, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, ladies and gentlemen, the inclusion of a human rights clause in our international agreements is one of the European Union\u2019s distinguishing features.

Finally, he is right in his final conclusion that the time has come, at long last, for us to look at a new clause with a content which reflects everything we are debating and everything that we commend on many occasions or that, on other occasions, we criticise through the European process.\nThe Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has, as you know, tabled an amendment which, as far as I understand, Mr Agnoletto accepts and, consequently, it supports his report.", "lang": "EL", "original": "\u0393\u03b9\u03ce\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 \u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03b7\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2, \u03b5\u03be \u03bf\u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u039f\u03bc\u03ac\u03b4\u03b1\u03c2 PPE-DE . \u2013 \u039a\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03b5 \u03a0\u03c1\u03cc\u03b5\u03b4\u03c1\u03b5, \u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 \u0395\u03c0\u03af\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03b5, \u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03af\u03b5\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9 \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03ac\u03b4\u03b5\u03bb\u03c6\u03bf\u03b9, \u03b8\u03ad\u03bb\u03c9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u2019 \u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03ac\u03c2 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c3\u03c5\u03b3\u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03ce \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03b5\u03b9\u03c3\u03b7\u03b3\u03b7\u03c4\u03ae, \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03ba.

policies of the parties and constitutes an essential element of the European Union\u2019s international agreements.\nThe cumbersome and vague wording of the democratic clause to which I have just referred has many limitations and lacks the mechanisms required to ensure that it functions properly. The result is that the clause is often used as an alibi or rhetorical example, without having any real consequences.\nThe report we are debating today is intended to put an end to this situation, increasing the effectiveness of the clause from a legal point of view. To this end, we Socialists have made several proposals that have been taken up in this report, something about which we are very pleased. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Mr Agnoletto and thank him for his work and understanding.\nWe do not want to be under any illusions, though. This initiative report will once again come face to face with reality when we come to applying the clause.\nThe European Union must promote the introduction of the clause in line with the recommendations of this report, and that is what we are calling for today in this House. We shall continue to need great political will on the part of the Union so that respect for human rights genuinely provides added value in international agreements and in the promotion of dignity and so that the introduction of the clause is not a dead letter and so that it is not used in a hypocritical fashion and only applied when it suits our interests. For this, we need Europe to have a genuine commitment to human rights; an effective, credible and coherent commitment.\nWe can implement a warning system to identify human rights violations which allows us to act appropriately and react in time. Europe must maintain reciprocity in the application of the human rights clause, because we must be able to maintain a frank and open dialogue with the countries with which we have reached agreements, and we must also be able to listen to the criticisms of partner countries, in relation to how we Europeans treat their nationals, for example, and react accordingly.\nEurope must maintain a credible position. Human rights cannot be used as a bargaining chip. We cannot stop defending them for the sake of other topical interests. Europe must act in an honest and clear fashion. We must call for an end to the death penalty in India, China, Japan and the United States.

However, in those ten years the EU has been criticised for failing to put its human rights tools in the field of external relations into practice and it has become increasingly apparent that when dealing with key countries, strategic partnerships and double standards of Realpolitik still eclipse the fundamental human rights which this clause seeks to protect.\nBy way of illustration, I make reference to the fact that, despite what we demand on paper, the debate sparked by the election of the new Palestinian Authority clearly spelled out that implementation depends primarily on the political will of the EU to assign priority to human rights issues over economic and political interests. Before the democratically elected Authority had the chance to organise itself, the EU-Palestine Agreement was up for review on the basis of human rights in a way that has been dismissed by both the Council and the Commission as unhelpful because it would remove leverage. However, when probed about the EU-Israel Association Agreement, despite Israel\u2019s catalogue of defiance of Security Council resolutions and blatant disregard of the International Court of Justice, as she continues to annex East Jerusalem and deny the Palestinian people the right to self-determination, what is the EU\u2019s response?\nI have been a harsh critic of the handling of the EU-Israel Association Agreement, scrutinising the precise application of the human rights clause on numerous occasions on the floor of this House. Yet I hear nothing other than euphemisms, such as that we must maintain our influence and continue our dialogue. If the Council and the Commission cannot spell out to this House how it uses the human rights clause coherently, effectively and transparently, then how can it expect this House to be prepared to give its assent to new international agreements?\nThe vague criterion and inadequate procedures contained in this instrument have not helped me to penetrate the logic behind some EU decisions, nor does it help the EU to defend itself against accusations of ambivalence and discrimination in the face of serious human rights violations. A revised text must provide a concrete, step-by-step implemented mechanism, from dialogue to warning signals, and a spectrum of tools from smart sanctions to suspension, to add influence and authority to our interventions with persistent violators. Moreover, the instrument should be based on the principle of reciprocity with regard to abuses that take place on EU soil as well as those abroad. If anything has become clear from the controversy over unlawful CIA operations in Europe, it is that when it comes to human rights, the EU has failed to keep its own house in order.\nThe significance of this latest twist in the war on terror cannot be exaggerated, effectively shattering EU complacency about its own human rights record, with enquiries launched by the Council of Europe and this House with warnings that the sanctioning mechanism of Article\u00a07 may be used.

Mr\u00a0Agnoletto's report puts forward some important proposals that, as you can see, have garnered extremely broad consensus here in Parliament. This clause does suffer from some deficiencies. First of all, there is a lack of uniformity: the wording of the clause may vary from one type of agreement to another. I, and the rapporteur, would advocate a better clause, in order to increase its political and legal impact. It must, for example, be clearly established that the parties to these agreements are required to comply with the international standards and obligations incumbent on them.\nSecondly, in most cases, as has already been stressed, this clause suffers from a lack of concrete enforcement methods. In order to be consistent, the European Union must establish such methods. We cannot expect to retain our credibility in the eyes of our partners if, on the one hand, we claim to want respect for human rights to be an essential part of our policy but, on the other, we do not take the necessary measures if these countries systematically violate those rights. At the moment, the ACP agreements probably form the most advanced model, which should be our inspiration.\nThe mechanisms for enforcing the clause must also be graduated. We must not see them just as reprimands for human rights violations, but also as ways of helping to strengthen human rights in third countries. That is why the positive approach of the human rights clause is so important.\nWith regard to Parliament's role, in order to guarantee that our policy is consistent, credible and transparent, it is absolutely vital for us to be involved at all the stages of enforcing the clause. When Parliament's resolutions refer to the clause, or call for appropriate measures to be taken, the Council should take heed of these calls and assess whether they are appropriate.\nThe second vital point is the link between the clause and the structures for political dialogue. The link between this clause and the creation of 'human rights' subcommittees must be clear, and these committees should also be strengthened. I also find it regrettable in this connection that the European Union's requirements have been relaxed, particularly for certain of our neighbours. If we want to implement this clause effectively, we must create the forums needed for a frank and constructive exchange of views on human rights.\nWith regard to the reciprocity principle, this dialogue must also be reciprocal, particularly at a time when some of our Member States are having fingers pointed at them because of their anti-terrorism policy, for example, or because of inhumane prison conditions. We must be able to listen to any criticisms our partners may make.\nFinally, it is important that human rights must not be a matter just for our ministers of foreign affairs, but for all government bodies. That is why I, like the rapporteur, am advocating that the clause be an 'essential element' in all agreements and, finally, that Parliament should no longer give its assent to new agreements that do not contain a human rights and democracy clause.", "lang": "FR", "original": "H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Flautre, au nom du groupe Verts/ALE . - Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, la clause dont nous discutons aujourd\u2019hui constitue le fondement et la l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 de l\u2019action de l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne aupr\u00e8s des \u00c9tats tiers en mati\u00e8re de respect des droits de l\u2019homme.

Secondly, we should draw on the positive experiences that have emerged so far from the Cotonou Agreement, and ensure that clauses on upholding human rights and democratic principles are included in all sectoral agreements or all agreements with developed states, in order to achieve a level playing field for all parties to the Agreement. Thirdly, it is necessary to place greater emphasis on implementing so-called positive measures to motivate states, and to use negative measures only where absolutely necessary, where other options have been exhausted. When weighing up such options it is clearly necessary to consider the impact of the measures on ordinary citizens.\nIn my view, one of the key factors from the standpoint of ensuring transparency is for the European Parliament and civil society to play a greater role in the implementation of clauses relating to human rights and democratic principles. The work of the Commission and Council has so far had little transparency, and has often been misleading, giving rise to concerns that political, strategic and commercial interests are over-ruling the consistent implementation of clearly defined standards. It is absolutely necessary, if we are to increase transparency and democratisation in decision-making processes, for the European Commission to inform Parliament and interested parties in the public sphere regularly, ideally on an annual basis, about the implementation of clauses dealing with the upholding of human rights and democratic principles, including studies of individual cases and of the approach taken by the Council over a given period, the success of given measures and suggested approaches for the future, in case a situation does not improve.

It is true that what is known as the human rights and democracy clause has been incorporated into more than 50 agreements and that this affects 120 countries, but it is also the case that the degree to which it is complied with or the degree to which we demand that it be complied with varies considerably.\nAfter ten years of applying this system, therefore, we must take stock and take certain corrective measures, and I would therefore congratulate Mr Agnoletto on his work, on his report and on his conclusions, with which we agree, naturally.\nFirstly, I would like to stress that we must remember that many agreements with developed countries and sectoral agreements, such as those relating to textile products, agriculture and fisheries, do not yet contain such a clause, and that is clearly a deficiency.\nSecondly, although the clause applies both to the European Union and to the third country, full use has not yet been made of its reciprocal dimension and, as Mrs Valenciano Mart\u00ednez-Orozco has said, I believe that the European Union must begin by offering an example.\nThirdly, one of the factors that have compromised its application is the generic nature of its wording, since it does not provide for precise methods for positive or negative intervention in cooperation between the European Union and third countries, leading to the Council\u2019s demands and the national demands of the Member States taking precedence over more general human rights demands.\nFor all of these reasons, we support the drawing up of a new text for a model clause to improve the current wording of the so-called Article 2, with a view to guaranteeing a more coherent, effective and transparent approach to European human rights policy in the agreements with third countries.\n(Applause)", "lang": "ES", "original": "Ra\u00fcl Romeva i Rueda (Verts/ALE). \u2013 (ES) Se\u00f1or Presidente, me satisface realmente el alto grado de consenso que hay en esta C\u00e1mara en cuanto al hecho de que el desarrollo y la consolidaci\u00f3n de la democracia y del Estado de Derecho, as\u00ed como el respeto de los derechos humanos y de las libertades fundamentales, son \u2014aunque deben serlo m\u00e1s\u2014 un objetivo global de la pol\u00edtica exterior y de seguridad com\u00fan, y deben ser parte integrante de la pol\u00edtica exterior de la Uni\u00f3n Europea.\nY digo que deben serlo m\u00e1s porque, como se ha dicho, son numerosos, demasiados, los ejemplos en que estos principios quedan matizados, cuando no anulados, en favor de determinados intereses econ\u00f3micos, comerciales o pol\u00edticos particulares.

In theory, you can say what you like about mass immigration, but if you oppose it, you are condemned for incitement to racial hatred. If, as happened recently, you mention the islamisation of Alsace, even as an elected representative, you become the target of disgraceful condemnations that only reflect badly on those who made them.

For having contested this law during a political press conference, I myself have lost, at least temporarily, my post at the University of Lyon. If you say you prefer natural families to homosexual partnerships, you risk being condemned once again, as a member of the French parliament from the majority party found out recently. A mayor does not have the right to give a fellow countryman preference over a foreigner when allocating social housing, nor can an individual give this sort of preference in any field. I could give you more examples.\nEvery group, every lobby, every minority and every deviancy has developed its own methods of pressurising, intimidating and persecuting the majority, with the active or passive complicity of the authorities.

I shall confine myself, for reasons of time, to five of them.\nFirst question: will the Union continue to confine itself to the more or less declaratory character of the human rights and democracy clause or will it try \u2013 and this is my proposal \u2013 to raise the democracy principle to an appropriate legal means, into a sine qua non for the smooth functioning of agreements with third countries?\nSecond question: are the selective discounts of the democracy clause permissible? Is the differentiated intensity in the formulation of the principle in question permissible? The answer is obvious. The credibility of the invocation of democracy, the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms must obey the rule of uniform standards.\nThird question: do the elements of electoral competition and free elections alone suffice in order to characterise a system as democratic? Modern democratic life makes demands intertwined with the quality of democracy. It makes the demand of participatory civil rights, of horizontal political accountability. It makes the demand of honest governance, of institutional security and of social cohesion.\nFourth question: does the Union intend \u2013 do we the democratically legitimised Chamber par excellence intend \u2013 to adopt qualitative indicators for measuring and evaluating the democratic conduct of our private economic and commercial partners and, more importantly, of third European countries which are being called on, or will be called on, to satisfy the so-called Copenhagen criteria?\nFifth and last question: in European external relations, the democratic principle and the market economy are cited along side each other or in the same breath, but in practice the market economy claims priority.

They contend that modern democratic life demands quality democracy including participatory political rights, horizontal political accountability, good governance, institutional security and social cohesion, going beyond just free elections.\",\n  \"propSum\": \"The speaker proposes elevating the democratic principle to a proper legal instrument and sine qua non condition for EU agreements with third countries. They suggest establishing qualitative indicators to measure and evaluate democratic behavior of economic and commercial partners, particularly third European states that must satisfy the Copenhagen criteria.

in turn should like to start by congratulating my honourable friend Mr Agnoletto on the important report which he has presented to us.\nThe incorporation of a human rights clause in the agreements of the European Union, since the beginning of the 1990s, has been a politically and institutionally cutting edge. However, in taking stock today, we must be honest and say that the results are not particularly positive. This is due mainly to the lack of political will on the part of the Member States, as the Commissioner so honestly and boldly said, to selective sensitivity to the application of the clause, to the prevalence of double standards and, finally, to the supremacy of national interests and expediencies over the common and decisive stand of the European Union.\n\u03a4here are numerous examples and this situation is creating a serious problem of credibility of the European institutions among European citizens. On the one hand, the European Union can freeze relations and agreements \u2013 Mr Ford spoke and gave examples \u2013 and, on the other hand, it does nothing about infringements of human rights in Tunisia, Egypt, Israel or Turkey. Strategic interests take precedence in relations with Russia, China and the United States over respect for human rights and minority rights.\nThe provision of unanimity for the taking of measures and the suspension of an agreement will continue to cancel in practice any serious effort. The European Union will not be able to engage in a dynamic foreign policy with the unanimity procedure. This dimension needs to be retabled in the debate on the future of Europe. I agree with all the proposals made by my honourable friend, Mr Agnoletto. However, we must understand that the serious deficit in foreign policy and in human rights policy is due to and connected with the transnational character and unanimity provision, behind which hide national interests and various political expediencies and priorities.

It is evident from the responses to it that it enjoys very widespread approval. We have already heard from various quarters how much easier we find it to criticise small states such as Myanmar and impose sanctions on them to do the same with large ones, where economic interests come into play. This is where we have a problem, a dilemma, and it is one that we should address frankly instead of beating about the bush. The European Union has a credibility problem, a problem with double standards, and this is something we have to consider in the present situation with these caricatures and what is claimed to be a clash of civilisations. We very much agree with many of the points made in this report.\nI would like to point out, though, that we will be addressing a similar issue \u2013 that of the Fundamental Rights Agency \u2013 in a forthcoming debate in this House. That Agency will deal with many of the issues with which we are concerning ourselves today. I would like to raise Members\u2019 awareness of the fact that we will be able to use this Fundamental Rights Agency not only to improve the protection of human rights within the European Union\u2019s Member States, but also as a sort of early warning system to inform us what is going on in the states around us and how things stand as regards human rights in them. This presents us with a unique opportunity to improve Europe\u2019s policy on human rights.

Wir haben hier ein Problem, ein Dilemma. Wir sollten es offen ansprechen und nicht um den hei\u00dfen Brei herumreden. Die Europ\u00e4ische Union hat ein Glaubw\u00fcrdigkeitsproblem, ein Problem mit doppelten Standards. Mit diesem Thema m\u00fcssen wir uns gerade jetzt in der aktuellen Situation besch\u00e4ftigen, wo es um Karikaturen, wo es um den angeblichen Kampf der Kulturen usw. geht. Viele Punkte, die in diesem Bericht angesprochen werden, finden die ausdr\u00fcckliche Zustimmung.\nIch m\u00f6chte aber auf eine Debatte hinweisen, die wir demn\u00e4chst in diesem Hause f\u00fchren werden und die uns mit einem \u00e4hnlichen Thema besch\u00e4ftigen wird, n\u00e4mlich mit der Grundrechteagentur. Viele der Punkte, die uns heute hier besch\u00e4ftigen, werden in der Europ\u00e4ischen Grundrechteagentur angesprochen. Ich m\u00f6chte die Kolleginnen und Kollegen daf\u00fcr sensibilisieren, dass wir diese Grundrechteagentur nutzen, um den Menschenrechtsschutz innerhalb der Mitgliedstaaten der Europ\u00e4ischen Union zu verbessern, aber auch quasi als eine Art early warning system , was unsere Nachbarl\u00e4nder und das Verh\u00e4ltnis der Menschenrechte dort angeht. Hier haben wir eine einmalige M\u00f6glichkeit zur Verbesserung der europ\u00e4ischen Menschenrechtspolitik.

That strikes me as not very realistic and in any case not very desirable, certainly when developing countries would be invited to criticise the reception of their own nationals who apply for asylum in Europe. We should, in fact, make a point of encouraging such states to take back those of their nationals who do not qualify for political asylum over here.

Sadly, their efforts to further their own interests often prevent the Union from taking effective action.\nThe task before us today is to ensure that human rights clauses are introduced in a way that will make it possible for us to exert effective pressure on third countries. It is no longer enough to simply make a statement of principles and requirements. They need to be implemented, and that calls for a great deal of courage and determination.\nI have been saddened to note that the behaviour of the Union\u2019s leaders tends to be governed by fear and opportunism. All too often economic and political interests outweigh the need for a swift response to notorious cases where individuals are humiliated and their freedom restricted. The principle of solidarity must not be treated as if it were a ballast to be jettisoned at any time. It needs to become a crucial instrument of the European Union\u2019s policy.\nThe human rights clauses must therefore be equipped with appropriate means of persuasion and of exerting political pressure. That, in turn, requires a change in the approach to the Common Foreign and Security Policy. A permanent feature of this policy should be an ongoing struggle to defend the principles of freedom and democracy.\nWe urgently need European institutions modelled on American government-funded foundations and which are able to effectively support human rights defenders the world over. No such institutions exist at present, but the planned EU Fundamental Rights Agency should help to fill this gap. Indeed, the Human Rights Agency would be a more appropriate title for this body.\nIn its annual report, the human rights organisation Human Rights Watch concluded that during 2005 the European Union\u2019s main interests had been in the fields of business, politics and energy.\nMere verbal criticism of totalitarian and dictatorial regimes is no longer enough. The European Union must demonstrate the will to implement fundamental rights the world over. Is there anyone in the European Union currently dealing with the restrictions on freedom of expression and the activities of non-governmental organisations in Russia? Is anyone prepared to sacrifice trade contracts with China in exchange for the release of Tibetan monks imprisoned for alleged subversive activities? Will we eventually be able to bring ourselves to stand up to the Cuban regime?\nIn conclusion, I should like to express my support for the protest action against the Google search engine. I do not intend to use it today. Google has set up a special version of its search engine for Chinese pages, controlled by the Chinese Government.

The Union\u2019s foreign policy is aimed at creating a global world order based on peace, democracy, human rights, the rule of law, sustainable development and stable growth.\nThe human rights and democracy clause should now be applied more widely and included in all agreements entered into by the European Union with third countries, regardless of whether they are industrialised or developing countries. The aforementioned clause should also feature in sectoral agreements, trade exchanges, and technical and financial aid. Pursuant to this clause, the relevant European Union institutions, including the European Parliament, should have the authority to effectively monitor respect for human rights and democratic principles by parties to agreements with the European Union. In this respect, it is important to bear in mind the relationship between respect for human rights, democracy and development. General principles encompassing the protection of human rights, the rule of law and respect for democratic values are a sine qua non for the eradication of poverty.\nA good way of dealing with this issue would be to include in such agreements a recommendation that the EU and the country party to the agreement should exchange reports on human rights on an annual basis. It would also be desirable to set up a mechanism for consultation with non-governmental organisations. Election monitoring missions play a vital part in protecting and supporting human rights and democracy beyond the Union\u2019s borders, as does the aid the Union should provide to civil society in third countries.", "lang": "PL", "original": "J\u00f3zef Pinior (PSE). \u2013 Panie Przewodnicz\u0105cy!

It is clear beyond doubt that human rights are universal rights and that no dictator or State is entitled to deny human beings the smallest aspect of their fundamental rights. The problem is that of how Europe is to make use of its resources to try to export these noble aims. In this area, we sometimes criticise Europe for not employing its rights and its power, including economic power, and, at the same time, we criticise the administration or the institutions for closing their eyes to certain shortcomings. There is a decision to be made. We have to decide whether it is by using persuasion or economic power that Europe can best export its aims.

Mr President, this has been a very valuable discussion on the human rights clause and on human rights and democracy in general.\nLet us not forget that human rights issues are already being raised systematically with partners in political dialogues. We have established dedicated human rights dialogue and consultations with certain countries, and human rights subcommittees have also been established. In other cases, human rights may be raised at association councils and at association committee meetings.\nThe purpose of the human rights clause is not simply to make it possible to impose sanctions, but also to create a basis for human rights dialogue and for the setting-up of institutions concerned with it, because we need to give such institutions a chance and encourage them to develop. Institution building is as important as the clause, and the existence of the human rights clause in the association agreement, or in partnership and cooperation agreements, creates the basis for this. Therefore there is no need to replicate this in sectoral agreements.\nI also want to recall that our agreements have a wide range of policy goals. We want to contribute to stability and to the increase of welfare for all the populations concerned. It is not a lack of courage if we do not always have the same human rights clause or if we do not apply sanctions. We also have to contribute to the development of a population \u2013 look at the African, and some Asian, populations, as some of you mentioned. There is also freedom from want and freedom from fear, which are closely related to human rights and to the human security concept. That means we cannot throw the baby out with the bathwater. There are many other clauses to defend, such as the clause against terrorism, the clause against weapons of mass destruction and the clause for democracy. It is all interlinked and we cannot focus only on human rights; we have to see the whole picture, which includes poverty eradication. This is the difficult balance that we have to strike sometimes.\nIt is not easy to harmonise this clause, because we are negotiating with every partner and we have to find solutions in the end. Not every partner accepts exactly the same wording. However, it is not so much about wording but about application and the way we can encourage the partners to come up with their own solutions, because, as we have always made clear, we do not want to impose everything on the others: we want to encourage their societies to build and to change.\nAs I have already said, institution building is just as important, as are legal, judicial and police reform, because that is where human rights are applied.\nFinally, I should like to say that, with all due respect, in many individual cases we have been able to get people out of prison and to talk about them. We speak about the death penalty with each and every partner, we speak against torture, and slowly these things come through. Maybe sometimes the issue is speed \u2013 not everything is being done at the same time. But let us be realistic: we cannot change the world in a day."}, {"speaker": "President.", "english": "President.

Debate Information\n\n**Date:** February 14, 2006  \n**Number of Contributions:** 39 interventions from 32 speakers  \n**Topic:** Review and strengthening of the human rights and democracy clause in European Union agreements with third countries  \n**Report by:** Vittorio Agnoletto (GUE/NGL) on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs\n\n## 2. Executive Summary\n\n### Core Issues Identified\n\nThe debate centered on reforming the EU's human rights and democracy clause, which has been incorporated into over 50 agreements covering 120+ countries since the 1990s. Key issues included: inconsistent implementation due to political and economic interests; limited Parliamentary oversight; the need for better enforcement mechanisms; and questions about the clause's effectiveness in promoting genuine human rights improvements.\n\n### Positions and Arguments\n\n**The Rapporteur's Vision**  \nVittorio Agnoletto presented comprehensive reform proposals, arguing that \"Parliament is no longer prepared to give its assent to new international agreements that do not contain a human rights and democracy clause\" [Agnoletto, 2006-02-14]. He advocated for enhanced Parliamentary involvement, abolition of unanimity requirements, and extension of clauses to all agreement types.\n\n**Commission's Defensive Stance**  \nCommissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner took a more cautious position, acknowledging shortcomings while defending existing approaches. She argued that \"the purpose of the human rights clause is not simply to make it possible to impose sanctions, but also to create a basis for human rights dialogue and for the setting-up of institutions\" [Ferrero-Waldner, 2006-02-14]. The Commission emphasized institution-building over sanctions and warned against unrealistic expectations.\n\n**Parliamentary Consensus on Strengthening**  \nMost MEPs supported strengthening the clause but differed on methods. The Development Committee's Fernando Fern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00edn praised the Cotonou Agreement model, noting \"we would stress the exemplary values of the Cotonou Agreement, given its extensive application to 77 countries and the effectiveness and flexibility of the suspensory clause\" [Fern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00edn, 2006-02-14].\n\n**Critical Voices on Implementation**  \nSeveral speakers criticized selective application. Mar\u00eda Elena Valenciano Mart\u00ednez-Orozco warned that \"human rights cannot be used as a bargaining chip. We cannot stop defending them for the sake of other topical interests\" [Valenciano Mart\u00ednez-Orozco, 2006-02-14]. Richard Howitt provided specific examples, stating he found it \"breathtaking that the UK Independence Party this morning said that we could turn a blind eye to human rights violations with China simply because we trade effectively with it\" [Howitt, 2006-02-14].\n\n**Institutional Reform Demands**  \nMultiple speakers called for structural changes. Panagiotis Beglitis argued that \"strategic interests take precedence in relations with Russia, China and the United States over respect for human rights and minority rights\" [Beglitis, 2006-02-14]. He advocated ending unanimity requirements that allow individual member states to block action.\n\n### Key Proposals\n\n**Enhanced Parliamentary Role:** Speakers widely supported giving Parliament greater involvement in negotiating mandates, monitoring implementation, and decision-making on consultations and suspensions.\n\n**Broader Application:** Strong consensus emerged for extending clauses to all EU agreements, including sectoral agreements in agriculture, fisheries, and textiles.\n\n**Improved Mechanisms:** Proposals included creating human rights subcommittees, establishing early warning systems, developing country-specific strategy documents, and implementing reciprocity principles.\n\n**Institutional Changes:** Several MEPs called for abolishing unanimity requirements in Council decisions and revising Treaty provisions that limit Parliamentary roles.\n\n### Dissenting Views\n\nGerard Batten (IND/DEM) offered the strongest dissent, arguing the approach was \"impractical\" and questioning whether \"we are going to turn the tide of history by telling China to turn into a democratic country with full human rights overnight\" [Batten, 2006-02-14]. He advocated for leading by example rather than conditional requirements.\n\nBruno Gollnisch criticized EU hypocrisy, arguing that \"before we go looking for the speck in our neighbour's eye, should we not remove the plank from our own\" [Gollnisch, 2006-02-14], citing restrictions on free expression within Europe.\n\n### Actionable Outcomes\n\nThe debate revealed strong Parliamentary support for comprehensive reform of human rights clauses, with most speakers endorsing the Agnoletto report's recommendations. Key areas for action include:\n\n1. **Immediate:** Refuse consent to new agreements lacking human rights clauses\n2. **Short-term:** Develop standardized clause language and monitoring mechanisms  \n3. **Medium-term:** Negotiate enhanced Parliamentary roles in future Treaty revisions\n4. **Long-term:** Build institutional capacity for systematic human rights promotion\n\nThe debate demonstrated broad consensus that the EU's human rights policy requires more consistency, stronger enforcement mechanisms, and genuine commitment to placing human rights considerations above economic and political expediency. As Simon Coveney noted, \"if the truth be told, however, in many cases human rights clauses in EU agreements with third countries have not been worth the paper they were written on\" [Coveney, 2006-02-14], highlighting the urgent need for meaningful reform.", "src_model": "claude", "model_type": "claude", "model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "structured": false, "incremental": false, "hierarchical": false, "grouped": false, "shuffle": false, "prompt": false, "lang": "original"}
