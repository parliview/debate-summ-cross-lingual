Every year, in its annual report, the European Parliament calls for this clause to be given greater weight and urges the Council to grant Parliament a more important role in overseeing its implementation. Parliament\u2019s requests have so far not been met with a satisfactory response. The clause has now been included in over 50 agreements and applies to over 120 countries. In that respect, I must stress the importance of the Cotonou Agreement signed with the ACP countries in June 2000, which enhanced the role of this clause.\nThe first point that I should like to address concerns the European Parliament. It has to give its assent before an agreement comes into force, but it is not called upon to give its opinion on initiating consultation or partly suspending an agreement. That lessens its institutional and, more generally, its political role.\nThat is why I consider it important to emphasise that Parliament is no longer prepared to give its assent to new international agreements that do not contain a human rights and democracy clause. Parliament maintains that it has to play a part in defining the negotiating mandate for new agreements with third countries and, above all, in drafting their political and human rights objectives. In addition, Parliament asks to be involved in the decision-making process for initiating consultation or suspending an agreement, or indeed for suspending any appropriate negative measures that have already been imposed on a country. Lastly, Parliament asks to be associated with the Association Councils and their subcommittees on human rights and hopes that its interparliamentary delegations can play an enhanced role in that respect, by regularly including debates on the democracy clause on their meeting agendas.\nAnother point that I should like to address concerns the reciprocity between the European Union and third countries, which so far has not been fully exploited. I also believe that the clause should be applied in relation to the violation under discussion and not in relation to the country under discussion.\nIt is also necessary to extend the clause to all new agreements between the European Union and third countries, both industrialised and developing, including sectoral agreements and commercial, technical or financial aid, along the lines of what has been done for the ACP countries.\nHuman rights issues need to be systematically included on Association Council agendas. To that end, we consider that the heads of the Commission\u2019s external delegations in third countries must play an enhanced role and we call for country-by-country multiannual strategy documents to be drawn up and to be debated on a regular basis.\nA structured dialogue must be established between the Association Council and its subcommittee on human rights. We call for the general establishment of subcommittees on human rights, with a mandate to review compliance with and the application and implementation of the democracy clause, and to propose specific positive actions to improve democracy and human rights. It is important to underline that we call for these subcommittees to include and to consult representatives of parliaments and of organisations representing civil society.\nThen there is a further extremely important aspect. This resolution recognises that the need for unanimity within the Council in order to initiate a consultation procedure has made it more difficult to apply the clause. We therefore call for the abolition of this unanimity requirement and, in that respect, for the revision of Article 300(2) of the EC Treaty, which limits the role of the European Parliament in such cases.\nLastly, while we believe that the clause should be applied to all countries and all agreements, we also think that, in the case of countries covered by the new neighbourhood policy, one might consider signing agreements that go beyond the democracy clause, based on the sharing of common institutions for promoting democratic principles and human rights, on the example of the Council of Europe and regional agreements.", "lang": "IT", "original": "Vittorio Agnoletto (GUE/NGL), relatore . \u2013 Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, la clausola relativa ai diritti dell\u2019uomo e alla democrazia ha una lunga storia all\u2019interno del Parlamento e parte dal presupposto che i diritti civili e politici ma, intesi in senso lato, anche quelli economici, sociali e culturali, debbano essere al centro della politica dell\u2019Unione europea.\nLe clausola nasce nei primi anni \u201990 con l\u2019accordo di Lom\u00e9 e, proprio nel 1990, \u00e8 stata applicata anche all\u2019Argentina. Nella sua relazione annuale, il Parlamento europeo chiede ogni anno che questa clausola assuma un maggiore significato ed esorta il Consiglio a conferire al Parlamento un ruolo pi\u00f9 importante nella sorveglianza della sua applicazione. Finora, le richieste del Parlamento non hanno ottenuto risposte soddisfacenti. Attualmente la clausola \u00e8 inserita in pi\u00f9 di cinquanta accordi e viene applicata a oltre centoventi paesi. A tale proposito, va sottolineata l\u2019importanza dell\u2019Accordo di Cotonou, firmato con i paesi ACP nel giugno del 2000, che ha potenziato il ruolo di questa clausola.\nIl primo punto che vorrei affrontare riguarda il Parlamento europeo. Esso deve dare il proprio parere conforme a un accordo prima della sua entrata in vigore, ma non \u00e8 chiamato a pronunciarsi sull\u2019avvio di una consultazione o sulla parziale sospensione di un accordo. Ci\u00f2 sminuisce il suo ruolo istituzionale e, pi\u00f9 in generale, politico.\nPer tale motivo ritengo importante sottolineare che il Parlamento non \u00e8 pi\u00f9 disposto a dare il proprio parere conforme a nuovi accordi internazionali che non contengono una clausola relativa ai diritti dell\u2019uomo e alla democrazia. Il Parlamento ritiene di dover partecipare alla definizione del mandato negoziale relativo ai nuovi accordi con paesi terzi e, soprattutto, all\u2019elaborazione delle loro finalit\u00e0 politiche e di promozione dei diritti umani. Inoltre, il Parlamento chiede di essere coinvolto nel processo decisionale concernente l\u2019avvio di una consultazione o la sospensione di un accordo, o ancora la sospensione di eventuali misure adeguate negative che sono gi\u00e0 state imposte a un paese. Infine, il Parlamento chiede di essere associato al Consiglio di associazione e alle sottocommissioni sui diritti umani e auspica che le sue delegazioni interparlamentari svolgano un ruolo rafforzato al riguardo, iscrivendo regolarmente all\u2019ordine del giorno delle riunioni discussioni sulla clausola democratica.\nUn altro punto che vorrei affrontare riguarda la reciprocit\u00e0 tra l\u2019Unione europea e i paesi terzi, che finora non \u00e8 stata pienamente sfruttata. Ritengo inoltre che la clausola debba essere applicata in relazione alla violazione di cui si discute e non in relazione al paese di cui si discute.\nE\u2019 altres\u00ec necessario estendere la clausola a tutti i nuovi accordi tra l\u2019Unione europea e i paesi terzi \u2013 industrializzati o in via di sviluppo \u2013 includendo gli accordi settoriali e gli aiuti commerciali, tecnici o finanziari, sull\u2019esempio di quanto \u00e8 stato realizzato finora per i paesi ACP.\nE\u2019 necessario prevedere l\u2019iscrizione sistematica delle questioni attinenti ai diritti umani all\u2019ordine del giorno del Consiglio di associazione. A tale proposito, si ritiene che il capo delle delegazioni esterne della Commissione nei paesi terzi debba svolgere un ruolo pi\u00f9 importante e si chiede l\u2019elaborazione di documenti strategici pluriennali paese per paese, che devono essere discussi regolarmente.\nE\u2019 inoltre previsto un dialogo strutturato tra il Consiglio di associazione e la sua sottocommissione sui diritti umani. Si chiede l\u2019istituzione generalizzata delle sottocommissioni sui diritti umani, incaricate di verificare il rispetto, l\u2019applicazione e l\u2019implementazione della clausola democratica, nonch\u00e9 di proporre azioni specifiche positive, volte al miglioramento della democrazia e dei diritti umani. E\u2019 importante sottolineare che si chiede l\u2019inclusione e la consultazione in queste sottocommissioni dei rappresentanti dei parlamenti e delle organizzazioni della societ\u00e0 civile.\nVi \u00e8 poi un ulteriore aspetto estremamente importante. Con questa risoluzione noi riconosciamo che finora l\u2019applicazione della clausola \u00e8 stata resa pi\u00f9 difficile dal requisito dell\u2019unanimit\u00e0 in seno al Consiglio per l\u2019avvio di una procedura di consultazione. Si chiede pertanto l\u2019abolizione dell\u2019unanimit\u00e0 e, a tal fine, la revisione dell\u2019articolo 300, paragrafo 2, del Trattato che istituisce la Comunit\u00e0 europea, che limita il ruolo del Parlamento europeo in questi casi.\nInfine, se da un lato si ritiene che la clausola debba essere applicata a tutti i paesi e a tutti gli accordi, dall\u2019altro lato si ritiene che con i paesi interessati dalla nuova politica di vicinato si potrebbe prevedere la firma di accordi che vadano oltre la clausola democratica, basati sulla condivisione di istituzioni comuni per la promozione dei principi democratici e dei diritti umani, sull\u2019esempio del Consiglio d\u2019Europa e degli accordi regionali.", "agenda_item": "The Human Rights and Democracy Clause (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060214-ITEM-004", "intervention_id": "2-008", "summary_english": "{\n\"headline\": \"Call for Stronger Parliamentary Role and Systematic Application of the Human Rights and Democracy Clause in EU Agreements\",\n\"issueSum\": \"The speech addresses the longstanding human rights and democracy clause in EU agreements, highlighting problems with its implementation, Parliament's limited role in oversight, lack of reciprocity, the need for broader application to all EU external agreements, and procedural obstacles such as the Council's unanimity requirement.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"The speaker advocates for a more robust and proactive approach to the human rights and democracy clause, insisting on Parliament's increased involvement in all stages, the systematic extension of the clause to all EU agreements, more effective structures for monitoring compliance, and reforming decision-making processes that hinder action.\",\n\"argSum\": \"Arguments include the clause's foundational importance for EU values (civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights); the inadequacy of Parliament's current role which diminishes institutional and political authority; the need for a direct, issue-based application of the clause rather than a country-based approach; the necessity of regular and structured monitoring; and the inefficiency and obstacle created by the Council's unanimity rule.\",\n\"propSum\": \"Proposals include: 1) Parliament refusing assent to new agreements lacking a human rights and democracy clause; 2) Parliament's role in defining the negotiating mandate, objectives, and enforcing suspension or consultation; 3) Extension of the clause to all external agreements, including sectoral ones; 4) Systematic inclusion of human rights on Association Council agendas; 5) Creation of human rights subcommittees with civil society participation; 6) Drafting country-specific multiannual strategy documents; 7) Abolishing the Council's unanimity requirement and revising Article 300(2) EC Treaty; 8) Considering enhanced agreements with neighborhood countries, inspired by models like the Council of Europe.\",\n\"quotes\": [\n\"Parliament is no longer prepared to give its assent to new international agreements that do not contain a human rights and democracy clause\",\n\"Parliament maintains that it has to play a part in defining the negotiating mandate for new agreements with third countries and, above all, in drafting their political and human rights objectives\",\n\"We therefore call for the abolition of this unanimity requirement and, in that respect, for the revision of Article 300(2) of the EC Treaty, which limits the role of the European Parliament in such cases\"\n]\n}", "summary_original": "{\n  \"headline\": \"Strengthening the EU Human Rights and Democracy Clause in International Agreements\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"The speech addresses the effectiveness, scope, and institutional role regarding the Human Rights and Democracy Clause in EU international agreements.

The user provided a debate summary about the Human Rights and Democracy Clause (HRDC) in EU external agreements and wants the main points from Vittorio Agnoletto's contributions.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the debate summary to find any mentions of Vittorio Agnoletto. The Executive Summary's \"Patterns and Key Issues\" section mentions him in the context of widespread support for strengthening the HRDC. Specifically, under point 2, it says: \"Parliament maintains that it has to play a part in defining the negotiating mandate... [Agnoletto].\" Also, in the \"Actionable Proposals,\" there's a mention of Agnoletto's quote: \"Parliament is no longer prepared to give its assent to new international agreements that do not contain a human rights and democracy clause.\"\n\nSo, the key points from Agnoletto are his call for Parliament's role in defining negotiating mandates and his stance on refusing assent to agreements without the HRDC. The issue is the need for stronger HRDC enforcement. His position is about Parliament's involvement and conditional assent. The argument is that without the HRDC, agreements shouldn't be approved. The proposal is to refuse assent to such agreements.\n\nI need to structure this into the JSON format as specified. Make sure not to include other speakers' points. Check if there are other mentions.

Mr President, I welcome this report on the human rights and democracy clause in European Union agreements prepared by the honourable Members of this House, and especially by Mr Agnoletto, and the resolution before Parliament today.\nHuman rights clauses have been inserted systematically into external agreements since 1995 and, ten years on, it is timely to take stock of what has been achieved. All EU institutions need to work together to this end, and I emphasise my commitment to an ongoing, but also very practical, dialogue with the Council and Parliament, for which this report provides a good basis.\nI shall begin by underlining how much has already been achieved: it must be said that the glass is more than half full. After often difficult discussions and very difficult negotiations, the Commission has secured the inclusion of a human rights and democracy clause in, as you said, more than 50 agreements, covering over 120 countries. A notable example is, indeed, that of Articles 9 and 96 of the Cotonou Agreement. In the field of trade policy, the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance, known as \u2018GSP+\u2019, provides additional benefits for countries that implement, inter alia , certain international standards in human and social rights; so it is a positive incentive.\nThe impact of human rights clauses is already evident, and many of our human rights activities are supported by their mere existence. Human rights feature prominently in every political dialogue with our partners. Human rights subcommittees are being established with a growing number of partners, and, indeed, the European Union Neighbourhood Policy Action Plans contain highly detailed sections on human rights.\nThe Commission, as part of the troika, makes numerous d\u00e9marches on human rights issues every year, and the European Initiative on Democracy and Human Rights funds human rights projects throughout the world. The Commission is also funding numerous technical assistance projects with an impact on human rights, ranging from, for instance, improving police training to modernising the judicial system in partner countries. The rule of law is one of the most important areas where I think we can really make a difference.\nI would also like to mention how active both Member State embassies and Commission delegations are in this regard. EU Heads of Mission collectively draw up human rights fact sheets periodically, report on the implementation of the various EU human rights guidelines and make detailed analyses of developments in particular countries concerning human rights and democracy. More and more frequently, political reporting from the Commission delegations is covering human rights issues.\nAssessing the effectiveness of the human rights clause to date needs to be done in a comprehensive manner. The human rights and democracy clause is, in itself, an important way of demonstrating the shared commitment of the European Union and its partners to upholding, and also to promoting, human rights. The human rights clause opens the door to developing a deeper and more intensive dialogue on human rights issues. Moreover, the existence of these clauses may, in some cases, even help deter potential human rights violations.\nAs far as sanctions are concerned, I would like to underline that the frequency of imposition clearly depends less on the wording of the human rights clause than on the political will of the Member States, as well as of the other states. I agree that, when sanctions are not implemented in response to serious breaches of human rights, the credibility of the EU\u2019s human rights policy could be damaged.\nFor its part, the Commission would sometimes like to see a more robust use of these clauses but the solution is not, however, to include more clauses in the agreement. Instead, we need to build up awareness and the consensus throughout the European Union on the importance of human rights issues relative to other priorities. This report therefore makes a valuable contribution in this regard.\nAs regards Parliament\u2019s involvement in negotiating or suspending an agreement, you will be well aware that these procedures are clearly established by the Treaty and reflect the interinstitutional structure of the European Union. Parliament already plays an invaluable role in focusing attention on human rights issues, through the extremely active work of the Subcommittee on Human Rights, through its annual report on human rights in the world and through the many resolutions and debates on particular human rights issues. Moreover, I very much welcome the suggestion that interparliamentary delegations should take up human rights issues much more systematically. I think that there, too, you have a great role to play.\nI also favour revising the format of the current EU Annual Report on Human Rights in order to make it a fully interinstitutional report and to include an analysis of the application of human rights clauses.\nIn conclusion, let me reiterate that the success of human rights clauses should be measured by the progress made in engaging partners in a genuine dialogue and in consultations on human rights, and the resulting improvements in human rights.\nOver the last ten years, human rights clauses have provided an indispensable foundation for developing a truly effective human rights dialogue with our partners because it is in this way that these countries slowly change their behaviour. That does not mean, of course, that there is no room for improvement: there is always room for improvement, and I look forward to this debate today and to an ongoing and active debate with Parliament.

The next paragraph under \"Parliamentary Involvement & Oversight\" mentions Agnoletto, Ford, Dimitrakopoulos, Joan i Mar\u00ed, but not Fern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00edn. \n\nLooking further, in the \"Actionable Proposals\" section, there's a mention of \"Fern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00edn\" in the quote: \"Human rights are universal and indivisible and that human rights, democracy and development are highly interdependent\" [Fern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00edn]. \n\nSo the key points from Fern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00edn are his support for the HRDC, emphasizing the universality and indivisibility of human rights, and their interdependence with democracy and development. \n\nNow, structuring the JSON response. The issueSum should mention the HRDC and its importance. PositionSum would state his support for the clause and the need for it to be universal.

This would change significantly the institutional framework within which these agreements are concluded.\nMr Agnoletto is right to recommend the extension of the human rights clause to all sectors and to all countries and the precedent which he uses to support this opinion is interesting. Mr Agnoletto is right to call for better control and a better monitoring procedure to establish if the parties are adhering to what they have signed, because often, as you all know, signature is easy, but adherence is hard. Mr Agnoletto is right to mention the need for a mechanism on the application of agreements, among other things. He is right to insist that the human rights dimension should be highly visible in this mechanism. Finally, he is right in his final conclusion that the time has come, at long last, for us to look at a new clause with a content which reflects everything we are debating and everything that we commend on many occasions or that, on other occasions, we criticise through the European process.\nThe Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has, as you know, tabled an amendment which, as far as I understand, Mr Agnoletto accepts and, consequently, it supports his report.", "lang": "EL", "original": "\u0393\u03b9\u03ce\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 \u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03b7\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2, \u03b5\u03be \u03bf\u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u039f\u03bc\u03ac\u03b4\u03b1\u03c2 PPE-DE . \u2013 \u039a\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03b5 \u03a0\u03c1\u03cc\u03b5\u03b4\u03c1\u03b5, \u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 \u0395\u03c0\u03af\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03b5, \u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03af\u03b5\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9 \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03ac\u03b4\u03b5\u03bb\u03c6\u03bf\u03b9, \u03b8\u03ad\u03bb\u03c9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u2019 \u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03ac\u03c2 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c3\u03c5\u03b3\u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03ce \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03b5\u03b9\u03c3\u03b7\u03b3\u03b7\u03c4\u03ae, \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03ba.

The user provided a detailed debate summary about the Human Rights and Democracy Clause (HRDC) in EU external agreements. The task is to outline the main points or arguments made by Giorgos Dimitrakopoulos, but only the ones attributed to him. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the debate summary to find any mentions of Giorgos Dimitrakopoulos. The user mentioned that the response should not include contributions from other speakers, so I have to be careful.\n\nLooking at the \"Patterns and Key Issues\" section, under point 2, there's a mention of \"Giorgos Dimitrakopoulos\" in the context of parliamentary involvement and oversight. The exact quote is: \"Parliament maintains that it has to play a part in defining the negotiating mandate for new agreements with third countries and, above all, in drafting their political and human rights objectives\" [Agnoletto]. Wait, that's attributed to Agnoletto, not Dimitrakopoulos. Hmm, maybe I need to check again.\n\nWait, the user's example response includes a speaker's name, but in the provided debate summary, under the \"Patterns and Key Issues\" section, let me check each point again. \n\nLooking at the \"Executive Summary\" section, under \"Patterns and Key Issues\", point 2: \"Parliamentary Involvement & Oversight\" mentions \"e.g., Agnoletto, Ford, Dimitrakopoulos, Joan i Mar\u00ed\". So Dimitrakopoulos is listed as one of the speakers who called for Parliament's role. However, the specific quotes attributed to him aren't provided in the summary. The summary mentions that \"Parliament maintains that it has to play a part...\" but that's attributed to Agnoletto. \n\nWait, maybe there's a mistake here. The user's query says that the speaker is Giorgos Dimitrakopoulos, but in the provided debate summary, the only direct quote from Dimitrakopoulos isn't present. The summary lists him as part of the group that called for Parliament's role, but there's no specific statement from him. \n\nIn that case, according to the user's instructions, if there are no points or arguments attributed to the speaker, the response should be an empty string. However, the user's example response includes a speaker with some points. But in this case, the debate summary doesn't have any specific contributions from Giorgos Dimitrakopoulos beyond being mentioned as part of a group. \n\nTherefore, since there's no specific argument or contribution from Dimitrakopoulos detailed in the summary, the correct response would be an empty JSON object. But I need to confirm that there's no other mention. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the entire debate summary, under \"Notable Quotes\", there's a quote from \"Fern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00edn\" and others, but no mention of Giorgos Dimitrakopoulos. The only place he's mentioned is in the list of speakers in the \"Parliamentary Involvement & Oversight\" section, but without a direct quote. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be that there are no points attributed to him, so the JSON should be empty.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"\",\n\"positionSum\": \"\",\n\"argSum\": \"\",\n\"propSum\": \"\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "gpt-4.1", "generator_model_type": "gpt", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "gpt"}, {"speaker": "Mar\u00eda Elena Valenciano Mart\u00ednez-Orozco,", "english": "Mar\u00eda Elena Valenciano Mart\u00ednez-Orozco, on behalf of the PSE Group . \u2013 (ES) Mr President, respect for democratic principles and fundamental human rights, as stated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, inspires the internal and external policies of the parties and constitutes an essential element of the European Union\u2019s international agreements.\nThe cumbersome and vague wording of the democratic clause to which I have just referred has many limitations and lacks the mechanisms required to ensure that it functions properly.

For this, we need Europe to have a genuine commitment to human rights; an effective, credible and coherent commitment.\nWe can implement a warning system to identify human rights violations which allows us to act appropriately and react in time. Europe must maintain reciprocity in the application of the human rights clause, because we must be able to maintain a frank and open dialogue with the countries with which we have reached agreements, and we must also be able to listen to the criticisms of partner countries, in relation to how we Europeans treat their nationals, for example, and react accordingly.\nEurope must maintain a credible position. Human rights cannot be used as a bargaining chip. We cannot stop defending them for the sake of other topical interests. Europe must act in an honest and clear fashion.

The user provided a detailed debate summary about the Human Rights and Democracy Clause (HRDC) in EU external agreements. The task is to extract the main points made by Mar\u00eda Elena Valenciano Mart\u00ednez-Orozco, a specific speaker mentioned in the summary.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the debate summary to find any mentions of this speaker. Scanning through the sections, under the \"Patterns and Key Issues\" section, there's a mention of her in point 1. The quote says: \"The current HRDC is 'cumbersome and vague...lacks the mechanisms required to ensure that it functions properly' [Valenciano Mart\u00ednez-Orozco].\" \n\nSo her main point here is critical of the current HRDC's wording and effectiveness. She points out that it's too vague and doesn't have proper mechanisms. The issue she raises is about the HRDC's lack of enforceability and clarity. \n\nLooking at the \"Actionable Proposals\" section, there's a proposal for systematic inclusion and legally-binding HRDC. But since the user wants only the points from the specific speaker, I need to stick to her quotes. \n\nIn the \"Notable Quotes\" section, there's another mention of her: \"The cumbersome and vague wording of the democratic clause...lacks the mechanisms required to ensure that it functions properly\" [Valenciano Mart\u00ednez-Orozco]. This reinforces her argument about the clause's shortcomings.\n\nSo, the issue she raised is the HRDC's ineffective wording and lack of mechanisms. Her position is that the clause isn't working as intended. The argument is that the current structure doesn't have the necessary tools for enforcement. There's no specific proposal mentioned from her in the summary, just the critique. \n\nI need to structure this into the JSON fields. The \"issueSum\" would be about the HRDC's effectiveness. \"positionSum\" is her criticism of the current clause. \"argSum\" is the reasoning behind her position, which is the lack of mechanisms. \"propSum\" might be empty since she didn't propose a specific action, just pointed out the problem. \n\nWait, but the user said if there are no points, return an empty string. So I need to check if she made any proposals. The summary doesn't mention her suggesting specific reforms, just highlighting the problem. So propSum would be an empty string. \n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should reflect her critique of the HRDC's wording and mechanisms without including other speakers' points.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The effectiveness and structure of the Human Rights and Democracy Clause (HRDC) in EU external agreements, particularly its vague wording and lack of enforceable mechanisms.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"The current HRDC is insufficiently structured and lacks the necessary mechanisms to ensure its proper functionality.\",\n\"argSum\": \"The speaker criticizes the HRDC for being 'cumbersome and vague' and highlights the absence of mechanisms to enforce its provisions effectively.\",\n\"propSum\": \"\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "gpt-4.1", "generator_model_type": "gpt", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "gpt"}, {"speaker": "Sajjad Karim,", "english": "Sajjad Karim, on behalf of the ALDE Group . \u2013 Mr President, in May 1995 the Council decided that, to promote fundamental rights and the EU\u2019s democratic ideals, a clause insisting upon human rights observation should be included as an essential element of all bilateral agreements.\nIn the ten years since the clause was introduced it has stood up to rigorous examination by the European Court of Justice and has been introduced into more than 50 of the EU\u2019s agreements.

Looking through the sections, under the \"Patterns and Key Issues\" part, there's a section titled \"3. Uniformity, Reciprocity, and Consistency\" which mentions Sajjad Karim. The quote attributed to him is: \"When dealing with key countries, strategic partnerships and double standards of Realpolitik still eclipse the fundamental human rights which this clause seeks to protect.\"\n\nSo, the key issue here is the EU's double standards in applying the HRDC, especially with major trade partners. His position is that the EU is inconsistent, prioritizing strategic interests over human rights. The argument is that this selectivity undermines the clause's effectiveness. However, the summary doesn't mention any specific proposals from Karim, only his criticism of double standards.\n\nNow, structuring the JSON response. The issueSum should capture the problem of double standards. The positionSum would state his view on the EU's selective application.

Mr\u00a0Agnoletto's report puts forward some important proposals that, as you can see, have garnered extremely broad consensus here in Parliament. This clause does suffer from some deficiencies. First of all, there is a lack of uniformity: the wording of the clause may vary from one type of agreement to another. I, and the rapporteur, would advocate a better clause, in order to increase its political and legal impact. It must, for example, be clearly established that the parties to these agreements are required to comply with the international standards and obligations incumbent on them.\nSecondly, in most cases, as has already been stressed, this clause suffers from a lack of concrete enforcement methods. In order to be consistent, the European Union must establish such methods. We cannot expect to retain our credibility in the eyes of our partners if, on the one hand, we claim to want respect for human rights to be an essential part of our policy but, on the other, we do not take the necessary measures if these countries systematically violate those rights. At the moment, the ACP agreements probably form the most advanced model, which should be our inspiration.\nThe mechanisms for enforcing the clause must also be graduated. We must not see them just as reprimands for human rights violations, but also as ways of helping to strengthen human rights in third countries. That is why the positive approach of the human rights clause is so important.\nWith regard to Parliament's role, in order to guarantee that our policy is consistent, credible and transparent, it is absolutely vital for us to be involved at all the stages of enforcing the clause. When Parliament's resolutions refer to the clause, or call for appropriate measures to be taken, the Council should take heed of these calls and assess whether they are appropriate.\nThe second vital point is the link between the clause and the structures for political dialogue. The link between this clause and the creation of 'human rights' subcommittees must be clear, and these committees should also be strengthened. I also find it regrettable in this connection that the European Union's requirements have been relaxed, particularly for certain of our neighbours. If we want to implement this clause effectively, we must create the forums needed for a frank and constructive exchange of views on human rights.\nWith regard to the reciprocity principle, this dialogue must also be reciprocal, particularly at a time when some of our Member States are having fingers pointed at them because of their anti-terrorism policy, for example, or because of inhumane prison conditions. We must be able to listen to any criticisms our partners may make.\nFinally, it is important that human rights must not be a matter just for our ministers of foreign affairs, but for all government bodies. That is why I, like the rapporteur, am advocating that the clause be an 'essential element' in all agreements and, finally, that Parliament should no longer give its assent to new agreements that do not contain a human rights and democracy clause.", "lang": "FR", "original": "H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Flautre, au nom du groupe Verts/ALE . - Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, la clause dont nous discutons aujourd\u2019hui constitue le fondement et la l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 de l\u2019action de l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne aupr\u00e8s des \u00c9tats tiers en mati\u00e8re de respect des droits de l\u2019homme. Le rapport de M.\u00a0Agnoletto avance des propositions importantes et, comme vous le voyez, extr\u00eamement consensuelles dans ce Parlement. Cette clause souffre de lacunes. Il y a d\u2019abord un manque d\u2019uniformit\u00e9. La formulation de cette clause peut varier d\u2019un type d\u2019accord \u00e0 un autre. Je plaide ici, avec le rapporteur, pour une clause am\u00e9lior\u00e9e afin d\u2019en renforcer la port\u00e9e politique et \u00e9galement juridique. Il doit, par exemple, \u00eatre clairement \u00e9tabli que les parties \u00e0 ces accords sont tenues de se conformer aux normes internationales et aux obligations qui en d\u00e9coulent.\nDeuxi\u00e8mement, dans la majorit\u00e9 des cas, comme il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9, cette clause souffre d\u2019une absence de modalit\u00e9s et d\u2019applications concr\u00e8tes.

Nous ne pouvons pas esp\u00e9rer rester cr\u00e9dibles face \u00e0 nos partenaires si, d\u2019une part, nous pr\u00e9tendons vouloir faire du respect des droits de l\u2019homme un \u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel de notre politique mais que, d\u2019autre part, nous ne prenons pas les mesures n\u00e9cessaires lorsque ces pays violent syst\u00e9matiquement ces m\u00eames droits. Actuellement, les accords ACP sont probablement les accords qui en fournissent le mod\u00e8le le plus avanc\u00e9, il s\u2019agit donc de nous en inspirer.\nLes m\u00e9canismes de mise en \u0153uvre de la clause doivent \u00e9galement \u00eatre gradu\u00e9s. Nous ne pouvons pas seulement les envisager comme des outils de r\u00e9primande en cas de violation des droits de l\u2019homme, mais \u00e9galement comme des moyens de contribuer au renforcement des droits de l\u2019homme dans les \u00c9tats tiers. C\u2019est l\u00e0 toute l\u2019importance de l\u2019approche positive de la clause relative aux droits de l\u2019homme.\nConcernant le r\u00f4le du Parlement, dans le but de garantir la coh\u00e9rence, la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et la transparence de notre politique, il est primordial que le Parlement soit associ\u00e9 aux diff\u00e9rentes \u00e9tapes de mise en \u0153uvre de la clause. Lorsque, dans ses r\u00e9solutions, le Parlement \u00e9voque la clause, demande la mise en \u0153uvre de mesures appropri\u00e9es, le Conseil devrait donner suite \u00e0 cette demande et en examiner l\u2019opportunit\u00e9.\nDeuxi\u00e8me point essentiel, le lien entre la clause et les structures du dialogue politique. Le lien doit \u00eatre clair entre cette clause et la cr\u00e9ation de sous-comit\u00e9s \u00abdroits de l\u2019homme\u00bb, qu\u2019il convient \u00e9galement de renforcer. Je regrette d\u2019ailleurs \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard la r\u00e9vision \u00e0 la baisse des exigences de l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne, notamment avec certains \u00c9tats voisins. Si nous esp\u00e9rons mettre efficacement cette clause en \u0153uvre, nous devons cr\u00e9er les espaces n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 un \u00e9change franc et constructif sur les droits de l\u2019homme.\nConcernant le principe de r\u00e9ciprocit\u00e9, ce dialogue doit \u00eatre \u00e9galement r\u00e9ciproque au moment m\u00eame o\u00f9 un certain nombre d\u2019\u00c9tats membres sont point\u00e9s du doigt du fait de leur politique en mati\u00e8re de lutte contre le terrorisme, par exemple, ou encore de la situation inhumaine dans les prisons. Nous devons pouvoir \u00e9couter les critiques que pourraient formuler nos partenaires.\nEnfin et derni\u00e8rement, il est important que les droits de l\u2019homme ne soient pas une pr\u00e9occupation pour nos seuls ministres des affaires \u00e9trang\u00e8res mais la pr\u00e9occupation de toutes les instances gouvernementales. Pour cette raison, je plaide, comme le rapporteur, pour une clause de \u00abl\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel\u00bb dans tous les accords et pour que, et j\u2019en termine, le Parlement ne donne plus son avis conforme \u00e0 de nouveaux accords qui ne contiendraient pas une clause relative aux droits de l\u2019homme et \u00e0 la d\u00e9mocratie.", "agenda_item": "The Human Rights and Democracy Clause (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060214-ITEM-004", "intervention_id": "2-015", "summary_english": "{\n  \"headline\": \"Calls for Strengthening and Uniform Enforcement of the EU Human Rights and Democracy Clause\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"The speech addresses deficiencies in the current Human Rights and Democracy Clause within EU agreements with third countries.

The user provided a detailed debate summary about the Human Rights and Democracy Clause (HRDC) in EU agreements and wants the main points from H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Flautre's speech.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the debate summary to find any mentions of H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Flautre. Scanning through the sections, I see she's mentioned in the \"Notable Quotes\" section. The quote there is: \"The European Union must establish such methods. We cannot expect to retain our credibility...if we do not take the necessary measures if these countries systematically violate those rights\" [Flautre].\n\nNow, the task is to extract her arguments, positions, issues, and proposals. The user specified that only her contributions should be included, and others' shouldn't. The example response structure is JSON with four fields: issueSum, positionSum, argSum, propSum.\n\nLooking at the quote, Flautre emphasizes the need for the EU to take necessary measures against countries violating rights to maintain credibility. So, the issue is about the EU's credibility and enforcement of HRDC. Her position is that the EU must establish methods to enforce the clause. The argument is tied to retaining credibility. There's no explicit proposal mentioned beyond establishing methods, which might be part of the propSum.\n\nBut wait, the debate summary also mentions her in the patterns section. Let me check again. In the \"Patterns and Key Issues\" section under point 2, there's a mention of Flautre in the quote: \"The European Union must establish such methods. We cannot expect to retain our credibility...if we do not take the necessary measures if these countries systematically violate those rights\" [Flautre].\n\nSo, her main point is about the necessity of taking measures against violations to maintain credibility. The issue is the EU's credibility and enforcement mechanisms. Her position is that the EU must establish methods (like enforcement mechanisms). The argument is that without taking measures, credibility is lost. The proposal would be establishing these methods, which could be part of propSum.\n\nBut the user's example response for propSum is a specific action. However, in the quote, it's more about the need to take measures rather than a specific proposal. So maybe propSum is \"establish methods to take necessary measures against systematic human rights violations to retain credibility.\"\n\nBut the user's instruction says to outline the main points or arguments made by the speaker. Since the quote is about the necessity of taking measures, the issue is the EU's credibility, position is that measures are necessary, argument is to retain credibility, and the proposal is to establish methods.\n\nI need to structure this into the four JSON fields. Let me make sure there's no other info about her in the debate summary. The rest of the summary mentions other speakers, but Flautre's quote is only in the notable quotes. So the answer should be based on that single quote.\n\nTherefore, the JSON would be:\n\nissueSum: \"The key issue raised by the speaker relates to the EU's credibility and the need for effective enforcement mechanisms against systematic human rights violations by third countries.\"\npositionSum: \"She emphasizes that the EU must establish methods to take necessary measures against countries that systematically violate human rights to retain its credibility.\"\nargSum: \"Her argument is that without taking such measures, the EU cannot maintain its credibility in international relations.\"\npropSum: \"She proposes establishing methods to enforce the HRDC and take necessary actions against violators.\"\n\nBut I need to check if the propSum is mentioned. The quote says \"must establish such methods\" which is a proposal. So propSum would be about establishing methods. However, the user's example has propSum as a specific action. So I need to phrase it accordingly.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The key issue raised by the speaker relates to the EU's credibility and the need for effective enforcement mechanisms against systematic human rights violations by third countries.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"She emphasizes that the EU must establish methods to take necessary measures against countries that systematically violate human rights to retain its credibility.\",\n\"argSum\": \"Her argument is that without taking such measures, the EU cannot maintain its credibility in international relations.\",\n\"propSum\": \"She proposes establishing methods to enforce the HRDC and take necessary actions against violators.\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "gpt-4.1", "generator_model_type": "gpt", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "gpt"}, {"speaker": "Ji\u0159\u00ed Ma\u0161t\u00e1lka,", "english": "Ji\u0159\u00ed Ma\u0161t\u00e1lka, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group . \u2013 ( CS ) Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on an outstanding piece of work.

He suggests that the EU should focus on addressing its own internal democratic deficits instead of imposing standards externally.", "propSum": "He proposes that the EU should encourage democracy and human rights by example and friendship, rather than imposing rigid, universal conditions that are unlikely to be met and could be seen as intrusive.", "quotes": ["Are we really saying that we are going to turn the tide of history by telling China to turn into a democratic country with full human rights overnight, just on the basis of one report from the European Parliament I think not", "I was also struck by the arrogance of the Commissioner in demanding that other countries, such as China and Japan, abolish the death penalty if they want to have relations with the EU", "Perhaps the European Union should put its own House in order first, as far as democracy is concerned"]}, "reconstructed_position": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a detailed debate summary about the Human Rights and Democracy Clause (HRDC) in EU external agreements. The task is to outline the main points or arguments made by Gerard Batten, but according to the debate summary, his contributions are mentioned in the \"Challenges and Reservations\" section.\n\nFirst, I need to check the debate summary's \"Challenges and Reservations\" part. It says that Gerard Batten and Bruno Gollnisch raised concerns about the practicality and fairness of universal application of the HRDC. Batten's specific quote is: \"Perhaps the European Union should put its own House in order first, as far as democracy is concerned.\" Additionally, Gollnisch's quote is similar: \"Before we go looking for the speck in our neighbour's eye, should we not remove the plank from our own?\" \n\nSo, the key points here are Batten's argument that the EU should focus on its own democratic issues before enforcing HRDC on others. The issue he raises is about the EU's internal democracy and the potential hypocrisy of imposing standards on others while not meeting them itself. His position is skeptical about the HRDC's universal application, suggesting that the EU needs to address its own problems first. The argument here is that the EU's credibility is at stake if it doesn't uphold democratic values internally. However, the user's instruction says to only include points attributed to the speaker in question. \n\nLooking at the example response provided, the structure is clear. The issueSum should capture the main issue he raised, positionSum his stance, argSum the reasoning, and propSum any proposals. But in the debate summary, Batten didn't propose specific policies, just raised a concern. So, the \"propSum\" might be empty. However, the example includes a propSum even if it's a call to action. \n\nWait, the user's instruction says that if there are no points, respond with an empty string. So I need to check if Batten made any arguments. The summary mentions he raised concerns about practicality and fairness, and his quote about the EU's own house. So the issue is the EU's internal democracy versus external enforcement. His position is that the EU should fix its own issues first. The argument is based on the idea of hypocrisy and the need for self-improvement before enforcing standards on others. There's no specific proposal mentioned, just a critique. \n\nTherefore, the JSON should have issueSum about the EU's internal democracy, positionSum about his skepticism towards universal application, argSum about the need to address internal issues first, and propSum as empty. But the example response includes a propSum even if it's a call for action. However, in the debate summary, Batten's contribution is a critique, not a proposal. So propSum would be an empty string. \n\nI need to structure the JSON accordingly, making sure not to include other speakers' points. The user's example shows that even if there's no proposal, it's an empty string. So the final answer should reflect that.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The speaker raised concerns about the practicality and fairness of applying the HRDC universally, emphasizing the need for the EU to address its own democratic shortcomings before enforcing standards on others.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"He expressed skepticism about the HRDC's universal application, arguing that the EU should prioritize internal democratic reforms before imposing external conditions.\",\n\"argSum\": \"His argument is based on the idea that the EU's credibility and consistency in promoting human rights and democracy depend on addressing its own internal democratic issues first.\",\n\"propSum\": \"\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "gpt-4.1", "generator_model_type": "gpt", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "gpt"}, {"speaker": "Ryszard Czarnecki (NI). \u2013", "english": "Ryszard Czarnecki (NI). \u2013 (PL) Mr\u00a0President, if our successors attempt to assess the principal values and advantages of the European Union in a hundred years\u2019 time, they will note that one of the main reasons why the Union came into being was to defend and promote human rights the world over. We should be flying the flag for human rights at all times and not lowering it in unfavourable circumstances, as unfortunately sometimes happens.\nI am concerned about our notorious double standards. We are quite prepared to demand that human rights be respected and to condemn certain countries that fail to do so. However, when it comes to the largest countries or countries that are particularly important in economic terms for businesses in the Member States of the Union, we are just as prepared to remain silent on the subject of human rights or we speak about them in whispers. The curse of these double standards is a stain on the Union\u2019s honour. It is a stain on our fine blue flag with its gold stars.\nHuman rights must also be understood in an economic context. That is why we support the granting of debt relief to developing countries, as Mr\u00a0Martin mentioned. However, we are also in favour of monitoring the implementation of Union aid to ensure it is not used to prop up dictatorships in Africa and Asia.\nI believe it is worth emphasising the need to include clauses on human rights and democracy in the sectoral agreements we enter into concerning agriculture, fisheries and textiles for example.

An important precedent was set in Uzbekistan following the Andijan massacre, but the fact that the reaction took four months is a sad commentary on the lack of seriousness given to the clauses in the past.\nDespite huge human rights concerns and EU influence in the Middle East, human rights clauses have never been invoked in relations with Egypt, Israel or Tunisia, in the latter case despite strong EU statements last year on curbs on freedom of expression and the blocking of NGO funding.\nWith the ACP countries, I acknowledge that so-called Article\u00a096 consultations have taken place with 15 countries over the last eight years, in 11 cases leading to appropriate measures. However, the EU maintains close relations with Angola, Ethiopia and Rwanda despite condemning abuses there and without any real pressure or action to follow up those condemnations. In Eritrea there has been little response to the d\u00e9marche so far: forced military conscription, arbitrary detention, harassment of refugees and the use of torture continue.\nHow do we ensure the success of consultations on the human rights clauses? It needs commitment on the side of the third country. Too much today this seems dependent on how far there is dependence on EU funding. It needs coordination between donors, for example as took place after the coup in the Central African Republic in 2003. It needs identification of the violations and the steps that need to be taken to rectify them, as in the case of Guinea-Bissau, when free and fair elections were held within the timescale set; and it needs the maintenance of close political dialogue, something that can be blocked and \u2013 as was seen today \u2013 was sadly lacking in the case of Iran.\nWe agree with the Commissioner that political reasons too often block action by Member States. I do not think she is arrogant; I think she is noble when she upholds the EU\u2019s unswerving commitment to ending the death penalty.

An important precedent was set in Uzbekistan following the Andijan massacre, but the fact that the reaction took four months is a sad commentary on the lack of seriousness given to the clauses in the past.\nDespite huge human rights concerns and EU influence in the Middle East, human rights clauses have never been invoked in relations with Egypt, Israel or Tunisia, in the latter case despite strong EU statements last year on curbs on freedom of expression and the blocking of NGO funding.\nWith the ACP countries, I acknowledge that so-called Article\u00a096 consultations have taken place with 15 countries over the last eight years, in 11 cases leading to appropriate measures. However, the EU maintains close relations with Angola, Ethiopia and Rwanda despite condemning abuses there and without any real pressure or action to follow up those condemnations. In Eritrea there has been little response to the d\u00e9marche so far: forced military conscription, arbitrary detention, harassment of refugees and the use of torture continue.\nHow do we ensure the success of consultations on the human rights clauses? It needs commitment on the side of the third country. Too much today this seems dependent on how far there is dependence on EU funding. It needs coordination between donors, for example as took place after the coup in the Central African Republic in 2003. It needs identification of the violations and the steps that need to be taken to rectify them, as in the case of Guinea-Bissau, when free and fair elections were held within the timescale set; and it needs the maintenance of close political dialogue, something that can be blocked and \u2013 as was seen today \u2013 was sadly lacking in the case of Iran.\nWe agree with the Commissioner that political reasons too often block action by Member States. I do not think she is arrogant; I think she is noble when she upholds the EU\u2019s unswerving commitment to ending the death penalty. I find it breathtaking that the UK Independence Party this morning said that we could turn a blind eye to human rights violations with China simply because we trade effectively with it.

It is true that what is known as the human rights and democracy clause has been incorporated into more than 50 agreements and that this affects 120 countries, but it is also the case that the degree to which it is complied with or the degree to which we demand that it be complied with varies considerably.\nAfter ten years of applying this system, therefore, we must take stock and take certain corrective measures, and I would therefore congratulate Mr Agnoletto on his work, on his report and on his conclusions, with which we agree, naturally.\nFirstly, I would like to stress that we must remember that many agreements with developed countries and sectoral agreements, such as those relating to textile products, agriculture and fisheries, do not yet contain such a clause, and that is clearly a deficiency.\nSecondly, although the clause applies both to the European Union and to the third country, full use has not yet been made of its reciprocal dimension and, as Mrs Valenciano Mart\u00ednez-Orozco has said, I believe that the European Union must begin by offering an example.\nThirdly, one of the factors that have compromised its application is the generic nature of its wording, since it does not provide for precise methods for positive or negative intervention in cooperation between the European Union and third countries, leading to the Council\u2019s demands and the national demands of the Member States taking precedence over more general human rights demands.\nFor all of these reasons, we support the drawing up of a new text for a model clause to improve the current wording of the so-called Article 2, with a view to guaranteeing a more coherent, effective and transparent approach to European human rights policy in the agreements with third countries.\n(Applause)", "lang": "ES", "original": "Ra\u00fcl Romeva i Rueda (Verts/ALE). \u2013 (ES) Se\u00f1or Presidente, me satisface realmente el alto grado de consenso que hay en esta C\u00e1mara en cuanto al hecho de que el desarrollo y la consolidaci\u00f3n de la democracia y del Estado de Derecho, as\u00ed como el respeto de los derechos humanos y de las libertades fundamentales, son \u2014aunque deben serlo m\u00e1s\u2014 un objetivo global de la pol\u00edtica exterior y de seguridad com\u00fan, y deben ser parte integrante de la pol\u00edtica exterior de la Uni\u00f3n Europea.\nY digo que deben serlo m\u00e1s porque, como se ha dicho, son numerosos, demasiados, los ejemplos en que estos principios quedan matizados, cuando no anulados, en favor de determinados intereses econ\u00f3micos, comerciales o pol\u00edticos particulares.

The user provided a detailed debate summary about the Human Rights and Democracy Clause (HRDC) in EU external agreements. They want me to focus on Bruno Gollnisch (NI) and outline his main points based on the summary.\n\nFirst, I need to scan through the debate summary to find any mentions of Bruno Gollnisch. The user mentioned that contributions from other speakers shouldn't be included, only those attributed to Gollnisch. \n\nLooking at the \"Challenges and Reservations\" section, there's a mention of Gerard Batten and Bruno Gollnisch. The quote says: \"Speakers like Gerard Batten and Bruno Gollnisch raised concerns about the practicality and fairness of universal application, cautioning against rigid imposition on economic giants or exporting internal disputes.\" Then there's a specific quote: \"Perhaps the European Union should put its own House in order first, as far as democracy is concerned\" [Batten]. Another quote: \"Before we go looking for the speck in our neighbour's eye, should we not remove the plank from our own?\" [Gollnisch]. \n\nSo Gollnisch's main points are about the EU needing to address its own democratic issues before enforcing HRDC on others. He's skeptical about the HRDC's relevance and possibly critical of NGOs' roles, as mentioned in the \"Challenges and Reservations\" section. However, the summary doesn't go into detail about his specific arguments beyond the quotes. \n\nThe user's example response includes issueSum, positionSum, argSum, propSum. I need to structure this based on the info from the debate summary. \n\nIssueSum: The key issue here is the EU's focus on external HRDC without addressing its own democratic shortcomings. \n\nPositionSum: His position is that the EU should prioritize its internal democratic issues before enforcing HRDC on others. He's skeptical about the HRDC's relevance and possibly about NGOs' roles, but the summary doesn't specify. \n\nArgSum: The argument is based on the idea that the EU must first ensure its own democracy before imposing standards on others. \n\nPropSum: The proposal isn't explicitly stated in the summary, but his argument implies a need for the EU to focus on internal reforms. However, the user's example includes propSum even if it's not explicitly stated. Wait, the user's instruction says if there are no points, respond with an empty string. But in this case, there's a quote from Gollnisch. \n\nBut the summary doesn't mention any specific proposals from him, just his concerns. So propSum might be empty. Let me check again. The debate summary says he raised concerns about practicality and fairness, cautioning against rigid imposition. The quotes are about the EU needing to fix its own house. So his position is that the EU should focus on its own democracy first. \n\nSo, the issue is the EU's internal democratic issues versus external enforcement. His position is skepticism towards HRDC's application, emphasizing internal reforms. The argument is based on the need for the EU to address its own problems before enforcing HRDC. There's no explicit proposal mentioned, just the critique. \n\nTherefore, the JSON should have issueSum, positionSum, argSum, and propSum. Since there's no specific proposal, propSum would be an empty string. But the user's example includes propSum even if it's a position. Wait, the example given by the user has \"He advocates strict limitations...\" as propSum. So maybe even if the proposal isn't explicit, but the position is a proposal. However, in this case, Gollnisch's position is more about criticism rather than a specific proposal. \n\nSo, the response would be:\n\nissueSum: The key issue raised by the speaker relates to the EU's focus on external human rights enforcement without addressing its own democratic shortcomings.\n\npositionSum: He expresses skepticism about the practicality and fairness of universal HRDC application, arguing that the EU should prioritize its own democratic reforms before imposing standards on others.\n\nargSum: His argument is based on the need for the EU to address its internal democratic issues before enforcing HRDC on third countries.\n\npropSum: \"\"\n\nBut I need to check if there's any mention of proposals. The summary says he raised concerns about practicality and fairness, but no specific proposals. So propSum is empty. \n\nTherefore, the JSON would have the three summaries with the above content.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The key issue raised by the speaker relates to the EU's focus on external human rights enforcement without addressing its own democratic shortcomings.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"He expresses skepticism about the practicality and fairness of universal HRDC application, arguing that the EU should prioritize its own democratic reforms before imposing standards on others.\",\n\"argSum\": \"His argument is based on the need for the EU to address its internal democratic issues before enforcing HRDC on third countries.\",\n\"propSum\": \"\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "gpt-4.1", "generator_model_type": "gpt", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "gpt"}, {"speaker": "Georgios Papastamkos (PPE-DE).", "english": "Georgios Papastamkos (PPE-DE). \u2013 (EL) Mr President, the democratic principle in the Union's foreign relations, which we are debating today in the wake of the report by Mr Agnoletto, whom I congratulate, raises a series of crucial questions. I shall confine myself, for reasons of time, to five of them.\nFirst question: will the Union continue to confine itself to the more or less declaratory character of the human rights and democracy clause or will it try \u2013 and this is my proposal \u2013 to raise the democracy principle to an appropriate legal means, into a sine qua non for the smooth functioning of agreements with third countries?\nSecond question: are the selective discounts of the democracy clause permissible? Is the differentiated intensity in the formulation of the principle in question permissible? The answer is obvious. The credibility of the invocation of democracy, the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms must obey the rule of uniform standards.\nThird question: do the elements of electoral competition and free elections alone suffice in order to characterise a system as democratic? Modern democratic life makes demands intertwined with the quality of democracy. It makes the demand of participatory civil rights, of horizontal political accountability. It makes the demand of honest governance, of institutional security and of social cohesion.\nFourth question: does the Union intend \u2013 do we the democratically legitimised Chamber par excellence intend \u2013 to adopt qualitative indicators for measuring and evaluating the democratic conduct of our private economic and commercial partners and, more importantly, of third European countries which are being called on, or will be called on, to satisfy the so-called Copenhagen criteria?\nFifth and last question: in European external relations, the democratic principle and the market economy are cited along side each other or in the same breath, but in practice the market economy claims priority.

The user provided a detailed debate summary about the Human Rights and Democracy Clause (HRDC) in EU external agreements. The task is to outline the main points of Georgios Papastamkos (PPE-DE) based on the summary. \n\nFirst, I need to scan through the debate summary to find any mentions of Papastamkos. The user mentioned that contributions from other speakers shouldn't be included, only those attributed to the specified speaker. \n\nLooking at the \"Notable Quotes\" section, there's a quote from Papastamkos: \"Modern democratic life makes demands intertwined with the quality of democracy.\" That's the only direct mention. Now, I need to see if there are any other references to him in the summary.\n\nIn the \"Patterns and Key Issues\" section, under point 4, there's a mention of \"Modern democratic life makes demands intertwined with the quality of democracy\" [Papastamkos]. So that's the key point. \n\nNow, structuring the JSON response. The user wants issueSum, positionSum, argSum, propSum. \n\nFor issueSum: The key issue here is the relationship between modern democratic life and the quality of democracy. The quote suggests that democratic quality is intertwined with modern life's demands.\n\nPositionSum: His position seems to emphasize that democracy's quality is linked to modern life's demands. He might be advocating for the HRDC to address these intertwined aspects.\n\nArgSum: The argument here is that the HRDC needs to consider how modern democratic life's demands affect democracy's quality. However, the summary doesn't provide explicit arguments beyond the quote. So maybe the argument is that the HRDC should account for these interdependencies.\n\nPropSum: The summary doesn't mention any specific proposals from Papastamkos. The quote is more about a statement than a proposal. So propSum might be empty.\n\nWait, the user said if there are no points, return an empty string. So I need to check if there's any other info. The debate summary's \"Actionable Proposals\" don't mention Papastamkos. The \"Notable Quotes\" only have that one line. \n\nSo, the response would have issueSum based on the quote, positionSum as his emphasis on the link between democracy and modern life, argSum as the reasoning behind that, and propSum as empty. But need to make sure not to include other speakers' points. \n\nI think that's all.

However, in taking stock today, we must be honest and say that the results are not particularly positive. This is due mainly to the lack of political will on the part of the Member States, as the Commissioner so honestly and boldly said, to selective sensitivity to the application of the clause, to the prevalence of double standards and, finally, to the supremacy of national interests and expediencies over the common and decisive stand of the European Union.\n\u03a4here are numerous examples and this situation is creating a serious problem of credibility of the European institutions among European citizens. On the one hand, the European Union can freeze relations and agreements \u2013 Mr Ford spoke and gave examples \u2013 and, on the other hand, it does nothing about infringements of human rights in Tunisia, Egypt, Israel or Turkey. Strategic interests take precedence in relations with Russia, China and the United States over respect for human rights and minority rights.\nThe provision of unanimity for the taking of measures and the suspension of an agreement will continue to cancel in practice any serious effort. The European Union will not be able to engage in a dynamic foreign policy with the unanimity procedure. This dimension needs to be retabled in the debate on the future of Europe. I agree with all the proposals made by my honourable friend, Mr Agnoletto. However, we must understand that the serious deficit in foreign policy and in human rights policy is due to and connected with the transnational character and unanimity provision, behind which hide national interests and various political expediencies and priorities.

The user provided a detailed debate summary about the Human Rights and Democracy Clause (HRDC) in EU external agreements. The task is to outline the main points or arguments made by Cem \u00d6zdemir from theVerts/ALE group. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided debate summary to find any mentions of Cem \u00d6zdemir. The user mentioned that contributions from other speakers shouldn't be included, only those attributed to the specified speaker.\n\nLooking at the \"Patterns and Key Issues\" section, under point 3, there's a mention of Cem \u00d6zdemir: \"Multiple speakers (e.g., Sajjad Karim, Czarnecki, \u00d6zdemir) condemned double standards...\" So, \u00d6zdemir is part of the group that criticized the EU's double standards in applying the HRDC, especially with major trade partners or when economic/political interests are involved. \n\nThe key issue here is the EU's selective application of the HRDC. The argument is that the EU's credibility is at stake because they don't apply the clause consistently. The position is that there's a need for honest, reciprocal, and universal enforcement. The proposal would be to address these double standards, but the exact proposal from \u00d6zdemir isn't detailed beyond condemning the double standards. \n\nWait, the user's example response includes issueSum, positionSum, argSum, propSum. So for \u00d6zdemir, the issue is the double standards in HRDC application. His position is opposing these double standards. The argument is that the EU's credibility is harmed by this. The proposal might be to ensure consistent application, but the debate summary doesn't specify any particular proposal from \u00d6zdemir beyond the condemnation. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to include only the points attributed to the speaker. Since the summary mentions \u00d6zdemir as part of the group that condemned double standards, but doesn't provide his specific arguments or proposals beyond that. So the issue is the double standards, the position is opposing them, the argument is about credibility, and the proposal might be the same as the general call for uniform enforcement. However, the user's example has propSum as a specific action. But in the debate summary, the actionable proposals are listed in the \"Actionable Proposals\" section, but it's not clear if \u00d6zdemir specifically proposed those. \n\nSince the user's instruction says to only include points attributed to the speaker, and the summary only mentions \u00d6zdemir in the context of condemning double standards, the response should reflect that. So, the issueSum would be about double standards, positionSum is opposing them, argSum is about EU credibility, and propSum might be the general call for uniform enforcement. But the problem is that the summary doesn't attribute specific proposals to \u00d6zdemir beyond his criticism. \n\nTherefore, the JSON should capture that. However, the user's example includes propSum even if it's a general proposal. But since the debate summary's \"Actionable Proposals\" are general, maybe the propSum here is the same as the general call for uniform enforcement. However, the user's instruction says to only include points attributed to the speaker. Since the summary doesn't mention \u00d6zdemir proposing specific actions beyond condemning double standards, the propSum might be empty. \n\nBut in the example response, even if the proposal is part of the general discussion, it's included. So perhaps the propSum would be the general proposal of ensuring uniform enforcement, but since the user says to only include what's attributed to the speaker, and the summary doesn't specify that \u00d6zdemir proposed that, maybe it's better to leave propSum as empty. However, the example given by the user includes propSum even if it's not explicitly stated. \n\nThis is a bit tricky. The user's example includes propSum as \"He advocates for strict limitations on government demands for private data\", which is directly from the debate summary. In the case of \u00d6zdemir, the summary says he condemned double standards, but doesn't mention specific proposals. Therefore, the propSum would be empty. But the user's example includes propSum even if it's part of the general discussion. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the actionable proposals are part of the general discussion, and since \u00d6zdemir is part of the group that supports those, but the summary doesn't attribute them to him. Therefore, the answer should only include the points directly mentioned. \n\nSo, the final JSON would have issueSum: \"The EU's selective application of the HRDC, particularly with major trade partners, leading to double standards.\" positionSum: \"Condemned the EU's double standards in applying the HRDC.\" argSum: \"Stated that such double standards undermine the EU's credibility.\" propSum: \"\" (empty, as no specific proposal is attributed to him).\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The EU's selective application of the HRDC, particularly with major trade partners, leading to double standards.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"Condemned the EU's double standards in applying the HRDC.\",\n\"argSum\": \"Stated that such double standards undermine the EU's credibility.\",\n\"propSum\": \"\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "gpt-4.1", "generator_model_type": "gpt", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "gpt"}, {"speaker": "Philip Claeys (NI). \u2013", "english": "Philip Claeys (NI). \u2013 (NL) Mr President, I should like to make three observations with regard to the human rights clause.\nFirst of all, it has to be noted that this clause is very rarely invoked: only 12 times since 1995. If we compare this with the number of non-democratic states with which the European Union concludes treaties, the clause must, in most cases, be regarded as redundant for all practical purposes.\nMy second remark concerns the Member States\u2019 immigration and asylum policies, which the rapporteur wishes to bracket together with the human rights clause. That strikes me as not very realistic and in any case not very desirable, certainly when developing countries would be invited to criticise the reception of their own nationals who apply for asylum in Europe. We should, in fact, make a point of encouraging such states to take back those of their nationals who do not qualify for political asylum over here. Often, though, experience has shown that the exact opposite is true.\nFinally, it is undesirable to involve non-governmental organisations in the assessment of the application of the human rights clause with regard to third countries.

The user mentioned that the speaker's name is Philip Claeys (NI). Scanning through the sections, under the \"Challenges and Reservations\" part, there's a mention of Philip Claeys. The summary states: \"Philip Claeys expressed skepticism regarding HRDC\u2019s relevance and NGOs\u2019 roles, while emphasizing migration/asylum policies should remain distinct.\"\n\nSo, the key points here are that Claeys is skeptical about the HRDC's relevance and has concerns about NGOs' roles. He also wants migration and asylum policies to be separate from the HRDC. \n\nNow, I need to structure this into the required JSON format. The fields are issueSum, positionSum, argSum, propSum. \n\nFor issueSum, the main issue is his skepticism about the HRDC's relevance and NGOs' roles. \n\nPositionSum would be his stance: he's skeptical about the HRDC's relevance and believes migration/asylum policies should be distinct. \n\nArgSum should explain the reasoning behind his position. The summary doesn't elaborate on his arguments, so maybe just state that he's skeptical without further details. \n\nPropSum would be his proposal to keep migration and asylum policies separate. \n\nI need to make sure I don't include other speakers' points. The user specified that only Claeys' contributions should be included. The example response uses concise summaries, so I'll follow that structure. \n\nDouble-checking the debate summary again to ensure there's no other info on Claeys.

Sadly, their efforts to further their own interests often prevent the Union from taking effective action.\nThe task before us today is to ensure that human rights clauses are introduced in a way that will make it possible for us to exert effective pressure on third countries. It is no longer enough to simply make a statement of principles and requirements. They need to be implemented, and that calls for a great deal of courage and determination.\nI have been saddened to note that the behaviour of the Union\u2019s leaders tends to be governed by fear and opportunism. All too often economic and political interests outweigh the need for a swift response to notorious cases where individuals are humiliated and their freedom restricted. The principle of solidarity must not be treated as if it were a ballast to be jettisoned at any time. It needs to become a crucial instrument of the European Union\u2019s policy.\nThe human rights clauses must therefore be equipped with appropriate means of persuasion and of exerting political pressure. That, in turn, requires a change in the approach to the Common Foreign and Security Policy. A permanent feature of this policy should be an ongoing struggle to defend the principles of freedom and democracy.\nWe urgently need European institutions modelled on American government-funded foundations and which are able to effectively support human rights defenders the world over. No such institutions exist at present, but the planned EU Fundamental Rights Agency should help to fill this gap. Indeed, the Human Rights Agency would be a more appropriate title for this body.\nIn its annual report, the human rights organisation Human Rights Watch concluded that during 2005 the European Union\u2019s main interests had been in the fields of business, politics and energy.\nMere verbal criticism of totalitarian and dictatorial regimes is no longer enough. The European Union must demonstrate the will to implement fundamental rights the world over. Is there anyone in the European Union currently dealing with the restrictions on freedom of expression and the activities of non-governmental organisations in Russia? Is anyone prepared to sacrifice trade contracts with China in exchange for the release of Tibetan monks imprisoned for alleged subversive activities? Will we eventually be able to bring ourselves to stand up to the Cuban regime?\nIn conclusion, I should like to express my support for the protest action against the Google search engine.

At present, human rights and democracy form the axis around which the European Union\u2019s external and security policy is being constructed. The Union\u2019s foreign policy is aimed at creating a global world order based on peace, democracy, human rights, the rule of law, sustainable development and stable growth.\nThe human rights and democracy clause should now be applied more widely and included in all agreements entered into by the European Union with third countries, regardless of whether they are industrialised or developing countries. The aforementioned clause should also feature in sectoral agreements, trade exchanges, and technical and financial aid. Pursuant to this clause, the relevant European Union institutions, including the European Parliament, should have the authority to effectively monitor respect for human rights and democratic principles by parties to agreements with the European Union. In this respect, it is important to bear in mind the relationship between respect for human rights, democracy and development. General principles encompassing the protection of human rights, the rule of law and respect for democratic values are a sine qua non for the eradication of poverty.\nA good way of dealing with this issue would be to include in such agreements a recommendation that the EU and the country party to the agreement should exchange reports on human rights on an annual basis.

The summary mentions him in the context of parliamentary involvement and oversight. Specifically, it says: \"Proposal to refuse assent to any agreement lacking an HRDC.\" Wait, but the quote attributed to Agnoletto is about Parliament's role. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the \"Patterns and Key Issues\" section, under point 2: \"Parliamentary Involvement & Oversight\" mentions Joan i Mar\u00ed. The exact sentence is: \"Parliament maintains that it has to play a part in defining the negotiating mandate for new agreements with third countries and, above all, in drafting their political and human rights objectives\" [Agnoletto].

However, the summary doesn't provide direct quotes from Joan i Mar\u00ed. The example response in the user's message shows that when there's no direct info, the response should be empty.\n\nSo, the challenge here is whether the debate summary actually includes any specific contributions from Joan i Mar\u00ed. The summary mentions that he was part of the group advocating for Parliament's role, but there's no direct statement or quote from him. The example given by the user shows that if there's no specific info, the response should be empty.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to check if there are any points attributed to Joan i Mar\u00ed.

Various interpretations of the concept of \u2018human rights\u2019 prevent the European Union from taking appropriate actions when there are gross violations. When the Council is debating the human rights situation in a state where there is cause for concern, usually one EU country or another insists on acting in its own national interest and vetoes the decision. The unanimity principle ought to be made more flexible.\nWhen debating the possibility of sanctions, inevitably the political and economic power of the target country, along with its size and the likelihood of retaliation, is considered. Such a state of affairs should be avoided where possible and certain states, which blatantly violate human rights, should not feel more equal than others.\nThe sanctions instrument, directed against one regime or another or a government, which has behaved inappropriately, must be employed with extreme precision. The stick of sanctions should not hit people, who often live in particularly harsh conditions and do not have the opportunity to oppose the regime.\nIn a few months the EU will begin negotiations with a state, which still has difficulty applying policies of gender equality and women's rights; a state, which has yet to rid itself of the shackles of ethnic discrimination.

The user provided a detailed debate summary about the Human Rights and Democracy Clause (HRDC) in EU agreements and wants me to focus on Libor Rou\u010dek's contributions.\n\nFirst, I need to check the debate summary to find any mentions of Libor Rou\u010dek. The summary mentions him in the context of advocating for broader HRDC scope. Specifically, under section 4, it says: \"Speakers such as Ji\u0159\u00ed Ma\u0161t\u00e1lka, Libor Rou\u010dek, and Katalin L\u00e9vai advocated broadening the HRDC to cover economic, social, and cultural rights, gender equality, anti-discrimination, and diversity.\"\n\nSo, the key points here are that Libor Rou\u010dek supported expanding the HRDC to include economic, social, and cultural rights, along with gender equality and anti-discrimination. The user's instructions say to only include points attributed to the speaker. The summary doesn't mention any other arguments or positions from Rou\u010dek, just this one point about expanding the HRDC's scope.\n\nNow, I need to structure this into the required JSON format. The issueSum should mention the key issue he raised, which is expanding the HRDC. The positionSum would state his position on broadening the clause. The argSum would explain the reasoning, but the summary doesn't provide arguments from him, only that he advocated for it. The propSum would be his proposal to expand the HRDC. However, the example given in the user's prompt shows that if there's no argument, it's still included. Wait, the user said if there are no points, return an empty string. But here, there is a point. \n\nWait, the user's example has \"argSum\" even if there's no argument? No, the example includes \"argSum\" even if there's no argument? Wait, the example given by the user has \"argSum\": \"His support for strict limitations on government demands for private data is based on a need to prevent improper use.\" But in the case of Libor Rou\u010dek, the summary only mentions that he advocated broadening the HRDC. There's no explicit argument given for why he did that. So, the argSum might be empty. But the user's instructions say to include the arguments used to justify positions. Since the summary doesn't mention any arguments from Rou\u010dek, maybe the argSum is empty. However, the positionSum would state his position, and the propSum would be his proposal. \n\nWait, the user's example shows that \"argSum\" is a summary of arguments used to justify positions. If there's no argument provided in the debate summary, then argSum would be empty. So, in this case, the debate summary only states that he advocated for broadening the HRDC, but doesn't explain why. Therefore, the argSum would be an empty string. However, the user's example includes an argSum even if it's just restating the position. Wait, no, in the example, the argSum is the reasoning. For instance, \"His support... is based on a need to prevent improper use.\" But in our case, the summary doesn't provide any reasoning from Rou\u010dek. Therefore, argSum would be empty. \n\nBut the user's instructions say to only include points attributed to the speaker. So, the issueSum would be \"Expanding the HRDC to include economic, social, and cultural rights, gender equality, anti-discrimination, and diversity.\" The positionSum would be \"Advocated for broadening the HRDC to cover a wider range of rights.\" The argSum would be empty, and propSum would be \"Proposed expanding the HRDC to include economic, social, and cultural rights, gender equality, anti-discrimination, and diversity.\" \n\nBut I need to check the exact wording in the debate summary. The summary says: \"advocated broadening the HRDC to cover economic, social, and cultural rights, gender equality, anti-discrimination, and diversity.\" So the main point is that he wanted the HRDC to cover these areas. Therefore, the issueSum would be about the scope of the HRDC. The positionSum is his position on expanding it. The argSum would be the reasoning, but since the summary doesn't mention any arguments from him, it's empty. The propSum is his proposal. \n\nSo the JSON would be:\n\n{\n  \"issueSum\": \"The issue of expanding the Human Rights and Democracy Clause (HRDC) to include economic, social, and cultural rights, gender equality, anti-discrimination, and diversity.\",\n  \"positionSum\": \"Libor Rou\u010dek advocated for broadening the HRDC to cover a wider range of rights beyond civil and political rights.\",\n  \"argSum\": \"\",\n  \"propSum\": \"Proposed expanding the HRDC to include economic, social, and cultural rights, gender equality, anti-discrimination, and diversity.\"\n}\n\nBut I need to make sure that the JSON is correctly formatted. Also, the user's example had \"argSum\" as a summary of arguments, but in this case, there's no argument provided. So it's empty. The user said if there are no points, return an empty string. But here, there are points (the issue, position, proposal), but no arguments. So the argSum is empty.

The task is to outline the main points made by Katalin L\u00e9vai (PSE) based on the summary.\n\nFirst, I need to locate where Katalin L\u00e9vai is mentioned in the debate summary. Scanning through the sections, under the \"Patterns and Key Issues\" part, there's a section titled \"4. Scope and Substance: Beyond Civil and Political Rights\" which mentions her. The quote says: \"Women\u2019s and children\u2019s rights, and the rights of those with different sexual orientations, are being violated every day\" [L\u00e9vai].\n\nSo, the key issue here is expanding the HRDC to include gender equality and anti-discrimination. Her position is that the HRDC should cover these areas. The argument is that these rights are being violated, so the clause needs to address them. There's no mention of proposals beyond that, so the propSum might be empty or not applicable. The user's example shows that if there's no proposal, it's left as an empty string. \n\nI need to structure the response into issueSum, positionSum, argSum, propSum. Let me check if there's more. The summary also mentions that she's part of the group advocating for broader rights, but the specific quote is about women's, children's, and LGBTQ+ rights. So the issue is the scope of HRDC, position is advocating for inclusion, argument is based on existing violations, and no specific proposal mentioned beyond that. \n\nTherefore, the JSON should reflect that.

The answer should be based solely on the provided debate summary, and since only that quote is present, the JSON should reflect that.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The effectiveness of the Human Rights and Democracy Clause (HRDC) in fostering genuine dialogue with third countries and the need for measurable progress in human rights engagement.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"Believes the HRDC has made progress and should be evaluated based on the quality of dialogue and engagement with partner countries rather than rigid adherence to principles.\",\n\"argSum\": \"Argues that the success of human rights clauses should be measured by the extent of constructive dialogue and mutual engagement, not just the presence of principles in agreements.\",\n\"propSum\": \"Advocates for a focus on genuine dialogue and progress in human rights engagement with partners, rather than overly rigid or abstract commitments.\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "gpt-4.1", "generator_model_type": "gpt", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "gpt"}, {"speaker": "President.", "english": "President.

Let me start by reading through the summary carefully.\n\nThe debate is about the Human Rights and Democracy Clause (HRDC) in EU external agreements. The user wants me to outline the main points or arguments made by the \"President\" speaker. However, looking through the summary, I need to check if there's any mention of a \"President\" speaking.\n\nLooking at the sections, there's a \"Notable Quotes\" section. Let me check there. The quotes mentioned are from Agnoletto, Ferrero-Waldner, Fern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00edn, Valenciano Mart\u00ednez-Orozco, Flautre, Papastamkos, and Sonik. There's no mention of a \"President\" in the quotes or elsewhere in the summary. \n\nThe user's example response includes a scenario where the speaker is a specific person, but in this case, the \"President\" might refer to a role rather than an individual. However, the debate summary doesn't attribute any specific statements to a \"President.\" The speakers listed are various members like Vittorio Agnoletto, Fernando Fern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00edn, etc. \n\nSince the query specifies that if there are no points attributed to the speaker, I should return an empty string. Given that the summary doesn't mention any statements from a \"President,\" the correct response would be an empty JSON object.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"\",\n\"positionSum\": \"\",\n\"argSum\": \"\",\n\"propSum\": \"\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "gpt-4.1", "generator_model_type": "gpt", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "gpt"}]
