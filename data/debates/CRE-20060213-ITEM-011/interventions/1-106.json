One of the problems is that you can often go into a supermarket now anywhere in the European Union and buy a chicken without being absolutely sure where it has come from and to what standards it has been produced.\nThe Commissioner said that consumers like to buy high-welfare-standard chickens. Yes, they do, but these need to be clearly labelled. Also, the Commissioner must be aware that a lot of the imported chicken meat that comes into Europe arrives in a partially cooked state. That way it gets around some of the EU tariffs. It then goes straight into processed food, so that when we go to buy our chicken sandwich at a motorway service station, it will probably be made from imported chicken meat and we have no idea what sort of standards it has met.\nAmendment\u00a017 to Article\u00a05 asks the Commission to bring in a clear labelling system for meat that is imported into the European Union after the legislation has been in place for six months.
