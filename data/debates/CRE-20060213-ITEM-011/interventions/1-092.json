{"speaker": "Jeffrey Titford,", "english": "Jeffrey Titford, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . \u2013 Madam President, this is a scintillating report that runs to 48\u00a0pages. It is a tour de force of bureaucratic mumbo-jumbo and statements of the blindingly obvious. The authors have provided us with such masterpieces as \u2018regular inspections of establishments by competent animal welfare inspection authorities would place a considerable burden on farms and greatly increase the size of the authorities. It would also substantially increase costs. These can be curbed by having irregular inspections carried out on a random basis\u2019. I will let Members consider the wisdom of that particular pearl in their own time.\nThis Parliament regularly churns out details like that, prepared by people who probably have not the faintest idea what it is like out in the real world, where real people have to try to put all these new rules into practice and still manage to turn a profit. Not only do the authors of this report wish to see this new regime inflicted on chicken meat producers in the 25\u00a0Member States, but they also make it clear that they expect non-EU countries to follow suit. Some chance, I would suggest!\nI come from a country that already has very high standards of animal welfare and hygiene, which are vigorously policed. We do not need a supranational bureaucratic dictatorship to tell us how to look after our chickens. The authors of this report have laid an egg and I suggest they scramble it.\n(Applause from the IND/DEM Group)", "lang": "EN", "original": "Jeffrey Titford, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . \u2013 Madam President, this is a scintillating report that runs to 48\u00a0pages.
