My answer is yes, and not just out of kindness to animals: this is linked to human health concerns.\nThe economic aspects of the industrial production of broiler chickens have rightly been taken into consideration. However, the case also concerns the limits of the safe decoding and manipulation of animals\u2019 genetic material.\nWe should have thought long ago about the dimensions of the industrial production of broiler chickens, not only for reasons of animal welfare, but also on account of the unplanned and unintended effects on the genetic material \u2013 in terms of resistance and reproduction, for example \u2013 of the animals providing our food, and the subsequent effects on us.\nThe danger of an outbreak of avian influenza is linked to the problem of control measures, and these measures do not consist only of vaccines. One of its sources is overly intensive chicken farming, which is also not ideal.
