Let me start by looking at the debate summary provided.\n\nThe user mentioned that the speaker in question is the \"President.\" However, in the debate summary, the main speakers listed are Thijs Berman (the rapporteur), Commissioner Markos Kyprianou, Åsa Westlund, Carl Schlyter, Marc Tarabella, Jan Mulder, James Nicholson, Janusz Wojciechowski, Elisabeth Jeggle, Jeffrey Titford, Jean-Claude Martinez, Karin Scheele, and others. There's no specific mention of a \"President\" in the contributions. \n\nWait, sometimes in parliamentary debates, the \"President\" could refer to the President of the European Parliament or another official. But in the summary provided, the key figures are the rapporteur, commissioners, and various members of the European Parliament. The summary doesn't attribute any statements to a \"President.\" The closing remarks were from Commissioner Kyprianou, but he's not the President. \n\nThe user's instruction says that if there are no points attributed to the speaker, I should respond with an empty string. Since the debate summary doesn't mention the President making any contributions, the answer would be empty. I should double-check the summary again to make sure I didn't miss any part where the President is quoted. \n\nLooking through the sections again: the \"Final Commission Position\" mentions Commissioner Kyprianou, but no President. The \"Procedural interventions\" might involve the President, but the summary doesn't detail those. The user's query is about the President's arguments, but the summary doesn't include any statements from the President. Therefore, the correct response is an empty string.\n</think>\n\n\"",

Some would like to us to move more in one direction, feeling perhaps that we have not gone far enough, while others may believe that we should be more conservative and that we have already gone too far. However, I believe that this proposal, as it stands with many of the amendments tabled, is a balanced, logical proposal, which strikes a balance between the need for better handling of animals, for the welfare of the animals, especially in the chicken sector, on the one hand, while at the same time taking account of the financial cost and burden which it may cause to industry and undertakings in this sector.\nHowever, we should not underestimate, first of all, the close link between the proper handling of animals and the health of the animals, and this is particularly important now that we are debating the measures which will be taken in order to combat avian influenza, which has now arrived – albeit only in wild birds – in the European Union. On the contrary, if we follow a policy of proper handling of animals, all the protective measures, all the precautions we take are much more effective. Much better supervision is being carried out, there is much better identification of the health problems which can arise and, of course, this means, from a practical point of view, fewer diseases for the animals, fewer fatalities, fewer unsuitable chickens in such cases and, hence, fewer losses and lower costs. Consequently, it may, if you look at it superficially, appear to be a cost for entrepreneurs, for producers, for farmers; however, in actual fact, it is a benefit which will result in savings and will bring producers financial benefits.\nIn addition, I would just like to state briefly that the World Bank recently issued a report setting out the financial benefits of the application of a welfare policy to animals and illustrating that there is also a financial benefit from these policies.\nThe second point I wish to comment on is, of course, the question of aid for producers. It is particularly important that they should not bear the entire cost; however, European consumers are prepared to pay more if they know that certain products have been produced on the basis of policies for the welfare and proper handling of animals. Labelling – voluntary at first – we shall be presenting a report on compulsory labelling – will give producers the opportunity to make full use of the fact that they follow a policy which is well received by European citizens and, on the basis of our studies and research, they will be able to charge something extra, because European consumers are prepared to spend more. Of course, there is also a general, multi-proposal strategy, the strategic plan for animal welfare, which was adopted recently by the Commission and will come before Parliament for debate. This proposal may have preceded the proposal on the action plan, but it is in keeping with the principles and philosophy and proposals of this action plan.\nFinally, I should like to mention the well-known question of the World Trade Organisation. I know that European producers may often feel that they are at a disadvantage to third countries. Constant efforts are being made to introduce terms and conditions for the welfare and proper handling of animals on the international market. It is not easy, but we are promoting it. The recent adoption by the World Organisation for Animal Health of principles relating to the proper treatment of animals is a first step in this direction and we shall intensify efforts in the same direction.\nNonetheless, bearing in mind the very high level of sensitivity of European consumers, we believe that labelling could give European producers an advantage.

The task is to outline the arguments made by Markos Kyprianou, the Commissioner, and ignore others.\n\nLooking at the summary, there's a section titled \"Commission Support\" where Markos Kyprianou is mentioned. The key points here are that he strongly endorsed the proposal as a balanced compromise. He argued that proper animal handling provides health benefits and economic advantages. He also mentioned that European consumers are willing to pay more if they know products are produced with animal welfare policies. Additionally, he stated the costs are minimal (2.5-8 cents per bird) and quoted Gandhi about the greatness of a nation being judged by how it treats animals.\n\nI need to make sure I only include what's attributed to Kyprianou. The summary also mentions that the Commissioner emphasized minimal costs and quoted Gandhi. There's no other mention of him elsewhere in the summary. The final commission position section again mentions Kyprianou, but it's more about the overall stance rather than new points. \n\nSo the main points are: supporting the proposal as a balanced compromise, linking animal welfare to health and economic benefits, mentioning consumer willingness to pay more, stating minimal costs, and quoting Gandhi.

He quoted Gandhi, stating that \"the greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated.\" Kyprianou also highlighted that animal welfare costs are minimal and can generate long-term savings, citing a World Bank study showing potential annual savings of \"$320,000 per year\" through welfare improvements.",

    "speaker": "Thijs Berman (PSE),",
    "english": "Thijs Berman (PSE), rapporteur . – (NL) Madam President, I hope that this week will see this House taking an important step towards sustainable European agriculture. The European Union needs to respect, and lay down in law, the five freedoms of the animal, namely freedom from thirst, hunger and malnutrition, freedom from discomfort, freedom from pain, injury and disease, freedom to express normal behaviour and freedom from fear and distress. This directive accommodates these freedoms, and that is not a moment too soon.\nIt is first and foremost the European consumers and citizens who demand respect for animals and who – in an increasing number of countries – are prepared to pay a reasonable price for it. It is good that the Commission, three weeks ago, launched the action plan for animal welfare. Agreements and rules of this kind should be European; if not, Member States will start competing against each other at the expense of animal welfare.\nThe European consumer’s main concern about animal welfare at the moment is the welfare of broiler chickens. This was fuelled by reports of overcrowding in chicken houses and of breeding methods that were aimed at achieving ever faster growth, rather than strong bone structure and stronger heart and lungs. Too many animals sustain injuries on legs and chest due to poor litter. With my report and related amendments, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has sent a clear message to the Commission and the Council in support of animal welfare and of quality requirements, but also in favour of some flexibility in respect of the poultry farmer. I have also, in my report, attempted to lay down two principles that were not yet included in the directive.\nFirst of all, genetic selection, the breeding of animals to obtain certain features, should never result in a decrease in, or threat of, the potential level of animal welfare of an animal species. This principle must be a cornerstone in any animal welfare directive.\nSecondly, animal welfare should not be treated as secondary to socio-economic considerations. With this principle in mind, it makes sense to subject the quality of the chicken houses to certain criteria. These are criteria that good poultry farmers have met for a long time, since they reduce mortality rates and thus increase the yield. As Commissioner Kyprianou has already pointed out, animal welfare is in poultry farmers’ economic interests.\nThe directive also provides for professional and daily health and welfare checks, which, particularly in this day and age, are an important preventive measure against animal diseases. Even so, poultry need more room than they are often given. The amendment that Mrs Jeggle and I have tabled specifies that maximum quantity of poultry per square metre in the few days immediately preceding their being transported to the slaughter house must come down to 38 kg per square metre and to 34 kg by 2013.\nMany EU Member States are already under or around this limit. I do not support amendments that favour even lower densities. Even though experts believe that animal welfare is at greater risk above a density of 30 kg per square metre, that is definitely not an absolute limit above which disaster is sure to strike. Above 30 kg per square metre, everything depends on good management, and that is precisely what this House can rely on. That is why the rules should be flexible in their application to farmers. Quality requirements and sanctions go hand in hand, but these should be proportionate and encourage better management. It makes no sense whatsoever to increase the severity of penalties or increase their duration for longer than is strictly necessary.\nThose who are opposed to this directive claim that global competition makes animal welfare standards of this kind impossible, and allege that Europe is subjected to stricter requirements than countries outside. As a matter of fact, that is not the case. Brazil, which is our biggest competitor in the poultry industry, already does all that this directive requires. Even if Europe were to stop bad animal welfare at its borders, Brazilian meat would still come in effortlessly.\nConsequently, the European sector will need to look at reducing costs and thus increasing the scale, or else at producing fresh, high-quality meat near the European consumer. What this directive encourages is already, we can see, becoming a trend, but that does not mean that the Commission should not place animal welfare on the agenda within the World Trade Organisation, and do so more firmly than it is doing now. I have questioned the Commission about this. What scope does the GATT Agreement offer for animal welfare? In Article 20 of this Agreement, import restrictions to protect human, animal or plant life or health are said to be justified on moral grounds. We need to press on down this road.\nEurope needs concrete proof in order to get its citizens to regain trust in the EU. Sustainable development is one of the areas where the EU can score points. Animal welfare is part of this and that is why this directive should be put into practice soon.\n(Applause)",

    "original": "Thijs Berman (PSE), Rapporteur . – Voorzitter, deze week zet het Europees Parlement naar ik hoop een belangrijke nieuwe stap op weg naar een duurzame Europese landbouw. De Europese Unie zal de vijf vrijheden van het dier moeten eerbiedigen en in wetten vastleggen. Dat zijn vrijheid van dorst, honger en ondervoeding, vrijheid van gebrek aan adequaat comfort, vrijheid van pijn, verwondingen en ziekten, vrijheid om normaal gedrag te vertonen en vrijheid van angst en stress. Deze richtlijn komt aan die vrijheden tegemoet en dat is hoog tijd.\nHet is allereerst de Europese consument en burger die om respect voor dieren vraagt en die ook in steeds meer landen bereid is om er een redelijke prijs voor te betalen. Het is een goede zaak dat de Commissie drie weken geleden het actieplan voor dierenwelzijn lanceerde. Dit soort afspraken en regels moeten Europees zijn, anders gaan lidstaten met elkaar concurreren ten koste van dierenwelzijn.\nDe ongerustheid van de Europese consument over dierenwelzijn spitst zich op dit moment toe op het welzijn van vleeskuikens. Dat kwam door berichten over overbevolking in de stallen en over fokmethoden die wel op een steeds snellere groei gericht waren, maar nog niet op een sterke bottenstructuur en op een versterking van hart en longen. Te veel dieren lijden aan wonden aan poten en borst door slecht strooisel. De landbouwcommissie heeft met mijn verslag en de amendementen erop een duidelijk signaal aan de Commissie en de Raad gegeven vóór dierenwelzijn, vóór kwaliteitseisen, maar ook voor een zekere flexibiliteit jegens de pluimveehouder. Daarnaast heb ik in mijn verslag twee principes willen vastleggen die nog niet in de richtlijn stonden.\nTen eerste mag genetische selectie, het fokken van dieren op bepaalde kenmerken, nooit lijden tot een vermindering of een bedreiging van het potentiële dierenwelzijn van een diersoort. Dit principe hoort een hoeksteen te zijn van elke dierenwelzijnsrichtlijn.\nTen tweede mogen sociaal economische overwegingen geen voorrang boven dierenwelzijn krijgen. Vanuit dit principe is het logisch om eisen te stellen aan de kwaliteit van de behuizing. Het gaat om eisen waaraan bij de goede pluimveehouders allang wordt voldaan, omdat ze de sterftecijfers verlagen en dus de opbrengst verhogen. Dierenwelzijn is in het economisch belang van de pluimveehouder. De heer Kyprianou wees er al op.\nDe richtlijn zorgt bovendien voor professionele en dagelijkse controles op de gezondheid en het welzijn en dat betekent juist in deze tijd een belangrijke vorm van preventie van dierziektes. Niettemin heeft pluimvee meer ruimte nodig dan het vaak gegeven wordt. De maximale hoeveelheid pluimvee per vierkante meter in de paar dagen vlak voor het vertrek naar het slachthuis moet omlaag, naar 38 kilo per vierkante meter en in 2013 naar 34 kilo, overeenkomstig het amendement dat ik samen met mijn collega Elizabeth Jeggle heb ingediend.\nVeel EU-lidstaten zitten nu al onder of rond die grens. Amendementen die een nog lagere dichtheid willen opleggen, steun ik niet. Volgens de experts loopt het dierenwelzijn weliswaar grotere risico's boven een dichtheid van dertig kilo per vierkante meter, maar dat is beslist geen absolute grens waarboven rampen zouden ontstaan. Boven dertig kilo per vierkante meter hangt alles af van goed management en dat is precies waar dit huis vertrouwen in mag hebben. Daarom moeten de regels ook flexibel zijn ten aanzien van de boeren. Bij kwaliteitseisen horen sancties, maar die moeten proportioneel zijn en aanzetten tot beter management.

    "formatted_summary": "Thijs Berman (PSE), Rapporteur . – Voorzitter, deze week zet het Europees Parlement naar ik hoop een belangrijke nieuwe stap op weg naar een duurzame Europese landbouw. De Europese Unie zal de vijf vrijheden van het dier moeten eerbiedigen en in wetten vastleggen. Dat zijn vrijheid van dorst, honger en ondervoeding, vrijheid van gebrek aan adequaat comfort, vrijheid van pijn, verwondingen en ziekten, vrijheid om normaal gedrag te vertonen en vrijheid van angst en stress. Deze richtlijn komt aan die vrijheden tegemoet en dat is hoog tijd.\nHet is allereerst de Europese consument en burger die om respect voor dieren vraagt en die ook in steeds meer landen bereid is om er een redelijke prijs voor te betalen. Het is een goede zaak dat de Commissie drie weken geleden het actieplan voor dierenwelzijn lanceerde. Dit soort afspraken en regels moeten Europees zijn, anders gaan lidstaten met elkaar concurreren ten koste van dierenwelzijn.\nDe ongerustheid van de Europese consument over dierenwelzijn spitst zich op dit moment toe op het welzijn van vleeskuikens. Dat kwam door berichten over overbevolking in de stallen en over fokmethoden die wel op een steeds snellere groei gericht waren, maar nog niet op een sterke bottenstructuur en op een versterking van hart en longen. Te veel dieren lijden aan wonden aan poten en borst door slecht strooisel. De landbouwcommissie heeft met mijn verslag en de amendementen erop een duidelijk signaal aan de Commissie en de Raad gegeven vóór dierenwelzijn, vóór kwaliteitseisen, maar ook voor een zekere flexibiliteit jegens de pluimveehouder. Daarnaast heb ik in mijn verslag twee principes willen vastleggen die nog niet in de richtlijn stonden.\nTen eerste mag genetische selectie, het fokken van dieren op bepaalde kenmerken, nooit lijden tot een vermindering of een bedreiging van het potentiële dierenwelzijn van een diersoort. Dit principe hoort een hoeksteen te zijn van elke dierenwelzijnsrichtlijn.\nTen tweede mogen sociaal economische overwegingen geen voorrang boven dierenwelzijn krijgen. Vanuit dit principe is het logisch om eisen te stellen aan de kwaliteit van de behuizing. Het gaat om eisen waaraan bij de goede pluimveehouders allang wordt voldaan, omdat ze de sterftecijfers verlagen en dus de opbrengst verhogen. Dierenwelzijn is in het economisch belang van de pluimveehouder. De heer Kyprianou wees er al op.\nDe richtlijn zorgt bovendien voor professionele en dagelijkse controles op de gezondheid en het welzijn en dat betekent juist in deze tijd een belangrijke vorm van preventie van dierziektes. Niettemin heeft pluimvee meer ruimte nodig dan het vaak gegeven wordt. De maximale hoeveelheid pluimvee per vierkante meter in de paar dagen vlak voor het vertrek naar het slachthuis moet omlaag, naar 38 kilo per vierkante meter en in 2013 naar 34 kilo, overeenkomstig het amendement dat ik samen met mijn collega Elizabeth Jeggle heb ingediend.\nVeel EU-lidstaten zitten nu al onder of rond die grens. Amendementen die een nog lagere dichtheid willen opleggen, steun ik niet. Volgens de experts loopt het dierenwelzijn weliswaar grotere risico's boven een dichtheid van dertig kilo per vierkante meter, maar dat is beslist geen absolute grens waarboven rampen zouden ontstaan. Boven dertig kilo per vierkante meter hangt alles af van goed management en dat is precies waar dit huis vertrouwen in mag hebben. Daarom moeten de regels ook flexibel zijn ten aanzien van de boeren. Bij kwaliteitseisen horen sancties, maar die moeten proportioneel zijn en aanzetten tot beter management. Het heeft geen enkele zin harder of langer te straffen dan strikt noodzakelijk.\nTegenstanders van deze richtlijn zeggen dat de wereldwijde concurrentie dit soort normen voor dierenwelzijn onmogelijk maakt, omdat binnen Europa zwaardere eisen zouden worden gesteld dan daarbuiten. Dat is feitelijk onjuist. De grootste rivaal in de pluimveesector, Brazilië, voldoet nu al aan deze richtlijn.

According to the conclusions drawn by the Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare and on which our decision is based, stocking density must, for example, be lower than 25 kg if major injuries and unnecessary suffering are to be avoided. In line with this, many Members have tabled amendments precisely on the subjects of stocking density and the scoring system for foot pad lesions. These changes are necessary if we are to guarantee animal protection.\nWe in the European Parliament must take expert opinion seriously and show the Council that we want to see the Commission’s proposal tightened up when it comes to animal protection. That, and not perhaps the details of our amendments, is what is most important right now. I therefore hope that, tomorrow, a majority of this Parliament will vote in favour of these amendments which, as I say, obtained considerable support in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.

Por las informaciones que he ido recogiendo, las densidades previstas en el informe de la Comisión de Agricultura y Desarrollo Rural son más que aceptables en la mayor parte de las regiones europeas, pero podrían plantear algún inconveniente en determinadas zonas muy concretas de la Unión.\nComo ponente, he intentado plasmar la opinión de la mayoría y, desde luego, en cuanto a las enmiendas, les anticipo que no tengo intención de apoyar la mayor parte de ellas. Sí me parece, no obstante, que la enmienda 42 responde a una preocupación política muy justificada, que es la de extender a las importaciones de terceros países unos mínimos estándares aplicados ya en la Unión Europea.\nEn cuanto a la enmienda 44, que suprime la puesta en marcha de un etiquetado para la carne sometida a la nueva directiva de bienestar, tengo que decirles que se contradice con la necesidad de aportar un valor añadido a esos productos para conceder mayor visibilidad a los esfuerzos que han realizado los productores europeos.\nLa Unión Europea viene produciendo en estos años una normativa abundante para mejorar el bienestar de los animales y atender una de las preocupaciones manifestadas por la opinión pública europea. De esta forma hemos conseguido mejorar considerablemente, a costa a veces de poner en riesgo la rentabilidad del sector, la protección de las gallinas ponedoras, de los terneros o de las cerdas para cría.\nHay que reconocer que este esfuerzo debería traducirse en una mejora de la calidad de los productos para el consumidor europeo, calidad que tiene que ir acompañada por una política eficaz en materia de etiquetado.\nSin embargo, apoyar las enmiendas que se han presentado, que en su mayor parte endurecen la normativa inútilmente, traerá problemas de adaptación en algunas regiones.",

    "english": "Marc Tarabella, on behalf of the PSE Group . – (FR) Madam President, this matter is in keeping with the idea that the European Union should distinguish itself from its competitors in the area of animal welfare.\nIn this matter, I should like to begin by paying tribute to the rapporteur, Mr Berman, who has tried to strike a balance between positions that were much too far apart. It must be pointed out that one criterion was emphasised above all others, that of stocking density. We should condemn the Commission proposal for recommending the automatic registration of certain data, something that seems difficult for small producers to contemplate and to write off as part of their costs. Let us return, however, to stocking density, which is the main criterion at stake.\nAn initial economic approach in Wallonia shows that, on the basis of average revenue of 72 cents per kilo, the estimated loss of annual revenue for a 1 000 square metre building would be 55% for a stocking density of 30 kg per square metre and 24% for a stocking density of 38 kg per square metre. The sector cannot absorb this estimated loss of revenue. The planned elimination of countless producers in Europe and a stagnant or rising consumer demand will inevitably benefit imports from countries that are a long way away from applying our standards, or even from considering them. Animal welfare will be the loser throughout.\nWhile I am therefore responsive to the rapporteur’s arguments aimed at moving European agriculture in the direction of sustainable agriculture, I should like, by way of conclusion, to underline two crucial elements. Firstly, moving in the direction of higher quality means that European producers will have an extra cost to bear. We should emphasise this difference and draw attention to it through the use of labels so as to put in practice, and explain the reason behind, a price differential that the Eurobarometer respondent – who is also a consumer – must be prepared to pay. Mass distribution has a key role to play in this regard.\nSecondly – and to conclude – it is crucial that we do everything in our power to ensure that the European Commission, with the help of international organisations such as the Council of Europe or the World Organisation for Animal Health, succeeds in making the WTO more compliant with the animal welfare measures.",

It may well be his first report, but I think he did a very thorough job of it. As for the report itself, while I have to say that I do not know of anyone in this House who is opposed to animal welfare – everyone is, of course, in favour of it – I do nevertheless have my doubts about this proposal, because I think there is room for improvement.\nFirst of all, it imposes the same standards across the whole of the European Union, and I can imagine that in a cold climate such as Finland or in a totally different climate such as Italy, very different standards should apply with regard to stock densities. Things may well already be different in practice. The Commission fails to take this into account in any way, and as the previous speaker said, we have not yet seen an economic analysis. It is easy to say that animal welfare must not take second place to socio-economic priorities, but some people still need to make a living out of this; what exactly are the consequences for them? Does the Commission have any idea?\nWhat matters most, of course, as has also been mentioned by many before me, including the Commissioner, although he did not manage to win me over completely, is a code of conduct. It is not very sensible, though, if we want to stress what are referred to as non-trade aspects, to table yet another fresh proposal in the middle of discussions in the World Trade Organisation, without knowing for certain that the importers comply. Why does the Commission not raise the subject of a code of conduct with the supermarkets and other large importers, and do so as soon as possible?\nWhere is the logic, if European producers are told that they need to meet such and such standards, while various supermarkets are allowed to import from the rest of the world with no restrictions, without the Commission demanding that checks of any kind be put in place? We only check for salmonella, or whatever, but we never check for animal welfare. That is what the Commission should do and that is what is missing completely from this proposal.",

It goes without saying that there must be some who have not yet got that far, or else we would not need to prescribe it by law. I think the problem also lies in the fact that many of those engaged in fattening up chickens are no longer farmers, but rather industrialists, for whom respect for life is irrelevant to the business of getting a return on capital. I can tell Mr Berman that the only conclusion we can come to from seeing the way breeding was approached is that the primary concern was not the animals’ well-being, but rather the use to which they could be put in obtaining the maximum possible profit.\nThe very sight of these pens is enough to show the urgent necessity of our enacting legislation on them. On that we agree. I do think, though, that we have to take care that this directive and this regulation do not end up leading us to aid and abet this sort of industrial production. One problem is, in fact, that these stalls are often outwardly healthy, but that is only because they are protected by prophylactic inoculations and medication, which, while preventing an outbreak, allow the germination of the variants that are currently troubling us or that make bird flu particularly to be feared. This makes the preventive measures currently being adopted for free-range animals especially problematic, for it is the good conditions under which these animals are kept that enables them to develop the strongest resistance to diseases.\nWe need to take good care that we do not end up catching the wrong people, and we must also ensure that the specialised markets for which these animals are supplied, which people accept along with the higher prices charged on them, are not run into the ground in such a way that farmers lose out.",

He raises concerns about intensive production systems that rely heavily on prophylactic medications and inoculations, which may contribute to disease variant development and bird flu risks. He also expresses concern that regulations might inadvertently harm free-range farmers who provide better animal conditions.",

He advocates for protecting free-range farming systems and specialized markets that charge higher prices for better animal welfare standards. He believes industrial producers prioritize profit over animal respect and welfare.",

In contrast, he contends that free-range animals develop stronger natural disease resistance due to better living conditions. He warns that current preventive measures may unfairly impact the farmers who maintain the highest welfare standards.",

    "formatted_summary": "Janusz Wojciechowski, on behalf of the UEN Group . – (PL ) Madam President, the regulation we are debating today lays down high standards for the rearing of broiler chickens and their welfare. These standards are needed. Within the European Union we should be striving to ensure that animals are treated as humanely as possible. This applies especially to animals raised for meat production, such as broiler chickens.\nWe should spare animals unnecessary suffering to ensure humane treatment and out of regard for the standards of our civilisation. We should do so in the interests of our own health too. There is a large body of research showing that meat from animals raised in poor conditions and subjected to constant stress is simply less healthy. However, a problem of a rather different nature has arisen. The regulation imposes high standards on European Union broiler producers, but it does not apply to importers. Maintaining high standards is expensive, which means that our producers’ meat cannot compete with meat from producers outside the Union. They are exporting to the European market meat from poultry raised in countries where such high standards are not guaranteed. Many European broiler producers are threatened with bankruptcy, because they have become less competitive due to the fact that they have to meet high European Union standards.\nThe same standards should be imposed on imports as on meat produced within the Union, not only for the sake of the broiler chickens but also for the benefit of their producers and especially for the good of the consumers. The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development adopted an amendment tabled by the Union for the Europe of the Nations Group calling on the European Commission to ensure that these high standards are also met in the case of imported meat.\nI believe this should be a general principle that should apply not only to poultry but to all agricultural products.

Let me look through the summary provided.\n\nThe user mentioned that the task is to outline the main points or arguments made by the specific speaker, in this case, Janusz Wojciechowski. The key here is to only include what's attributed to him and ignore others. \n\nLooking at the debate summary, under the \"Import Standards and Labeling Solutions\" section, there's a mention of Janusz Wojciechowski. The quote is: \"the same standards should be imposed on imports as on meat produced within the Union, not only for the sake of the broiler chickens but also for the benefit of their producers\" [Wojciechowski, 2006-02-13]. \n\nSo his main argument here is about extending EU standards to imports. He's saying that imports should meet the same standards as EU-produced meat. The reason given is not just for the chickens' welfare but also to benefit the producers. That seems to be the only point attributed to him in the summary. \n\nI should check if there's any other mention of him elsewhere. Scanning through the other sections: the \"Economic Competitiveness Concerns\" section mentions Marc Tarabella, Jan Mulder, James Nicholson. The \"Opposition and Alternative Perspectives\" has Jeffrey Titford and Jean-Claude Martinez. The \"Scientific and Implementation Concerns\" has Karin Scheele. So no other mentions of Wojciechowski. \n\nTherefore, the only point is his argument about import standards. The user wants the main points, so I should present that clearly. Since the user said if there are no points, respond with an empty string, but here there is one point. So the answer should be that he advocated for extending EU standards to imports to protect both animal welfare and producers.\n</think>\n\nJanusz Wojciechowski argued that **imported meat should be subject to the same welfare standards as EU-produced meat**, stating: \"the same standards should be imposed on imports as on meat produced within the Union, not only for the sake of the broiler chickens but also for the benefit of their producers\" [Wojciechowski, 2006-02-13].

    "english": "Jean-Claude Martinez (NI). – (FR) Madam President, we are all clearly in favour of protecting chickens kept for meat production from the barbarity in the concentration camp-style farms. Many a time in this very Chamber have I denounced the disgraceful industrial farms, in which up to 80 million male chicks have been burnt alive to heat up the farms. I have denounced the way in which the chickens are slaughtered using electric stunning techniques. In fact, the chickens are not completely stunned, with the result that they are plunged into hot water while they are still alive: they are boiled so that they can be plucked.\nWe therefore all agree that rules are needed. However, when European farmers read the directive, what do they see? They see that the broiler chicken is subjected to two daily medical visits, which are carried out by a veterinary surgeon who must be at least three metres away from the chicken; the area in which the chickens are kept must be illuminated by a non-flickering light with an intensity of 50 lux, 20 lux or 100 lux – no one quite knows – measured at bird eye level; the inside temperature of the farm must not exceed the outside temperature measured in the shade by more than 3˚C; the chicken’s litter must be 5 cm deep; certificates are required for the purposes of keeping chickens and of castrating chicks that are less than ten days’ old; the chickens’ foot pads must be examined, and the stocking density of the chickens must be limited to 28, 30, 35 or 42 kilograms per square metre, although it is not specified whether this means one kilo liveweight or metabolic weight.\nMeanwhile, thousands of chickens are being slaughtered in Nigeria, and avian influenza is going to strike down 1.1 billion African chickens. All of this because we did not find the EUR 800 million that would have made it possible to administer to each African chicken the two necessary vaccines, at a cost of 40 cents per dose. I could also try to add a touch of black humour here. Faced with this deluge of precautions that are reserved for white chickens while black children are dying of leprosy, AIDS and tuberculosis, the little African child is going to end up saying: ‘when I grow up, I am not going to be a fireman, I am going to be a broiler chicken in Europe!\nIn the meantime, our Breton farms, for example, are relocating to Brazil – the leader in poultry farming – where not only are the chickens unprotected, but the children are too. The latter are treated like slaves so that the Brazilian farms can be kept in operation, and that is without mentioning the banana plantations, in which little eight-year-olds fall asleep exhausted on cardboard boxes and come into contact with plant-care products that make them dizzy, all for just USD 2 a day. Well, everyone has his or her own idea of what is most important. Some people choose white chickens whereas I, for my part, choose African children and Asian children. That is where foolishness leads you when you try to act virtuously and, with this directive, we are acting stupidly.",

Some 5 billion broiler chickens are slaughtered in the European Union every year, and the great challenge presented by this report is that of finding a balance between the protection of animals, which is necessary, and the protection of jobs in the commercial production of broiler chickens.\nThere is no doubt – not least in the minds of those who breed and keep chickens for fattening – about the rightness of our making a joint proposal for the improvement and harmonisation of the conditions under which they are kept in the EU.\nI, too, endorse the report, but the producers operate, even today, with the tightest of profit margins. If standards are raised within the Community, they will in particular face the problem of imports from third states, where standards in production are far inferior to our own. I therefore call for the introduction of binding rules on labelling, founded upon compliance with standards of protection, which will be effective, binding and harmonised right across Europe.\nSecondly, I call for certain standards in the keeping and production of broiler chickens and other agricultural products to be demanded in future WTO negotiations. The EU’s high standard in food production should become an advantage for producers in the EU. While we want our animals to be protected, we cannot, at the same time, allow our producers to be put in a disadvantaged position.\nThe current threat of bird flu is another reminder to us of how important it is that broiler chickens should be produced safely, in adequate quantities and on a sound economic basis.",

Der hohe EU-Standard in der Nahrungsmittelproduktion soll zum Vorteil für die Produzenten in der EU werden. Wir wollen Tierschutz; wir dürfen es dabei aber nicht zulassen, dass unsere Produzenten benachteiligt werden.\nAuch die aktuelle Bedrohung durch die Vogelgrippe sagt uns, dass wir Wert auf sichere, ausreichende und wirtschaftliche Masthähnchenproduktion in Europa legen müssen.",

    "english": "María Isabel Salinas García (PSE). – (ES) Madam President, the welfare of animals in farms has traditionally been an ethical issue. Due to numerous food crises, it has now also become a public health issue. Specific legislation in this area has therefore become urgent. I believe that that is something on which we have all agreed during this debate.\nIn producing this legislation, however, we must keep our feet on the ground. We must produce a viable and credible proposal, not restrict ourselves to making pointless gestures, which give the impression of being inconsistent with the Council’s current figures.\nI therefore believe that the report by the rapporteur, Mr Berman, whom I congratulate, combines a genuine concern for the welfare of animals, taking account of scientific data at all times, with the necessary flexibility in its application to make it possible for producers to accept the measures proposed and adapt to them. On the one hand, measures are proposed to prevent the practices that lead to pointless and gratuitous suffering for the animal, and, on the most hotly debated and controversial point — stocking density — credible and applicable figures are laid down that represent significant progress in this field and which are acceptable to the Council. I believe that we must show responsibility — and we have done this in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.\nFurthermore, this proposal maintains the necessary flexibility with regard to producers, which makes this minimal regulation genuinely applicable in the countries of the Union, and does not lead — as is usually the case — to the unnecessary closure of farms.\nI believe that it provides the necessary firmness in laying down the regulations with a gradual application of sanctions and an estimation of the costs for producers with a view to ensuring that the burdens stemming from the directive do not fall to them — as is almost always the case.\nIn conclusion, I would ask you to support the Berman report, in the form presented by the rapporteur and as supported by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. I believe that it is a measured and balanced proposal that takes account of the interests of all of the parties, which is not always an easy task. There is no question that its approval will have positive effects in terms of the quality of the final product, that is to say, for the well-being of European consumers.",

We also welcome the new action programme presented by our Commissioner. That does not, however, take away from the fact that, while it is clear that the European public does not think highly of animal welfare in Europe – God only knows why, though, for Europe does apply the world’s strictest standards – their behaviour as consumers is often very different, and that is where the problem lies.\nThis means that whilst we can introduce stricter standards in Europe, at the same time we could open the floodgates to imports if they are unrestricted. One could say that we do not make that mistake in the World Trade Organisation and that although Europe tries its hardest, more should be done. We can come to an agreement with regard to imports and import quotas. We can also do a deal with regard to labelling. We can also agree that we in Europe will in any event commit to those who have launched special projects, including the people behind the farmer’s chicken in the Netherlands and the ‘label rouge’ in France. It should be possible to support them by giving them extra incentives, so that consumers will buy their products. The CDA prefers this way of working, because otherwise we will produce yet more European legislation, which consumers may applaud well as citizens, but in respect of which they will display different purchase behaviour the minute they walk into a supermarket.\nIt is essential that what the public want is also translated into consumer behaviour. That is the very reason we are very critical of this report. We will be voting in favour of Amendment 42, by means of which something will at least be done about imports, and we will also support everything in this report that is related to improved recognisability through meat labelling.\nAs long as there are no guarantees, though, that imports can be subjected to the same criteria, as long as we are once again putting the European farmer on the back foot and are again making things more difficult for animal welfare in Europe, it will be extremely difficult for us to vote in favour of this report.",

Dat neemt niet weg dat, hoewel duidelijk is dat de Europese burger geen hoge pet van het dierenwelzijn in Europa op heeft – je vraagt je overigens af hoe hij bij die mening komt, aangezien Europa wel de strengste normen ter wereld heeft – toch blijkt dat hij als consument vaak een heel ander gedrag vertoont. Daar zit een probleem.\nDat betekent dat we wel strengere normen kunnen invoeren in Europa, maar tegelijkertijd de kraan openzetten, als we niets doen aan de import. Je kunt zeggen dat we die fout niet maken binnen de Wereldhandelsorganisatie en dat Europa wel probeert, maar er moet meer mogelijk zijn. We kunnen met betrekking tot import, de geïmporteerde hoeveelheden, afspraken maken. We kunnen ook afspraken maken met betrekking tot de etikettering. We kunnen ook afspreken dat we in Europa in ieder geval gaan werken voor diegenen die wel bijzondere projecten hebben, zoals de mensen achter de boerenkip in Nederland en het “label rouge” in Frankrijk. Het moet mogelijk zijn om deze met extra stimulansen te ondersteunen, zodat consumenten die producten ook kopen. Die manier is voor het CDA beter, want anders hebben we opnieuw Europese wetgeving, wat de consument als burger misschien toejuicht, maar op het moment dat hij in de supermarkt staat, vertoont hij een ander koopgedrag.\nHet is essentieel dat wat de burger wil, ook vertaald wordt in het gedrag van de consument. Om die reden zijn wij zeer kritisch over dit verslag. We zullen vóór amendement 42 stemmen, waarmee in ieder geval iets wordt gedaan aan de import, en we zullen ook alles in dit verslag steunen dat betrekking heeft op een betere herkenbaarheid door etikettering van het vlees.\nMaar zolang er geen garantie is dat we aan import dezelfde eisen kunnen stellen, zolang wij op die manier de Europese boer weer in een nadelige positie plaatsen en het opnieuw moeilijker voor het dierenwelzijn in Europa maken, wordt het voor ons erg moeilijk om voor dit verslag te stemmen.",

    "english": "Csaba Sándor Tabajdi (PSE). – (HU) Poultry breeding and rearing is the progressive, profitable sector of European livestock farming. A few months ago no one would have questioned this statement. Today however, poultry farmers are facing a new threat after the bird flu: the current regulation.\nThe current draft regulation, which has given more consideration to animal welfare than to industry sector and economic arguments, threatens the competitiveness of this sector. Animal welfare aspects should indeed be taken into consideration. But we should not overshoot the target by imposing unrealistically strict regulations which force our farmers into a severe competitive disadvantage, endangering their livelihood. These people do not intend to be cruel to their animals – they just want to earn a living by doing what they are good at. Therefore, excessively strict regulations are unacceptable. Additionally, the planned excessive restrictions may lead to serious tension on internal markets, as well, because non-EU countries such as Brazil, which do not have to comply with these strict regulations, are able to sell their poultry products on European Union markets at significantly lower prices. The majority of average consumers, at least in the new Member States, choose the cheaper product, because their income does not allow them to pay a higher price for basic food, just because they are environmentally aware or care about animal welfare. In view of the professional, economic and animal welfare considerations, the acceptable stocking density would be 34 kilograms of live weight per square metre, with a maximum upper limit of 42 kilograms of live weight per square metre. Any figures included in the report that are lower than these are not acceptable.\nLet us trust in the expertise of poultry farmers, as none of them would be able to achieve good results with sick animals, which means that their primary interest is to conduct a rationalised economic activity, taking into account animal welfare considerations. Let us not make their task so difficult that they may be forced to give up poultry breeding altogether!",

It has achieved as good a balance as one could expect, because I recognise that this is not an easy area in which to balance all the different interests.\nTwo weeks ago, a poultry-processing plant in Northern Ireland closed with the loss of over 400 jobs, not to mention the other jobs on the farms and in the feed compound mills. The reason given was that they could no longer compete with cheap imports from Asia and South America.\nI happen to believe that there is no such thing as cheap food. If food is cheap, it is not meeting the standards. Therefore I have to ask myself: is the chicken meat produced to our existing standards, never mind the proposed increased standards?\nI support the part of the report that states, in Amendment 17, that we must insist on the same standards in third countries as in the European Union.

The quote provided is: \"there is no such thing as cheap food. If food is cheap, it is not meeting the standards\" [Nicholson, 2006-02-13], and he advocated for equal import standards and proper labeling.\n\nSo, the key points from Nicholson are:\n1. His statement that cheap food isn't meeting standards, implying that low prices might mean lower welfare standards.\n2. His advocacy for equal import standards, meaning that imported products should meet the same EU welfare standards as those produced within the EU.\n3. His call for proper labeling to inform consumers.\n\nI need to make sure there are no other mentions of Nicholson elsewhere in the summary. Scanning through the other sections, there's a mention of him in the \"Economic Competitiveness Concerns\" section. The other parts talk about other speakers like Marc Tarabella, Jan Mulder, etc., but not Nicholson. \n\nThe user's instruction says to exclude arguments from other speakers, so I should only include what's directly attributed to Nicholson. The summary doesn't mention any other points from him. Therefore, the main points are the two mentioned: the link between cheap food and standards, and the need for equal import standards and labeling.\n</think>\n\nJames Nicholson (PPE-DE) argued that \"there is no such thing as cheap food.

To look at the bigger picture, I say that this demonstrates our humanity towards all our fellow inhabitants of this planet.\nHowever, we must accept that, as has already been said, all this increases the cost of production in the European Union. On the other hand, of course, we allow chickens to come in from third countries; we allow everything to come in except weapons. In this way, we are causing European poultry farmers to close their poultry farms. This is unfortunate on two counts: both for the poultry farmers, a class for which we should show solidarity, and for the chickens, because we shall arrive at the point, in a few years' time, where chicken products will be imported from third countries which are produced without any protection as regards a decent life for the animals. Unless we want to be hypocrites, we must find a way of controlling the living conditions of chickens in third countries; otherwise we should not permit imports.\nLabelling, which Mr Kyprianou, referred to, is a very good idea, we think it is an excellent idea and we want to proceed towards this sector, but we also need to think about subsidising poultry farmers for the costs relating solely to the measures we impose on them.

    "english": "Karin Scheele (PSE). – (DE) Mr President, the farming of chickens for meat production is one of the most intensive of farming systems, involving major problems for the welfare and health of the animals. Today sees us discussing for the first time minimum rules for the protection of broiler chickens; previously, there were only the general provisions of the directive on the protection of farmed animals. This move on the part of the Commission is therefore to be welcomed, as is also Mr Berman’s report, and those who have been following the debate, with points of criticism and interventions flying off in all directions, have completed a difficult exercise.\nOne can take a positive view of Article 1 of the Commission proposal, according to which the Member States are at liberty to enact more stringent provisions, but those that the directive proposes are inadequate in certain respects, the issue most frequently discussed today has been that of how much stocking density can be allowed in terms of kilos of live weight per square metre. The Commission claims to be taking as its basis the report that the Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare produced in 2000, but that is not in fact the case, for this report explicitly states that the occupying density must not exceed 25 kg per square metre if more serious problems for the animals’ well-being are to be avoided. Article 3 of the Commission proposal prescribes 30 kg per square metre live weight.\nI endorse Amendment 53 from Mr Jørgensen, Mr Bowis and Mr Sacconi, which prescribes that chickens should be kept at a density of 25 kg per square metre, and that this density may be increased to a maximum of 30 kg per square metre if the owner complies with certain conditions.",

I will simply add that the farmers’ welfare is also a noble cause and, in our view, a high-priority cause. This sector is already seriously threatened by non-European competition. I heard one of my fellow Members say a short while ago that there had been no farm closures, but that is incorrect because this is already a widespread phenomenon across the European territory. I will simply mention my own region – Brittany – which represents 35% of the French production of broiler chickens and which, above all, accounts for 18 000 jobs, 11 000 of which are in the agricultural and food industries. This is a region in which farms are currently being closed.\nClearly, if the current – and already very serious – distortions of competition increase, then we will witness a massive influx of products from third countries, coupled with a fall in our exports. Of course, it is all very well being told ‘produce high-quality goods’, but we know that adapting and restructuring are very risky, and in any case require a great deal of time.\nA great deal of work has been done on this matter, but there are nevertheless some real shortcomings in the justifications of this text. I will mention the thresholds, which seem to give rise to a virtue contest, with the thresholds being set at the lowest levels possible; next, the assessment indicators of the ‘breeding contests’; and lastly, and above all, the impact study of the repercussions in terms of the elimination of farms and jobs in the sector.\nTo conclude, I should like to pose a question to Commissioner Kiprianou. Commissioner, in the current context of the threat of avian influenza, which is approaching Europe, or even already in Europe, how should one go about tackling the paradox between, on the one hand, high European standards in respect of animal welfare and, on the other, the necessary national measures for keeping poultry indoors?

J’ajouterai simplement que le bien-être des éleveurs est également une noble cause et, pour nous, une cause prioritaire. Or, ce secteur est déjà gravement menacé par la concurrence extra-européenne. J’entendais tout à l’heure un collègue dire qu’il n’y avait pas de fermeture d’exploitations. Mais si, ce phénomène est déjà très largement engagé sur le territoire européen. Je citerai simplement ma région, la Bretagne, qui représente 35% de la production française de poulets de chair et surtout 18 000 emplois dont 11 000 dans les industries agricoles et alimentaires. C’est une région dans laquelle on enregistre actuellement des fermetures d’exploitation.\nÀ l’évidence, si les distorsions de concurrence actuelles déjà très lourdes se renforcent, on assistera à une arrivée massive de produits venant de pays tiers et à la chute de nos exportations. Certes, on nous dit «faites de la production de qualité», c’est bien mais nous savons que l’adaptation ou la reconversion sont très aléatoires, et demandent en tout état de cause beaucoup de temps.\nBeaucoup de travail a été fait sur ce dossier mais il existe tout de même de vraies lacunes dans les justifications du texte en discussion. J’évoquerai les seuils qui semblent donner lieu à un concours de vertu avec la fixation à des niveaux les plus bas possibles; les indicateurs d’évaluation des concours d’élevage; et surtout, l’étude d’impact sur les répercussions en termes de disparition d’élevages et d’emplois dans la filière.\nPour terminer, je voudrais poser une question à M. le commissaire Kiprianou. Monsieur le Commissaire, dans le contexte actuel de la menace de la grippe aviaire qui est aux portes de l’Europe, voire même déjà en Europe, comment faire face au paradoxe entre, d’une part, des normes européennes élevées de bien-être animal et, d’autre part, les nécessaires mesures nationales de confinement des volailles.

Perhaps I should have quoted Mahatma Ghandi earlier: ‘The greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated’. In the European Union, thank God, we have a very high level of civilisation. The largest number of letters and complaints I have received from European citizens concerns animal welfare, in particular broilers. So this proposal reflects the views of European citizens. It is based on science, but also on consultations with all the stakeholders over a period of three years to take account of all their views and concerns. It is a compromise. Some would like us to go further and have said it is a low-standard proposal. Others say we have gone too far. It is a step towards protecting the welfare of animals, but it also takes into account the interests of the producers.\nCompetitiveness is certainly important, but we know that the cost imposed on production by animal welfare standards is very low, something between 2.5 and 8 cents per bird. The other costs affect competitiveness. But I do not believe that European producers can compete on the basis of cost. They should compete on the basis of quality. I have some photographs here of the dermatitis caused by this intensive farming and I do not think that any European consumer would be willing to eat these birds; it is just that they do not know about it. So awareness and education are the best policy, together with labelling, which is very important. We have letters; we have Eurobarometer. European citizens are ready to pay more, provided they know, and we are working on that.\nOn the issue of avian flu, best practices in animal welfare help us implement preventive measures more effectively, to protect the industry and the birds from avian flu. If it is easier to detect sick animals, it is easier to control the situation, and therefore these proposals on animal welfare and protection against avian flu are compatible.\nRegarding the amendments, because of the lack of time we will circulate a full list of those that have been accepted and those that have not. I would ask that this list be included in the verbatim report of proceedings of this sitting (1) . Many of the amendments were accepted because they are compatible with the philosophy of the proposal. Others cannot be accepted, mostly for technical reasons or because the provisions are already included in existing legislation. Proposals such as those that take account of climatic conditions, types of production, training of staff and the way the checks should be performed can all be accepted.\nOne of the most sensitive issues was density. We feel that the proposal is a reasonable compromise. It meets the standards, it improves the situation and it establishes conditions and controls. We would therefore prefer that Parliament accept the Commission’s proposal on that point and we cannot accept that amendment.\nConcerning mandatory labelling, we feel – and I agree with Mr Parish that it is very important – that six months is a rather short period. It would be very difficult to produce a substantial report with specific proposals, so we need more time for that.\nFinally, on the issue of cost, not everything can be measured in monetary terms, but I know it is a very important aspect. Animal welfare is a very small part of the production cost. I mentioned earlier that in one of the cases the World Bank studied, with the adoption of a very small number of improvements in the treatment of birds, a farm managed to save USD 320 000 per year. I think that proves that adopting animal welfare policies is only really a cost in the short term; eventually it makes a profit and there is a financial benefit for the producers.\nI would like to thank Members again for their support for this proposal, which is a big step towards improving animal welfare in the European Union.",

The task is to outline the main points attributed to Markos Kyprianou, the Commissioner mentioned.\n\nLooking at the summary, there's a section titled \"Commission Support\" where Markos Kyprianou is mentioned. The key points here are that he strongly endorsed the proposal as a balanced compromise. He argued that proper animal handling provides health benefits and economic advantages. He also mentioned that European consumers are willing to pay more for products with good animal welfare standards. Additionally, he cited Gandhi's quote about the greatness of a nation being judged by how it treats its animals. The Commission's position is that the proposal is a reasonable compromise, accepting many amendments but rejecting those on density limits. Kyprianou emphasized minimal costs (2.5-8 cents per bird) and mentioned a World Bank study about savings from welfare improvements.\n\nI need to make sure I only include what's attributed to Kyprianou.

Kyprianou cited Gandhi’s quote about a nation’s moral progress being judged by its treatment of animals.

They want me to outline the main points or arguments made by Richard Corbett (PSE), but only the ones attributed to him. The challenge is that the debate summary doesn't mention Richard Corbett at all. \n\nFirst, I need to check the entire summary again to make sure I didn't miss any references. The summary lists several speakers: Thijs Berman, Markos Kyprianou, Åsa Westlund, Carl Schlyter, Marc Tarabella, Jan Mulder, James Nicholson, Janusz Wojciechowski, Elisabeth Jeggle, Jeffrey Titford, Jean-Claude Martinez, Karin Scheele, and others. But Richard Corbett isn't mentioned anywhere.\n\nThe user's instructions say that if there are no points attributed to the speaker, I should respond with an empty string. Since the summary doesn't include any contributions from Richard Corbett, the correct response is an empty string. I need to make sure I'm not adding any information not present in the provided debate summary. Even though the user might expect some input, the task is to strictly adhere to the given data. So, the answer here is an empty string because there's no mention of Richard Corbett's arguments in the provided text.\n</think>\n\n\"",
