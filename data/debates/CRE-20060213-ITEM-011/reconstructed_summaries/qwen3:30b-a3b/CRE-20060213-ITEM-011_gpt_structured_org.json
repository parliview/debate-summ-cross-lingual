The European Union needs to respect, and lay down in law, the five freedoms of the animal, namely freedom from thirst, hunger and malnutrition, freedom from discomfort, freedom from pain, injury and disease, freedom to express normal behaviour and freedom from fear and distress. This directive accommodates these freedoms, and that is not a moment too soon.\nIt is first and foremost the European consumers and citizens who demand respect for animals and who \u2013 in an increasing number of countries \u2013 are prepared to pay a reasonable price for it. It is good that the Commission, three weeks ago, launched the action plan for animal welfare. Agreements and rules of this kind should be European; if not, Member States will start competing against each other at the expense of animal welfare.\nThe European consumer\u2019s main concern about animal welfare at the moment is the welfare of broiler chickens. This was fuelled by reports of overcrowding in chicken houses and of breeding methods that were aimed at achieving ever faster growth, rather than strong bone structure and stronger heart and lungs. Too many animals sustain injuries on legs and chest due to poor litter. With my report and related amendments, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has sent a clear message to the Commission and the Council in support of animal welfare and of quality requirements, but also in favour of some flexibility in respect of the poultry farmer. I have also, in my report, attempted to lay down two principles that were not yet included in the directive.\nFirst of all, genetic selection, the breeding of animals to obtain certain features, should never result in a decrease in, or threat of, the potential level of animal welfare of an animal species. This principle must be a cornerstone in any animal welfare directive.\nSecondly, animal welfare should not be treated as secondary to socio-economic considerations. With this principle in mind, it makes sense to subject the quality of the chicken houses to certain criteria. These are criteria that good poultry farmers have met for a long time, since they reduce mortality rates and thus increase the yield. As Commissioner Kyprianou has already pointed out, animal welfare is in poultry farmers\u2019 economic interests.\nThe directive also provides for professional and daily health and welfare checks, which, particularly in this day and age, are an important preventive measure against animal diseases. Even so, poultry need more room than they are often given. The amendment that Mrs Jeggle and I have tabled specifies that maximum quantity of poultry per square metre in the few days immediately preceding their being transported to the slaughter house must come down to 38 kg per square metre and to 34 kg by 2013.\nMany EU Member States are already under or around this limit. I do not support amendments that favour even lower densities. Even though experts believe that animal welfare is at greater risk above a density of 30 kg per square metre, that is definitely not an absolute limit above which disaster is sure to strike. Above 30 kg per square metre, everything depends on good management, and that is precisely what this House can rely on. That is why the rules should be flexible in their application to farmers. Quality requirements and sanctions go hand in hand, but these should be proportionate and encourage better management. It makes no sense whatsoever to increase the severity of penalties or increase their duration for longer than is strictly necessary.\nThose who are opposed to this directive claim that global competition makes animal welfare standards of this kind impossible, and allege that Europe is subjected to stricter requirements than countries outside. As a matter of fact, that is not the case. Brazil, which is our biggest competitor in the poultry industry, already does all that this directive requires. Even if Europe were to stop bad animal welfare at its borders, Brazilian meat would still come in effortlessly.\nConsequently, the European sector will need to look at reducing costs and thus increasing the scale, or else at producing fresh, high-quality meat near the European consumer. What this directive encourages is already, we can see, becoming a trend, but that does not mean that the Commission should not place animal welfare on the agenda within the World Trade Organisation, and do so more firmly than it is doing now. I have questioned the Commission about this. What scope does the GATT Agreement offer for animal welfare? In Article 20 of this Agreement, import restrictions to protect human, animal or plant life or health are said to be justified on moral grounds. We need to press on down this road.\nEurope needs concrete proof in order to get its citizens to regain trust in the EU. Sustainable development is one of the areas where the EU can score points. Animal welfare is part of this and that is why this directive should be put into practice soon.\n(Applause)", "lang": "NL", "original": "Thijs Berman (PSE), Rapporteur . \u2013 Voorzitter, deze week zet het Europees Parlement naar ik hoop een belangrijke nieuwe stap op weg naar een duurzame Europese landbouw. De Europese Unie zal de vijf vrijheden van het dier moeten eerbiedigen en in wetten vastleggen. Dat zijn vrijheid van dorst, honger en ondervoeding, vrijheid van gebrek aan adequaat comfort, vrijheid van pijn, verwondingen en ziekten, vrijheid om normaal gedrag te vertonen en vrijheid van angst en stress. Deze richtlijn komt aan die vrijheden tegemoet en dat is hoog tijd.\nHet is allereerst de Europese consument en burger die om respect voor dieren vraagt en die ook in steeds meer landen bereid is om er een redelijke prijs voor te betalen. Het is een goede zaak dat de Commissie drie weken geleden het actieplan voor dierenwelzijn lanceerde. Dit soort afspraken en regels moeten Europees zijn, anders gaan lidstaten met elkaar concurreren ten koste van dierenwelzijn.\nDe ongerustheid van de Europese consument over dierenwelzijn spitst zich op dit moment toe op het welzijn van vleeskuikens. Dat kwam door berichten over overbevolking in de stallen en over fokmethoden die wel op een steeds snellere groei gericht waren, maar nog niet op een sterke bottenstructuur en op een versterking van hart en longen. Te veel dieren lijden aan wonden aan poten en borst door slecht strooisel. De landbouwcommissie heeft met mijn verslag en de amendementen erop een duidelijk signaal aan de Commissie en de Raad gegeven v\u00f3\u00f3r dierenwelzijn, v\u00f3\u00f3r kwaliteitseisen, maar ook voor een zekere flexibiliteit jegens de pluimveehouder. Daarnaast heb ik in mijn verslag twee principes willen vastleggen die nog niet in de richtlijn stonden.\nTen eerste mag genetische selectie, het fokken van dieren op bepaalde kenmerken, nooit lijden tot een vermindering of een bedreiging van het potenti\u00eble dierenwelzijn van een diersoort. Dit principe hoort een hoeksteen te zijn van elke dierenwelzijnsrichtlijn.\nTen tweede mogen sociaal economische overwegingen geen voorrang boven dierenwelzijn krijgen. Vanuit dit principe is het logisch om eisen te stellen aan de kwaliteit van de behuizing. Het gaat om eisen waaraan bij de goede pluimveehouders allang wordt voldaan, omdat ze de sterftecijfers verlagen en dus de opbrengst verhogen. Dierenwelzijn is in het economisch belang van de pluimveehouder. De heer Kyprianou wees er al op.\nDe richtlijn zorgt bovendien voor professionele en dagelijkse controles op de gezondheid en het welzijn en dat betekent juist in deze tijd een belangrijke vorm van preventie van dierziektes. Niettemin heeft pluimvee meer ruimte nodig dan het vaak gegeven wordt. De maximale hoeveelheid pluimvee per vierkante meter in de paar dagen vlak voor het vertrek naar het slachthuis moet omlaag, naar 38 kilo per vierkante meter en in 2013 naar 34 kilo, overeenkomstig het amendement dat ik samen met mijn collega Elizabeth Jeggle heb ingediend.\nVeel EU-lidstaten zitten nu al onder of rond die grens. Amendementen die een nog lagere dichtheid willen opleggen, steun ik niet. Volgens de experts loopt het dierenwelzijn weliswaar grotere risico's boven een dichtheid van dertig kilo per vierkante meter, maar dat is beslist geen absolute grens waarboven rampen zouden ontstaan. Boven dertig kilo per vierkante meter hangt alles af van goed management en dat is precies waar dit huis vertrouwen in mag hebben. Daarom moeten de regels ook flexibel zijn ten aanzien van de boeren. Bij kwaliteitseisen horen sancties, maar die moeten proportioneel zijn en aanzetten tot beter management. Het heeft geen enkele zin harder of langer te straffen dan strikt noodzakelijk.\nTegenstanders van deze richtlijn zeggen dat de wereldwijde concurrentie dit soort normen voor dierenwelzijn onmogelijk maakt, omdat binnen Europa zwaardere eisen zouden worden gesteld dan daarbuiten. Dat is feitelijk onjuist. De grootste rivaal in de pluimveesector, Brazili\u00eb, voldoet nu al aan deze richtlijn. Zelfs al zou Europa slecht dierenwelzijn tegenhouden aan de grens, dan nog kan het Braziliaanse vlees moeiteloos binnen.\nDe Europese sector zal zich daarom ofwel moeten richten op kostenbesparing en dus schaalvergroting, ofwel of de productie van vers vlees van hoge kwaliteit dicht bij de Europese consument. Die ontwikkeling is er al en wordt door deze richtlijn aangemoedigd. Dat neemt niet weg dat de Commissie dierenwelzijn binnen de Wereldhandelsorganisatie aan de orde moet stellen en krachtiger dan nu. Ik heb de Commissie hierover vragen gesteld. Welke mogelijkheden biedt het GATT-verdrag voor dierenwelzijn? In artikel 20 ervan worden importbeperkingen ter wille van de volksgezondheid, de gezondheid van dieren en planten en om morele redenen geoorloofd genoemd.

The user provided a detailed debate summary about broiler chicken welfare in the European Parliament, and they want me to focus on \u00c5sa Westlund's contributions.\n\nFirst, I need to find where \u00c5sa Westlund is mentioned in the debate summary. Scanning through the sections, under \"Key Positions and Arguments\" in the \"In Favour of Stricter Welfare Standards\" section, there's a mention of \u00c5sa Westlund (PSE). The summary says she welcomed the Commission\u2019s proposal as an improvement but argued that the proposed level is too low on animal welfare. She called for densities below 25 kg/m\u00b2 and a \"point system for footpad lesions.\"\n\nSo, the main points from her speech are:\n- She supports the Commission's proposal but thinks it's insufficient.\n- She wants lower stocking densities (below 25 kg/m\u00b2).\n- She suggests implementing a point system for footpad lesions, which are a welfare issue.\n\nNow, I need to structure this into the required JSON fields. The issueSum should mention the key issue she raised, which is stocking density and welfare standards. Her position is that the current proposal is too low and needs stricter measures. The arguments she used are probably based on animal welfare concerns, though the summary doesn't explicitly state her reasoning. The proposals she made are the lower density and the point system.\n\nWait, the user said to only include points attributed to the speaker. The summary doesn't mention her justifying her arguments, so argSum might be empty. But the example includes an argument. However, in the given debate summary, Westlund's arguments are not detailed beyond her positions. So maybe the argSum is not present. But the example has \"His support for strict limitations... is based on...\" So maybe I need to infer if there's a reason given. The summary says she \"argued that 'the [proposed] level is too low on animal welfare.' She called for densities below 25 kg/m\u00b2...\" So her argument is that the current level is too low, but the summary doesn't specify why. So perhaps the argSum is just that she found the level too low, but without further reasoning. Maybe the argSum would be \"She argued that the proposed level is too low for animal welfare, necessitating stricter measures.\"\n\nBut the user's example has \"based on a need to prevent improper use,\" which is a reason. In this case, the debate summary doesn't give her reasoning, just her position. So maybe the argSum is empty. However, the user's instruction says to include arguments used to justify positions. Since the summary doesn't provide her justification, perhaps there's nothing to include. But the example includes an argument even if it's brief.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fact that she called for lower densities because of welfare issues is the argument. So, the argSum could be \"She argued that lower stocking densities and a point system for footpad lesions are necessary to improve animal welfare.\"\n\nBut the user's example has \"based on a need to prevent improper use,\" which is a direct reason. In this case, the summary says she \"argued that the [proposed] level is too low on animal welfare.\" So the argument is that the current level is insufficient for welfare. So the argSum would be \"She argued that the proposed level is too low for animal welfare, necessitating stricter measures.\"\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nissueSum: Stocking density and welfare standards for broiler chickens.\npositionSum: She supported the Commission's proposal but argued it's too low, advocating for densities below 25 kg/m\u00b2 and a point system for footpad lesions.\nargSum: She argued that the proposed level is too low for animal welfare, necessitating stricter measures.\npropSum: She called for densities below 25 kg/m\u00b2 and a point system for footpad lesions.\n\nI need to make sure not to include other speakers' points. The user's example has \"He supports...\" so I need to use \"She\" here. Also, check for any other points. The summary mentions she \"welcomed the Commission\u2019s proposal as an improvement\" but that's part of her position. So the positionSum should include that she thinks it's an improvement but needs more. The propSum is the specific proposals: lower density and point system.\n\nSo the JSON should be:\n\n{\n  \"issueSum\": \"Stocking density and welfare standards for broiler chickens\",\n  \"positionSum\": \"She welcomed the Commission\u2019s proposal as an improvement but argued that the proposed level is too low on animal welfare, advocating for densities below 25 kg/m\u00b2 and a point system for footpad lesions.\",\n  \"argSum\": \"She argued that the proposed level is too low for animal welfare, necessitating stricter measures.\",\n  \"propSum\": \"She called for densities below 25 kg/m\u00b2 and a point system for footpad lesions.\"\n}\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"Stocking density and welfare standards for broiler chickens\",\n\"positionSum\": \"She welcomed the Commission\u2019s proposal as an improvement but argued that the proposed level is too low on animal welfare, advocating for densities below 25 kg/m\u00b2 and a point system for footpad lesions.\",\n\"argSum\": \"She argued that the proposed level is too low for animal welfare, necessitating stricter measures.\",\n\"propSum\": \"She called for densities below 25 kg/m\u00b2 and a point system for footpad lesions.\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "gpt-4.1", "generator_model_type": "gpt", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "gpt"}, {"speaker": "Mar\u00eda Esther Herranz Garc\u00eda,", "english": "Mar\u00eda Esther Herranz Garc\u00eda, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . \u2013 (ES) Madam President, I must congratulate Mr Berman and thank him for his work, because his political position has been very constructive and realistic and has enabled us to reach an agreement amongst the different positions expressed by Members.\nThis draft report, adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on this new directive on the protection of chickens kept for meat production, is balanced, because it takes account of the production practices of the majority of Member States.\nThe key point of this report is densities, as you know.

Scanning through the sections, under the \"Balanced or Cautiously Progressive Approaches\" section, there's a mention of her. She supported the \"balanced position\" from the Agriculture Committee, found the density \"reasonable for most regions,\" and argued that amendments for stricter limits would create unnecessary adaptation challenges.\n\nNow, the task is to extract her key points. The user wants only the arguments attributed to her. The issueSum should mention her stance on stocking density. The positionSum would be her support for the Agriculture Committee's balanced approach. The argSum would be her reasoning about unnecessary adaptation challenges. The propSum might not have specific proposals, but maybe her support for the committee's position.\n\nWait, the example response includes \"propSum\" even if there's no explicit proposal. But in her case, she didn't propose new policies, just supported the existing committee's position. So propSum might be empty. But the example shows that even if there's no proposal, it's included. However, the user's instruction says if there's no points, return an empty string. So I need to check if she made any proposals.\n\nLooking back, she \"supported the 'balanced position' from the Agriculture Committee\" and argued against stricter limits. So her position is against stricter amendments. The arguments are that stricter limits would create adaptation challenges. There's no specific proposal mentioned, just her position against certain amendments. So propSum might be empty. But the example includes \"He advocates strict limitations...\" even if it's a position. Wait, in the example, \"propSum\" is a proposal. So maybe in this case, since she didn't propose anything new, propSum is an empty string.\n\nSo structuring the JSON:\n\nissueSum: The key issue is stocking density and adaptation challenges.\n\npositionSum: Supported the balanced position from the Agriculture Committee, found density reasonable, opposed stricter limits.\n\nargSum: Argued that stricter limits would create unnecessary adaptation challenges.\n\npropSum: No specific proposals mentioned, so empty.\n\nI need to make sure not to include other speakers' points.

It must be pointed out that one criterion was emphasised above all others, that of stocking density. We should condemn the Commission proposal for recommending the automatic registration of certain data, something that seems difficult for small producers to contemplate and to write off as part of their costs. Let us return, however, to stocking density, which is the main criterion at stake.\nAn initial economic approach in Wallonia shows that, on the basis of average revenue of 72 cents per kilo, the estimated loss of annual revenue for a 1\u00a0000 square metre building would be 55% for a stocking density of 30 kg per square metre and 24% for a stocking density of 38 kg per square metre. The sector cannot absorb this estimated loss of revenue. The planned elimination of countless producers in Europe and a stagnant or rising consumer demand will inevitably benefit imports from countries that are a long way away from applying our standards, or even from considering them. Animal welfare will be the loser throughout.\nWhile I am therefore responsive to the rapporteur\u2019s arguments aimed at moving European agriculture in the direction of sustainable agriculture, I should like, by way of conclusion, to underline two crucial elements. Firstly, moving in the direction of higher quality means that European producers will have an extra cost to bear. We should emphasise this difference and draw attention to it through the use of labels so as to put in practice, and explain the reason behind, a price differential that the Eurobarometer respondent \u2013 who is also a consumer \u2013 must be prepared to pay. Mass distribution has a key role to play in this regard.\nSecondly \u2013 and to conclude \u2013 it is crucial that we do everything in our power to ensure that the European Commission, with the help of international organisations such as the Council of Europe or the World Organisation for Animal Health, succeeds in making the WTO more compliant with the animal welfare measures.", "lang": "FR", "original": "Marc Tarabella, au nom du groupe PSE . - Madame la Pr\u00e9sidente, ce dossier participe \u00e0 la dynamique qui veut que l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne se singularise sur le plan du bien-\u00eatre animal par rapport \u00e0 ses concurrents.\nDans ce dossier, je tiens tout d\u2019abord \u00e0 saluer le rapporteur Thijs Berman qui a tent\u00e9 de trouver un \u00e9quilibre entre des positions par trop disparates. Force est de reconna\u00eetre que l\u2019accent a surtout \u00e9t\u00e9 mis sur un seul crit\u00e8re, celui de la densit\u00e9.

Cette perte de revenu estim\u00e9e est insupportable pour le secteur. La disparition programm\u00e9e de nombreux producteurs en Europe et une demande des consommateurs en stagnation ou en hausse vont n\u00e9cessairement profiter aux importations en provenance de pays qui sont loin d\u2019appliquer nos normes, voire de les envisager.

The key points here are their concerns about economic impacts. \n\nThe summary states that Tarabella and Tabajdi warned that reducing stocking density would reduce income and risk sector viability due to competition from non-EU imports.

His position is against stricter regulations because of these economic concerns.

Things may well already be different in practice. The Commission fails to take this into account in any way, and as the previous speaker said, we have not yet seen an economic analysis. It is easy to say that animal welfare must not take second place to socio-economic priorities, but some people still need to make a living out of this; what exactly are the consequences for them? Does the Commission have any idea?\nWhat matters most, of course, as has also been mentioned by many before me, including the Commissioner, although he did not manage to win me over completely, is a code of conduct. It is not very sensible, though, if we want to stress what are referred to as non-trade aspects, to table yet another fresh proposal in the middle of discussions in the World Trade Organisation, without knowing for certain that the importers comply. Why does the Commission not raise the subject of a code of conduct with the supermarkets and other large importers, and do so as soon as possible?\nWhere is the logic, if European producers are told that they need to meet such and such standards, while various supermarkets are allowed to import from the rest of the world with no restrictions, without the Commission demanding that checks of any kind be put in place?

The relevant part says: \"Carl Schlyter (Verts/ALE) and Jan Mulder pressed for stronger protections and aligned themselves with environmental committee proposals, warning that 'failure to act will undermine industry legitimacy' [Schlyter, date not specified].\"\n\nSo, Jan Mulder is associated with pressing for stronger protections and aligning with environmental committee proposals. The argument here is that failure to act would undermine industry legitimacy. However, the user's instruction is to only include points attributed to the specific speaker. The problem is that the summary doesn't provide more details about Jan Mulder's specific arguments beyond this mention. \n\nThe user wants the response in JSON format with issueSum, positionSum, argSum, propSum. But based on the given information, there's very limited data. The summary doesn't elaborate on Jan Mulder's specific points beyond aligning with environmental proposals and the warning about industry legitimacy. \n\nI need to check if there's any other mention of Jan Mulder. Scanning again, no other mentions. So the only info is that he pressed for stronger protections and aligned with environmental committee proposals, citing the risk to industry legitimacy. \n\nBut the user's example response includes more detailed points. However, in this case, the debate summary doesn't provide more. So the answer must be based solely on the given text. \n\nTherefore, the issueSum would relate to stronger protections for broiler chickens. PositionSum would be supporting stronger protections and aligning with environmental proposals. ArgSum is the warning about industry legitimacy. PropSum would be the call for stronger protections. However, the exact wording needs to be precise.\n\nBut the user's example has \"issueSum\" as a summary of key issues, \"positionSum\" as positions, etc. So, in this case:\n\nissueSum: The need for stronger protections for broiler chickens.\npositionSum: Supports stronger protections and aligns with environmental committee proposals.\nargSum: Failure to act would undermine industry legitimacy.\npropSum: Pressed for stronger protections.\n\nBut the user's example also includes specific quotes. However, the debate summary here doesn't have more details. So the answer must be based on the given text. \n\nBut the user's instruction says that if there are no points, return an empty string. However, there is a mention of Jan Mulder. So I need to structure the JSON accordingly. However, the exact phrasing needs to be accurate. \n\nSo the final JSON would have:\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The key issue raised by the speaker relates to the need for stronger protections for broiler chickens.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"The speaker supports stronger protections for broiler chickens and aligns with environmental committee proposals.\",\n\"argSum\": \"The speaker argues that failure to act will undermine industry legitimacy.\",\n\"propSum\": \"The speaker pressed for stronger protections for broiler chickens.\"\n}\n\nBut I need to check if the original text says \"pressed for stronger protections and aligned themselves with environmental committee proposals\".

The user provided a debate summary about broiler chicken welfare in the European Parliament, and they want me to focus on Jeffrey Titford's contributions.\n\nFirst, I need to check the debate summary to find any mentions of Jeffrey Titford. Scanning through the sections, under the \"Critiques of Overregulation\" part, Titford is mentioned. The summary says he and Jean-Claude Martinez criticized the proposals as bureaucratic overreach with unnecessary administrative burdens and disconnected from producer realities. Titford's exact quote is: \"We do not need a supranational bureaucratic dictatorship to tell us how to look after our chickens.\"\n\nSo, the key points here are his opposition to the proposed regulations, viewing them as excessive bureaucracy, and his concern about the disconnect from actual producer needs. The user's instructions say to only include points attributed to the speaker, so I need to make sure not to include other speakers' arguments.\n\nNow, structuring the JSON response. The issueSum should mention his critique of overregulation. PositionSum would be his stance against the proposals. The argument is based on the idea that the regulations are bureaucratic and not practical. PropSum would be his call for avoiding such overreach.\n\nWait, the example response has specific fields. Let me make sure each part is correctly filled. The user also mentioned that if there are no points, return an empty string. But in this case, there are points from Titford.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nissueSum: Critique of overregulation and bureaucratic measures in the proposed welfare standards.\npositionSum: Opposed the proposals, arguing they are unnecessary bureaucratic overreach.\nargSum: Based on the idea that the regulations are disconnected from producer realities and create a supranational bureaucratic system.\npropSum: Advocated for strict limitations on government demands for private data (Wait, no, in the debate summary, Titford's point was about bureaucracy in animal welfare regulations, not data. The example response might have a different context. Wait, the user's example is about the Data Act, but in this case, the debate is about chicken welfare. So the propSum should be about his proposal to avoid overregulation. But the actual summary says he criticized the proposals as bureaucratic overreach. So the propSum would be his call to prevent such overreach. However, the example's propSum is a specific proposal. But in the debate summary, Titford's contribution is a critique, not a specific proposal. So maybe the propSum is his call for less regulation. But the exact wording in the summary is that he criticized the proposals as bureaucratic overreach. So the propSum would be \"advocates for strict limitations on government demands for private data\" in the example, but in this case, it's about avoiding unnecessary regulations. However, the user's example might not match exactly. Wait, the user's example is about the Data Act, but the current case is about chicken welfare. So the propSum here should be his proposal, which is to not have the overregulation. But the actual text says he \"criticized the proposals as bureaucratic overreach with unnecessary administrative burdens and disconnected from producer realities.\" So the propSum would be \"advocates against unnecessary bureaucratic regulations in animal welfare standards.\"\n\nBut the user's example has \"propSum\": \"He advocates for strict limitations on government demands for private data\". So in this case, the propSum should be similar, but related to the debate. Since Titford's contribution is a critique, his proposal is to avoid the proposed regulations, so the propSum would be \"calls for avoiding unnecessary bureaucratic regulations in animal welfare standards.\"\n\nBut the user's instructions say to outline the main points or arguments made by the speaker. So the propSum is about proposals or policy actions. However, in the debate summary, Titford's contribution is a critique, not a specific proposal. So maybe the propSum is empty. But the example includes a propSum even if it's a call to action. Hmm.\n\nLooking back at the user's example, the propSum is \"advocates for strict limitations on government demands for private data\", which is a proposal. In the case of Titford, his argument is against the regulations, so his proposal would be to not implement them, but the exact wording in the summary is that he criticized the proposals. So perhaps the propSum is \"calls for reducing bureaucratic regulations in animal welfare policies\" or something similar.\n\nBut the user's example might have a different structure. Since the user's example includes a propSum even if it's a call to action, I should structure it similarly. So, based on Titford's contribution, the propSum would be his call to avoid the overregulation. So:\n\n\"propSum\": \"Advocates against unnecessary bureaucratic regulations in animal welfare standards\"\n\nBut the exact wording in the summary is that he criticized the proposals as bureaucratic overreach. So the propSum would be his proposal to avoid such regulations. Therefore, the JSON should reflect that.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"Criticism of proposed regulations as bureaucratic overreach and unnecessary administrative burdens.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"Opposed the proposals, arguing they are excessive and disconnected from producer realities.\",\n\"argSum\": \"Believed the regulations would create a supranational bureaucratic system that undermines practical farming needs.\",\n\"propSum\": \"Advocated for limiting government intervention in animal welfare standards to avoid unnecessary bureaucracy.\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "gpt-4.1", "generator_model_type": "gpt", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "gpt"}, {"speaker": "Janusz Wojciechowski,", "english": "Janusz Wojciechowski, on behalf of the UEN Group . \u2013 (PL )\u00a0Madam President, the regulation we are debating today lays down high standards for the rearing of broiler chickens and their welfare.

Many a time in this very Chamber have I denounced the disgraceful industrial farms, in which up to 80\u00a0million male chicks have been burnt alive to heat up the farms. I have denounced the way in which the chickens are slaughtered using electric stunning techniques. In fact, the chickens are not completely stunned, with the result that they are plunged into hot water while they are still alive: they are boiled so that they can be plucked.\nWe therefore all agree that rules are needed. However, when European farmers read the directive, what do they see? They see that the broiler chicken is subjected to two daily medical visits, which are carried out by a veterinary surgeon who must be at least three metres away from the chicken; the area in which the chickens are kept must be illuminated by a non-flickering light with an intensity of 50 lux, 20 lux or 100 lux \u2013 no one quite knows \u2013 measured at bird eye level; the inside temperature of the farm must not exceed the outside temperature measured in the shade by more than 3\u02daC; the chicken\u2019s litter must be 5 cm deep; certificates are required for the purposes of keeping chickens and of castrating chicks that are less than ten days\u2019 old; the chickens\u2019 foot pads must be examined, and the stocking density of the chickens must be limited to 28, 30, 35 or 42 kilograms per square metre, although it is not specified whether this means one kilo liveweight or metabolic weight.\nMeanwhile, thousands of chickens are being slaughtered in Nigeria, and avian influenza is going to strike down 1.1\u00a0billion African chickens. All of this because we did not find the EUR\u00a0800\u00a0million that would have made it possible to administer to each African chicken the two necessary vaccines, at a cost of 40 cents per dose. I could also try to add a touch of black humour here. Faced with this deluge of precautions that are reserved for white chickens while black children are dying of leprosy, AIDS and tuberculosis, the little African child is going to end up saying: \u2018when I grow up, I am not going to be a fireman, I am going to be a broiler chicken in Europe!\nIn the meantime, our Breton farms, for example, are relocating to Brazil \u2013 the leader in poultry farming \u2013 where not only are the chickens unprotected, but the children are too. The latter are treated like slaves so that the Brazilian farms can be kept in operation, and that is without mentioning the banana plantations, in which little eight-year-olds fall asleep exhausted on cardboard boxes and come into contact with plant-care products that make them dizzy, all for just USD 2 a day. Well, everyone has his or her own idea of what is most important. Some people choose white chickens whereas I, for my part, choose African children and Asian children.

The user provided a detailed debate summary about broiler chicken welfare in the European Parliament and wants the response for Jean-Claude Martinez. The instructions say to only include points from the specified speaker.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the debate summary and find any mentions of Jean-Claude Martinez. Scanning through the sections, there's a part under \"Critiques of Overregulation\" where he's mentioned. The key quote is: \"Jean-Claude Martinez highlighted the irrational proportion of 'bureaucratic detail' and contrasted animal-focused regulation with the neglect of urgent global human crises [Martinez, date not specified].\"\n\nSo, the main points here are his critique of overregulation, specifically the excessive bureaucratic details, and his argument that resources are misallocated by focusing on animal welfare while ignoring bigger human issues. \n\nNow, structuring this into the required JSON fields. \n\n\"issueSum\" should mention his concern about bureaucratic overreach and the balance between animal welfare and human crises. \n\n\"positionSum\" would state his position against excessive regulation, emphasizing the need to address global human issues instead. \n\n\"argSum\" would be the reasoning he provided, which is the irrational proportion of bureaucracy and the neglect of human crises. \n\n\"propSum\" isn't directly mentioned, but since he's critiquing, maybe there's no specific proposal. The example response includes propSum even if it's a critique, so perhaps stating his advocacy for reducing bureaucratic demands. \n\nWait, the user's example for propSum includes a proposal even if it's a critique. So in this case, since he's against overregulation, his proposal might be to limit bureaucratic measures. But the original text doesn't mention a specific proposal, just his critique. So maybe propSum is empty? But the example includes it. Let me check the instructions again. \n\nThe user says: \"If this is the case, respond with an empty string.\" So if there's no proposal, leave it empty. But in the example, even though the speaker is critiquing, the propSum is \"He advocates for strict limitations on government demands for private data\". So maybe even if it's a critique, if it's a proposal, include it. \n\nIn Martinez's case, his argument is against excessive bureaucracy, so his proposal would be to avoid such overregulation. But the original text doesn't explicitly state a proposal, just his critique. So perhaps propSum is empty. But the example includes it. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"propSum\" is about policy actions. Since he's criticizing, maybe there's no proposal. So I should check if there's any mention of his proposals. The original text only has his critique, not a specific proposal. So propSum would be an empty string. \n\nBut the example includes \"He advocates for strict limitations...\" even though it's part of his argument. So maybe in this case, the propSum is his advocacy against overregulation. But the exact wording in the debate summary is that he \"highlighted the irrational proportion of 'bureaucratic detail' and contrasted animal-focused regulation with the neglect of urgent global human crises.\" So his position is against excessive regulation, but the propSum would be his call for limiting bureaucratic measures. \n\nTherefore, the JSON should reflect that. So:\n\nissueSum: \"Concerns about bureaucratic overreach and the imbalance between animal welfare regulations and global human crises.\"\npositionSum: \"Opposed to excessive regulatory measures, arguing that focus on animal welfare diverts attention from more pressing global human issues.\"\nargSum: \"Argued that the regulatory focus on animal welfare is disproportionate and neglects urgent global human crises.\"\npropSum: \"Advocated for reducing bureaucratic regulatory demands to address more critical global issues.\"\n\nBut I need to make sure it's based on the provided text. The exact quote is about the \"irrational proportion of 'bureaucratic detail'\" and \"neglect of urgent global human crises.\" So the arguments are about the proportionality and the misallocation of focus. \n\nSo finalizing the JSON accordingly.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"Criticism of excessive regulatory measures and the imbalance between animal welfare regulations and global human crises.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"Opposed to overregulation, arguing that focus on animal welfare diverts attention from more pressing global human issues.\",\n\"argSum\": \"Argued that the regulatory focus on animal welfare is disproportionate and neglects urgent global human crises.\",\n\"propSum\": \"Advocated for reducing bureaucratic regulatory demands to address more critical global issues.\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "gpt-4.1", "generator_model_type": "gpt", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "gpt"}, {"speaker": "Elisabeth Jeggle (PPE-DE). \u2013", "english": "Elisabeth Jeggle (PPE-DE). \u2013 (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to start with very warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Berman, for the work he has done.

If standards are raised within the Community, they will in particular face the problem of imports from third states, where standards in production are far inferior to our own. I therefore call for the introduction of binding rules on labelling, founded upon compliance with standards of protection, which will be effective, binding and harmonised right across Europe.\nSecondly, I call for certain standards in the keeping and production of broiler chickens and other agricultural products to be demanded in future WTO negotiations. The EU\u2019s high standard in food production should become an advantage for producers in the EU.

I believe that that is something on which we have all agreed during this debate.\nIn producing this legislation, however, we must keep our feet on the ground. We must produce a viable and credible proposal, not restrict ourselves to making pointless gestures, which give the impression of being inconsistent with the Council\u2019s current figures.\nI therefore believe that the report by the rapporteur, Mr\u00a0Berman, whom I congratulate, combines a genuine concern for the welfare of animals, taking account of scientific data at all times, with the necessary flexibility in its application to make it possible for producers to accept the measures proposed and adapt to them. On the one hand, measures are proposed to prevent the practices that lead to pointless and gratuitous suffering for the animal, and, on the most hotly debated and controversial point \u2014 stocking density \u2014 credible and applicable figures are laid down that represent significant progress in this field and which are acceptable to the Council.

The quote says they pressed for stronger protections and aligned with environmental committee proposals, warning that \"failure to act will undermine industry legitimacy.\"\n\nSo, the key issue here is the need for stronger animal welfare protections.

One could say that we do not make that mistake in the World Trade Organisation and that although Europe tries its hardest, more should be done. We can come to an agreement with regard to imports and import quotas. We can also do a deal with regard to labelling.

The CDA prefers this way of working, because otherwise we will produce yet more European legislation, which consumers may applaud well as citizens, but in respect of which they will display different purchase behaviour the minute they walk into a supermarket.\nIt is essential that what the public want is also translated into consumer behaviour. That is the very reason we are very critical of this report. We will be voting in favour of Amendment 42, by means of which something will at least be done about imports, and we will also support everything in this report that is related to improved recognisability through meat labelling.\nAs long as there are no guarantees, though, that imports can be subjected to the same criteria, as long as we are once again putting the European farmer on the back foot and are again making things more difficult for animal welfare in Europe, it will be extremely difficult for us to vote in favour of this report.", "lang": "NL", "original": "Albert Jan Maat (PPE-DE). \u2013 Voorzitter, ook ik wil de rapporteur mijn complimenten maken voor de zorgvuldige wijze waarop hij zijn arbeid heeft verricht.\nLaat ik duidelijk zijn, het CDA is v\u00f3\u00f3r dierenwelzijn en vindt dit een belangrijk punt.

A few months ago no one would have questioned this statement.

Animal welfare aspects should indeed be taken into consideration. But we should not overshoot the target by imposing unrealistically strict regulations which force our farmers into a severe competitive disadvantage, endangering their livelihood. These people do not intend to be cruel to their animals \u2013 they just want to earn a living by doing what they are good at. Therefore, excessively strict regulations are unacceptable. Additionally, the planned excessive restrictions may lead to serious tension on internal markets, as well, because non-EU countries such as Brazil, which do not have to comply with these strict regulations, are able to sell their poultry products on European Union markets at significantly lower prices. The majority of average consumers, at least in the new Member States, choose the cheaper product, because their income does not allow them to pay a higher price for basic food, just because they are environmentally aware or care about animal welfare. In view of the professional, economic and animal welfare considerations, the acceptable stocking density would be 34 kilograms of live weight per square metre, with a maximum upper limit of 42 kilograms of live weight per square metre. Any figures included in the report that are lower than these are not acceptable.\nLet us trust in the expertise of poultry farmers, as none of them would be able to achieve good results with sick animals, which means that their primary interest is to conduct a rationalised economic activity, taking into account animal welfare considerations.

Tabajdi further warned that rigid rules might \"shift production to countries with lower welfare standards, harming animal welfare overall.\"\n\nSo the key points here are his economic concerns. The issue he raises is the economic impact of reducing stocking density. His position is against stricter welfare standards because of the economic risks. The argument is that reducing stocking density would lower income and make the sector less viable. His proposal is to avoid rigid rules that could lead to production shifts to countries with lower standards.\n\nNow, I need to structure this into the JSON format as specified.

The user provided a detailed debate summary about broiler chicken welfare in the European Parliament and wants the main points from James Nicholson (PPE-DE). \n\nFirst, I need to locate where Nicholson is mentioned.

The quote is: \"We are tying the hands of our producers\u2026while allowing others to flood our markets with food that does not meet our standards\" [Nicholson, date not specified].\n\nSo, the key points here are about protecting EU producers from unfair competition due to lower welfare standards in imports. Nicholson is concerned that without strict import controls, EU producers would be at a disadvantage. His argument is that if imports aren't held to the same standards, it's unfair to EU farmers. \n\nNow, I need to structure this into the required JSON format. The issueSum should mention import controls and fair competition. PositionSum would be his stance on enforcing EU standards on imports. The argument is about preventing unfair competition. PropSum would be his call for equal standards on imports.\n\nI need to make sure not to include other speakers' points. The user specified to only include Nicholson's arguments.

To look at the bigger picture, I say that this demonstrates our humanity towards all our fellow inhabitants of this planet.\nHowever, we must accept that, as has already been said, all this increases the cost of production in the European Union. On the other hand, of course, we allow chickens to come in from third countries; we allow everything to come in except weapons. In this way, we are causing European poultry farmers to close their poultry farms. This is unfortunate on two counts: both for the poultry farmers, a class for which we should show solidarity, and for the chickens, because we shall arrive at the point, in a few years' time, where chicken products will be imported from third countries which are produced without any protection as regards a decent life for the animals. Unless we want to be hypocrites, we must find a way of controlling the living conditions of chickens in third countries; otherwise we should not permit imports.\nLabelling, which Mr Kyprianou, referred to, is a very good idea, we think it is an excellent idea and we want to proceed towards this sector, but we also need to think about subsidising poultry farmers for the costs relating solely to the measures we impose on them.

The user provided a detailed debate summary about broiler chicken welfare in the European Parliament and wants me to focus on Ambroise Guellec's contributions.\n\nFirst, I need to find where Ambroise Guellec is mentioned. Scanning through the debate summary, under the \"Economic and Pragmatic Concerns\" section, there's a mention of him. The text says: \"Ambroise Guellec echoed prioritizing 'the well-being of [EU] farmers' and was skeptical about the 'adaptation and reconversion to higher quality production' [Guellec, date not specified].\"\n\nSo, the key points here are that Guellec prioritizes the well-being of EU farmers and is skeptical about the feasibility of adapting to higher welfare standards. The issue he raises is the economic impact on farmers. His position is that the focus should be on farmers' well-being, and he's doubtful about the ability of producers to adapt to higher standards. The argument here is probably about the practicality and economic viability for farmers. The proposal he might be making is to prioritize farmer well-being over stricter regulations.\n\nI need to make sure I don't include other speakers' points. The user specified that only Guellec's contributions should be included. The response should be in JSON format with the four fields: issueSum, positionSum, argSum, propSum. \n\nLet me structure each part. The issue is the economic impact on farmers. His position is prioritizing farmer well-being and skepticism towards adaptation. The argument is likely about the challenges farmers face in adapting.

The issueSum should capture the main issue he addressed, which is the need for EU-wide rules to ensure chicken welfare.
