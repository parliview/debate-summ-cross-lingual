{"speaker": "Marc Tarabella,", "english": "Marc Tarabella, on behalf of the PSE Group . \u2013 (FR) Madam\u00a0President, this matter is in keeping with the idea that the European Union should distinguish itself from its competitors in the area of animal welfare.\nIn this matter, I should like to begin by paying tribute to the rapporteur, Mr\u00a0Berman, who has tried to strike a balance between positions that were much too far apart. It must be pointed out that one criterion was emphasised above all others, that of stocking density. We should condemn the Commission proposal for recommending the automatic registration of certain data, something that seems difficult for small producers to contemplate and to write off as part of their costs. Let us return, however, to stocking density, which is the main criterion at stake.\nAn initial economic approach in Wallonia shows that, on the basis of average revenue of 72 cents per kilo, the estimated loss of annual revenue for a 1\u00a0000 square metre building would be 55% for a stocking density of 30 kg per square metre and 24% for a stocking density of 38 kg per square metre. The sector cannot absorb this estimated loss of revenue. The planned elimination of countless producers in Europe and a stagnant or rising consumer demand will inevitably benefit imports from countries that are a long way away from applying our standards, or even from considering them. Animal welfare will be the loser throughout.\nWhile I am therefore responsive to the rapporteur\u2019s arguments aimed at moving European agriculture in the direction of sustainable agriculture, I should like, by way of conclusion, to underline two crucial elements. Firstly, moving in the direction of higher quality means that European producers will have an extra cost to bear. We should emphasise this difference and draw attention to it through the use of labels so as to put in practice, and explain the reason behind, a price differential that the Eurobarometer respondent \u2013 who is also a consumer \u2013 must be prepared to pay. Mass distribution has a key role to play in this regard.\nSecondly \u2013 and to conclude \u2013 it is crucial that we do everything in our power to ensure that the European Commission, with the help of international organisations such as the Council of Europe or the World Organisation for Animal Health, succeeds in making the WTO more compliant with the animal welfare measures.", "lang": "FR", "original": "Marc Tarabella, au nom du groupe PSE . - Madame la Pr\u00e9sidente, ce dossier participe \u00e0 la dynamique qui veut que l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne se singularise sur le plan du bien-\u00eatre animal par rapport \u00e0 ses concurrents.\nDans ce dossier, je tiens tout d\u2019abord \u00e0 saluer le rapporteur Thijs Berman qui a tent\u00e9 de trouver un \u00e9quilibre entre des positions par trop disparates. Force est de reconna\u00eetre que l\u2019accent a surtout \u00e9t\u00e9 mis sur un seul crit\u00e8re, celui de la densit\u00e9. Il est \u00e0 bl\u00e2mer que la proposition de la Commission pr\u00e9conise l\u2019enregistrement automatique de certaines donn\u00e9es, ce qui para\u00eet difficile \u00e0 envisager et \u00e0 amortir par de petits producteurs. Mais revenons \u00e0 la densit\u00e9, crit\u00e8re de tous les enjeux.\nUne premi\u00e8re approche \u00e9conomique en r\u00e9gion wallonne montre que pour un b\u00e2timent de 1\u00a0000 m\u00e8tres carr\u00e9s, sur la base d\u2019un revenu moyen de 72 centimes d\u2019euros par kilo, la perte de revenus annuels serait estim\u00e9e \u00e0 55% pour une densit\u00e9 de 30\u00a0kg au m\u00e8tre carr\u00e9 et \u00e0 24% pour une densit\u00e9 de 38\u00a0kg au m\u00e8tre carr\u00e9. Cette perte de revenu estim\u00e9e est insupportable pour le secteur. La disparition programm\u00e9e de nombreux producteurs en Europe et une demande des consommateurs en stagnation ou en hausse vont n\u00e9cessairement profiter aux importations en provenance de pays qui sont loin d\u2019appliquer nos normes, voire de les envisager. Le bien-\u00eatre animal serait perdant sur toute la ligne.\nD\u00e8s lors, tout en \u00e9tant sensible aux arguments du rapporteur visant \u00e0 faire progresser l\u2019agriculture europ\u00e9enne vers une agriculture durable, je tiens, pour terminer, \u00e0 mettre en exergue deux \u00e9l\u00e9ments fondamentaux. Tout d\u2019abord, se diriger vers plus de qualit\u00e9 entra\u00eene un co\u00fbt suppl\u00e9mentaire pour les producteurs europ\u00e9ens. Il convient de labelliser et de mettre en valeur cette diff\u00e9rence de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 pratiquer et expliciter la raison d\u2019un prix diff\u00e9renci\u00e9 que doit \u00eatre pr\u00eat \u00e0 payer le r\u00e9pondant de l\u2019Eurobarom\u00e8tre qui est aussi consommateur. La grande distribution a un r\u00f4le d\u00e9terminant \u00e0 jouer \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\nDeuxi\u00e8mement, et pour finir, il est essentiel que nous fassions le maximum pour que la Commission europ\u00e9enne, avec l\u2019aide d\u2019organisations internationales telles que le Conseil de l\u2019Europe ou l\u2019Organisation mondiale de la sant\u00e9 animale, parvienne \u00e0 imposer une plus grande acceptation par l\u2019OMC des mesures relevant du bien-\u00eatre animal.", "agenda_item": "Protection of chickens kept for meat production (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060213-ITEM-011", "intervention_id": "1-088", "summary_english": "{\n  \"headline\": \"Balancing Animal Welfare and Economic Viability in EU Chicken Meat Production Standards\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"The speaker addresses the EU's approach to the protection of chickens kept for meat production, focusing primarily on the issue of stocking density as a critical criterion.
