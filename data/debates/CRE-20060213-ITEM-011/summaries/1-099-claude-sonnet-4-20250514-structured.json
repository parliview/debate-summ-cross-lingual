{"speaker": "Csaba S\u00e1ndor Tabajdi (PSE). \u2013", "english": "Csaba S\u00e1ndor Tabajdi (PSE). \u2013 (HU) Poultry breeding and rearing is the progressive, profitable sector of European livestock farming. A few months ago no one would have questioned this statement. Today however, poultry farmers are facing a new threat after the bird flu: the current regulation.\nThe current draft regulation, which has given more consideration to animal welfare than to industry sector and economic arguments, threatens the competitiveness of this sector. Animal welfare aspects should indeed be taken into consideration. But we should not overshoot the target by imposing unrealistically strict regulations which force our farmers into a severe competitive disadvantage, endangering their livelihood. These people do not intend to be cruel to their animals \u2013 they just want to earn a living by doing what they are good at. Therefore, excessively strict regulations are unacceptable. Additionally, the planned excessive restrictions may lead to serious tension on internal markets, as well, because non-EU countries such as Brazil, which do not have to comply with these strict regulations, are able to sell their poultry products on European Union markets at significantly lower prices. The majority of average consumers, at least in the new Member States, choose the cheaper product, because their income does not allow them to pay a higher price for basic food, just because they are environmentally aware or care about animal welfare. In view of the professional, economic and animal welfare considerations, the acceptable stocking density would be 34 kilograms of live weight per square metre, with a maximum upper limit of 42 kilograms of live weight per square metre. Any figures included in the report that are lower than these are not acceptable.\nLet us trust in the expertise of poultry farmers, as none of them would be able to achieve good results with sick animals, which means that their primary interest is to conduct a rationalised economic activity, taking into account animal welfare considerations. Let us not make their task so difficult that they may be forced to give up poultry breeding altogether!", "lang": "HU", "original": "Csaba S\u00e1ndor Tabajdi (PSE). \u2013 A baromfiteny\u00e9szt\u00e9s \u00e9s -nevel\u00e9s a progressz\u00edv j\u00f6vedelmez\u0151 \u00e1gazata az eur\u00f3pai \u00e1llatteny\u00e9szt\u00e9snek.
