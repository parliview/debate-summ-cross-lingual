{"speaker": "Janusz Wojciechowski,", "english": "Janusz Wojciechowski, on behalf of the UEN Group . \u2013 (PL )\u00a0Madam President, the regulation we are debating today lays down high standards for the rearing of broiler chickens and their welfare. These standards are needed. Within the European Union we should be striving to ensure that animals are treated as humanely as possible. This applies especially to animals raised for meat production, such as broiler chickens.\nWe should spare animals unnecessary suffering to ensure humane treatment and out of regard for the standards of our civilisation. We should do so in the interests of our own health too. There is a large body of research showing that meat from animals raised in poor conditions and subjected to constant stress is simply less healthy. However, a problem of a rather different nature has arisen. The regulation imposes high standards on European Union broiler producers, but it does not apply to importers. Maintaining high standards is expensive, which means that our producers\u2019 meat cannot compete with meat from producers outside the Union. They are exporting to the European market meat from poultry raised in countries where such high standards are not guaranteed. Many European broiler producers are threatened with bankruptcy, because they have become less competitive due to the fact that they have to meet high European Union standards.\nThe same standards should be imposed on imports as on meat produced within the Union, not only for the sake of the broiler chickens but also for the benefit of their producers and especially for the good of the consumers. The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development adopted an amendment tabled by the Union for the Europe of the Nations Group calling on the European Commission to ensure that these high standards are also met in the case of imported meat.\nI believe this should be a general principle that should apply not only to poultry but to all agricultural products.
