Some 5 billion broiler chickens are slaughtered in the European Union every year, and the great challenge presented by this report is that of finding a balance between the protection of animals, which is necessary, and the protection of jobs in the commercial production of broiler chickens.\nThere is no doubt \u2013 not least in the minds of those who breed and keep chickens for fattening \u2013 about the rightness of our making a joint proposal for the improvement and harmonisation of the conditions under which they are kept in the EU.\nI, too, endorse the report, but the producers operate, even today, with the tightest of profit margins. If standards are raised within the Community, they will in particular face the problem of imports from third states, where standards in production are far inferior to our own. I therefore call for the introduction of binding rules on labelling, founded upon compliance with standards of protection, which will be effective, binding and harmonised right across Europe.\nSecondly, I call for certain standards in the keeping and production of broiler chickens and other agricultural products to be demanded in future WTO negotiations. The EU\u2019s high standard in food production should become an advantage for producers in the EU. While we want our animals to be protected, we cannot, at the same time, allow our producers to be put in a disadvantaged position.\nThe current threat of bird flu is another reminder to us of how important it is that broiler chickens should be produced safely, in adequate quantities and on a sound economic basis.", "lang": "DE", "original": "Elisabeth Jeggle (PPE-DE). \u2013 Frau Pr\u00e4sidentin, Herr Kommissar, verehrte Kolleginnen und Kollegen! Auch ich m\u00f6chte zuerst dem Berichterstatter Herrn Berman sehr herzlich f\u00fcr seine Arbeit danken. In der Europ\u00e4ischen Union werden j\u00e4hrlich rund 5 Milliarden Masth\u00e4hnchen geschlachtet. Die gro\u00dfe Herausforderung dieses Berichts ist es, die Balance zwischen dem notwendigen Tierschutz und dem Erhalt von Arbeitspl\u00e4tzen in einer wirtschaftlichen Produktion von Masth\u00e4hnchen zu finden.\nOhne Zweifel ist es richtig, wenn wir mit einem gemeinsamen Vorschlag die Haltungsbedingungen f\u00fcr Masth\u00fchner in der EU verbessern und angleichen. Dies ist auch bei Z\u00fcchtern und Haltern unstrittig.\nAuch ich unterst\u00fctze den Bericht, aber die Erzeuger haben heute schon geringste Gewinnspannen. Bei h\u00f6heren innergemeinschaftlichen Standards stellt sich insbesondere das Problem der Importe aus Drittstaaten, die weit unter unserem Standard produzieren. Deswegen fordere ich die Einf\u00fchrung einer europaweit harmonisierten, aussagekr\u00e4ftigen und verbindlichen Etikettierungsregelung, die auf der Einhaltung von Schutznormen beruht.\nIch fordere zweitens, dass bei k\u00fcnftigen WTO-Verhandlungen bestimmte Standards bei Haltung und Produktion von Masth\u00fchnern und auch anderen landwirtschaftlichen Produkten eingefordert werden. Der hohe EU-Standard in der Nahrungsmittelproduktion soll zum Vorteil f\u00fcr die Produzenten in der EU werden. Wir wollen Tierschutz; wir d\u00fcrfen es dabei aber nicht zulassen, dass unsere Produzenten benachteiligt werden.\nAuch die aktuelle Bedrohung durch die Vogelgrippe sagt uns, dass wir Wert auf sichere, ausreichende und wirtschaftliche Masth\u00e4hnchenproduktion in Europa legen m\u00fcssen.", "agenda_item": "Protection of chickens kept for meat production (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060213-ITEM-011", "intervention_id": "1-095", "summary_english": "{\n\"headline\": \"Balancing Animal Welfare and Producer Competitiveness in Broiler Chicken Production\",\n\"issueSum\": \"The speaker addresses the need to harmonize and improve conditions for broiler chickens in the EU, balancing animal welfare with the economic realities faced by producers.
