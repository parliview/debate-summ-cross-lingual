{"speaker": "Carl Schlyter (Verts/ALE). \u2013", "english": "Carl Schlyter (Verts/ALE). \u2013 (SV) Madam President, no other animals suffer as much as broiler chickens. It is they that have far and away the worst experience at present. They are bred in such a way that they grow extremely large and, as a result, as many as a fifth of them have injuries to their joints. Separated from their mothers at birth, accommodated in cramped conditions and placed under stress, they suffer throughout their short lives.\nMr\u00a0Berman has tried to find a good balance of measures, but the Committee on Agriculture unfortunately has a bias towards short-term interests. This must be corrected by means of the proposals by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. Better conditions are required both by our consumers and in the interests of animal health. I would thank Mr\u00a0J\u00f8rgensen and others for their constructive cooperation.\nAccording to Eurobarometer, the individual animal protection issue that most Europeans want to grapple with is precisely that of improving the conditions of broiler chickens. Today, Parliament must listen to their voices. Vote, therefore, in favour of the proposals by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and in favour of the proposals put forward by Mr\u00a0J\u00f8rgensen and the rest of us in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
