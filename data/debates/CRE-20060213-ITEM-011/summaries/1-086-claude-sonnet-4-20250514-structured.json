{"speaker": "\u00c5sa Westlund (PSE),", "english": "\u00c5sa Westlund (PSE), draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. \u2013 (SV) Madam President, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety obviously welcomes the Commission\u2019s proposal on common rules governing chickens kept for meat production, particularly because the proposal involves clear improvements to animal protection but also because we aim to promote an efficient internal market.\nThe big problem with the Commission\u2019s proposal is that it does not do enough in terms of animal protection. According to the conclusions drawn by the Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare and on which our decision is based, stocking density must, for example, be lower than 25 kg if major injuries and unnecessary suffering are to be avoided. In line with this, many Members have tabled amendments precisely on the subjects of stocking density and the scoring system for foot pad lesions. These changes are necessary if we are to guarantee animal protection.\nWe in the European Parliament must take expert opinion seriously and show the Council that we want to see the Commission\u2019s proposal tightened up when it comes to animal protection. That, and not perhaps the details of our amendments, is what is most important right now. I therefore hope that, tomorrow, a majority of this Parliament will vote in favour of these amendments which, as I say, obtained considerable support in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
