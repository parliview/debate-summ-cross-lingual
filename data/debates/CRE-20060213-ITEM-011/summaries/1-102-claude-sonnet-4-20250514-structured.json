The reason given was that they could no longer compete with cheap imports from Asia and South America.\nI happen to believe that there is no such thing as cheap food. If food is cheap, it is not meeting the standards. Therefore I have to ask myself: is the chicken meat produced to our existing standards, never mind the proposed increased standards?\nI support the part of the report that states, in Amendment\u00a017, that we must insist on the same standards in third countries as in the European Union. At the moment we only pay lip service to this. We are tying the hands of our producers, our farmers, with bureaucracy and red tape, while allowing others to flood our markets with food that does not meet our standards.\nThis goes beyond the poultry industry: it is in the pig industry and in the red meat industry as well. They all have the same problem. I welcome higher standards, but I want the same everywhere. We must give consumers the choice. We must have proper food labelling; it must be clear, so that wherever consumers shop they can make a clear choice about what they wish to buy. They must know where the food came from. In many instances the supermarkets in the European Union are worsening standards by forcing down food prices.

A poultry plant in Northern Ireland recently closed with over 400 job losses due to this competition. The issue extends beyond poultry to pig and red meat industries, with EU producers constrained by bureaucracy while imports flood markets without meeting the same standards.\",\n  \"positionSum\": \"The speaker supports higher animal welfare standards for chicken production but insists these same standards must apply to imports from third countries. He advocates for proper food labeling so consumers can make informed choices about food origins and standards. He rejects the concept of 'cheap food,' arguing that low prices indicate substandard production that doesn't meet proper welfare and safety standards.\",\n  \"argSum\": \"His argument centers on the principle that 'there is no such thing as cheap food' - if food is cheap, it doesn't meet proper standards. He contends that current policy only pays 'lip service' to requiring third countries to meet EU standards while burdening domestic producers with bureaucracy and red tape. This creates unfair competition that forces plant closures and job losses.\",\n  \"propSum\": \"He proposes implementing Amendment 17 requiring the same standards in third countries as in the EU, establishing proper food labeling that clearly indicates food origins so consumers can make informed choices, and ensuring equal application of standards rather than just imposing bureaucracy on domestic producers while allowing substandard imports.\",\n  \"quotes\": [\n    \"I happen to believe that there is no such thing as cheap food.
