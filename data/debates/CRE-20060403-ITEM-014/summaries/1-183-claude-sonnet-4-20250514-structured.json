{"speaker": "Margrete Auken (Verts/ALE). \u2013", "english": "Margrete Auken (Verts/ALE). \u2013 (DA) Mr\u00a0President, I should like to thank the rapporteur for an excellent report that lays down important principles. The first of these is that there is no alternative to the multilateral trading system. Bilateral agreements always benefit the stronger party. We must focus on the developing countries, which benefit most from straightforward multilateral systems that allow them to free themselves from dependency on the colonial powers. Secondly, the report states that the EU must show leadership. This means that we in the EU must necessarily accept that we are going to pay for the agreements. We must get away from the quid-pro-quo principle and not focus on what we in the EU can get out of agreements in the short term. Agreements that combat global poverty are of most benefit to us too.\nThen there is agriculture. The decision to phase out export subsidies is all well and good, but we must also look at the rest of the subsidy arrangements, including subsidies for rural districts. According to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), such arrangements are very problematic for the world\u2019s poor. Finally, I want to say how gratifying it is that the report alludes to the ILO and environmental standards, even though it does so in unduly broad terms.", "lang": "DA", "original": "Margrete Auken (Verts/ALE). - Hr. formand Tak til ordf\u00f8reren for en udm\u00e6rket bet\u00e6nkning, der sl\u00e5r vigtige principper fast. For det f\u00f8rste at der ikke er noget alternativ til det multilaterale handelssystem. Bilaterale aftaler gavner altid den st\u00e6rke part. Vi skal fokusere p\u00e5 ulandene, og de f\u00e5r mest ud af klare multilaterale systemer, s\u00e5 de kan g\u00f8re sig fri af afh\u00e6ngigheden af kolonimagterne. For det andet sl\u00e5s det fast, at EU skal udvise lederskab. Det betyder, at EU n\u00f8dvendigvis m\u00e5 acceptere, at vi kommer til at betale for aftalerne. Vi skal v\u00e6k fra noget-for-noget-princippet og ikke fokusere p\u00e5, hvad vi i EU kan f\u00e5 ud af aftaler p\u00e5 kort sigt. Aftaler, der bek\u00e6mper global fattigdom, gavner ogs\u00e5 os mest.\nS\u00e5 er der landbruget. Det er fint med beslutningen om at afvikle eksportsubsidierne, men vi m\u00e5 ogs\u00e5 se p\u00e5 resten af st\u00f8tteordningerne, og herunder landdistriktst\u00f8tten, som if\u00f8lge UNDP er meget problematisk for verdens fattigste. Og endelig vil jeg sige, at det er gl\u00e6deligt, at vi har f\u00e5et ILO og milj\u00f8standarderne med i rapporten, selv om det er sket i alt for brede vendinger.", "agenda_item": "WTO Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060403-ITEM-014", "intervention_id": "1-183", "summary_english": "{\n\"headline\": \"EU Must Lead on Multilateral Trade by Accepting Costs and Phasing Out Agricultural Subsidies to Help Developing Countries\",\n\"issueSum\": \"The speaker addresses key issues for the WTO Ministerial Conference including the need for multilateral trading systems over bilateral agreements, EU leadership responsibilities, agricultural subsidy reform, and the inclusion of labor and environmental standards in trade policy.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"The speaker strongly supports multilateral trading systems as superior to bilateral agreements, advocates for EU leadership even if costly, supports phasing out export subsidies and broader agricultural subsidy arrangements, and welcomes the inclusion of ILO and environmental standards in trade policy.\",\n\"argSum\": \"The speaker argues that bilateral agreements always favor stronger parties while multilateral systems help developing countries escape colonial dependency.
