{"speaker": "Margot Wallstr\u00f6m,", "english": "Margot Wallstr\u00f6m, Vice-President of the Commission . Mr President, I shall make just three short comments. Firstly, I would like to thank you for this debate, which I found very constructive and balanced and indeed very interesting. Thank you for not shooting the messenger! I will indeed make sure that everything that has been said tonight is immediately forwarded to Mr Mandelson, who will also appreciate, I believe, that I did not go into depth on all the details of this Doha Round.\nI would also like to comment on the overall process. As you will understand, this is being regularly reported and discussed in the Commission. As several Members asked, what happens if Doha fails and what should we then say about the overall process? It is true that this process is not easy, but it is not blocked either, and we are still committed to concluding the round by the end of the year and to the principle of the single undertaking.\nAs has been mentioned, we have proposed real cuts in agricultural tariffs, but they must be matched by real cuts in industrial tariffs and services liberalisation. We have a few weeks left before the end of April and we will continue to discuss with our partners, step by step, so as to agree on the arrangements within the deadline that we set ourselves in Hong Kong.\nI would also like to say a few words about MEPs\u2019 participation in the next WTO meeting, because I think this is very important to all of you. As far as I understand it, the April meeting of the WTO is likely to be a General Council meeting in charge of negotiating procedures; it is not a ministerial as such, so it is not the same set-up and therefore the Commission does not foresee a fully-fledged official EU delegation such as that which we usually send to ministerial meetings like Hong Kong. If the INTA Committee here in Parliament sends MEPs to Geneva during that meeting, the Commissioner will be ready to meet them and provide a debriefing as usual. The Commission delegation in Geneva will also provide the support we usually offer to MEPs on the ground when they are on official business abroad. That is what we can say for today about MEPs\u2019 participation.\nAgain I thank you for the discussion and I will make sure that your views are immediately forwarded to Mr Mandelson and to the Commission as a whole.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Margot Wallstr\u00f6m, Vice-President of the Commission .
