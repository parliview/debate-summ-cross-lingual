{"speaker": "Jean-Claude Martinez (NI). \u2013", "english": "Jean-Claude Martinez (NI). \u2013 (FR) Mr\u00a0President, Commissioner, everyone in this Chamber is in favour of free trade; no one wants to re-create the Albania of Enver Hoxha\u2019s time. We are therefore all in favour of multilateral rules, but which rules, and to benefit whom?\nWe are told that free trade benefits employment and growth. Yet, have the rules applied to trade until now made nations wealthy? Here is the answer: in Mexico, 94 free trade agreements have been signed and they have not brought about prosperity; in Ecuador, the indigenous people of the Andes are against the free trade agreement; currently, in France, three million secondary school students are demonstrating because there are no jobs; and, where I live, the wine growers are poverty-stricken, people are committing suicide and yet there is free trade.\nThe observation demonstrating that the current free trade rules do not lead to economic prosperity indicates two possibilities. The first possibility is that free trade is the secular name for Christianity, whereby the wine growers of Europe, the small farmers and the workers must climb onto the Cross in order to atone for their worldly sins. In that case, let us continue and, in exchange for our concessions, Brazil and India will not open up their markets, and the Anglo-Saxon world will not recognise our intellectual property rights in relation to our agricultural designations. Thus, Commissioner, we are persevering on the poverty path which, after ten rounds of GATT and WTO negotiations, has done nothing for Africa.\nThe other possibility is that, finally, we stop making mistakes and follow the path of subscribing not to the archaic technique of reducing or abolishing customs duties, but to the modern technique of deducting customs duties. We will make the technological leap by inventing deductible customs duties because, in the form of tax credits that are offered to exporting countries and that can be used in the importing country, we shall have customs duties that ensure economic neutrality, and we shall resolve the tragedies brought about by globalisation.\nTell Mr\u00a0Mandelson that his role is not that of following in the footsteps of David Ricardo, but of having John Maynard Keynes\u2019 capacity for invention.", "lang": "FR", "original": "Jean-Claude Martinez (NI). - Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, Madame la Commissaire, ici tout le monde est d\u2019accord pour le libre commerce, personne ne veut refaire l\u2019Albanie d\u2019Enver Hoxha.

Dans ce cas, continuons et, en \u00e9change de nos concessions, le Br\u00e9sil, l\u2019Inde n\u2019ouvrent pas leur march\u00e9 et le monde anglo-saxon ne reconna\u00eet pas notre propri\u00e9t\u00e9 intellectuelle sur nos appellations agricoles.

On fait le saut technologique avec l\u2019invention de droits de douane d\u00e9ductibles parce que, sous forme de cr\u00e9dits d\u2019imp\u00f4ts offerts aux pays exportateurs et utilisables dans le pays importateur, on a l\u00e0 des droits de douane qui assurent la neutralit\u00e9 \u00e9conomique et on r\u00e9sout les drames de la mondialisation.\nDites \u00e0 Peter Mandelson que son r\u00f4le n\u2019est pas de suivre David Ricardo mais d\u2019avoir la capacit\u00e9 d\u2019invention de John Maynard Reynes.", "agenda_item": "WTO Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060403-ITEM-014", "intervention_id": "1-186", "summary_english": "```json\n{\n  \"headline\": \"Speaker argues current WTO free trade rules create poverty and proposes deductible customs duties system as modern alternative\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"The speaker raises concerns that current free trade rules under WTO/GATT have failed to create prosperity, citing examples from Mexico (94 free trade agreements without prosperity), Ecuador (indigenous opposition), France (unemployment leading to student demonstrations), and local wine growers facing poverty and suicide.
