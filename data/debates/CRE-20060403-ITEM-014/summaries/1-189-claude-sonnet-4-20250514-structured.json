{"speaker": "Alessandro Battilocchio (NI). \u2013", "english": "Alessandro Battilocchio (NI). \u2013 (IT) Mr\u00a0President, ladies and gentlemen, I speak on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party. For ten years now, the WTO has been overseeing the complex business of international trade. The quantity and quality of this trade is growing at an exponential rate. It is therefore becoming crucial to develop a strong, uniform regulatory framework that guarantees transparency and eliminates inequalities. The multilateral system is the only form of negotiation that is likely to guarantee a balanced approach among all the members.\nI therefore hope that Europe can defend this position within the new negotiations and work hard to conclude the agreements by the end of 2006, since a further failure would weaken the entire system and give rise to serious consequences, especially for developing countries. It is these countries, in particular, that we need to defend, and the industrialised countries\u2019 renunciation of export subsidies is a major step in this direction. Naturally, if an initiative of this kind is to have positive results, it must be duly supported and retabled by the other members of the WTO.\nFor the sake of the development of the least developed countries, it is also important to ensure that the liberalisation of other sectors, such as services, does not cause irreparable harm to the economic and social structure of those countries and, in particular, that the delivery of public services is not subject to the competition rules and commercial pressure of companies from the North.\nLastly, however, I urge the Commission to ensure that our production is protected, especially in those sectors in which the burden of counterfeiting and illegal importation is becoming intolerable for thousands of industries. The Commission must insist that the rules in force are strictly applied against these activities.", "lang": "IT", "original": "Alessandro Battilocchio (NI). \u2013 Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, parlo a nome del nuovo PSI. Da dieci anni l\u2019OMC controlla il complesso intrigo degli scambi commerciali internazionali. Tali scambi crescono esponenzialmente in numero e in qualit\u00e0. Diventa quindi indispensabile la messa a punto di un quadro normativo forte e omogeneo, che tuteli la trasparenza e abbatta le disuguaglianze. Il regime multilaterale \u00e8 l\u2019unica forma di negoziato che garantisca, plausibilmente, un approccio bilanciato tra tutti i membri.\nMi auguro quindi che l\u2019Europa sappia difendere questa posizione in seno ai nuovi negoziati e lavorare attivamente per concludere gli accordi entro il 2006, in quanto un nuovo fallimento indebolirebbe l\u2019intero sistema con gravi conseguenze, soprattutto per i paesi in via di sviluppo. \u00c8 soprattutto a questi ultimi che bisogna guardare e la rinuncia alle sovvenzioni all\u2019esportazione da parte dei paesi industrializzati rappresenta un grande passo in questo senso. Naturalmente affinch\u00e9 tale iniziativa abbia dei risultati positivi, \u00e8 importante che sia opportunamente appoggiata e riproposta dagli altri membri dell\u2019OMC.\nIn nome dello sviluppo dei paesi pi\u00f9 arretrati, \u00e8 importante inoltre vegliare affinch\u00e9 l\u2019apertura al mercato di altri settori, quali i servizi, non comprometta in modo irreparabile la struttura economica e sociale di tali paesi e in particolare che l\u2019erogazione dei servizi pubblici non sia soggetta alle regole della concorrenza e alla pressione commerciale da parte delle compagnie del nord.\nIn ultimo, tuttavia, esorto la Commissione a garantire la tutela della nostra produzione, soprattutto in quei settori in cui il peso della contraffazione e dell\u2019importazione illecita, sta diventando insopportabile per migliaia di industrie. La Commissione deve pretendere con forza l\u2019applicazione rigorosa delle norme in vigore contro tali fenomeni.", "agenda_item": "WTO Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060403-ITEM-014", "intervention_id": "1-189", "summary_english": "{\n\"headline\": \"European Multilateral Approach Needed in WTO Negotiations to Protect Developing Countries and Combat Trade Violations\",\n\"issueSum\": \"The speaker addresses the growing complexity of international trade under WTO oversight, the need for a strong regulatory framework, protecting developing countries from harmful liberalization, and combating counterfeiting and illegal imports affecting European industries.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"He supports a multilateral approach to WTO negotiations and wants Europe to defend this position while working to conclude agreements by end of 2006.
