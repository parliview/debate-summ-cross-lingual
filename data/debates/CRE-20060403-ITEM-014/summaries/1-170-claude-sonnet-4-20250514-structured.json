However, regrettably, this report and frequently the talks themselves fail to devote sufficient attention to solving European Union services sector problems in trade, while the European Union services sector accounts for 70 per cent of the European Union's gross domestic product. To emphasise this sector's importance and its importance for international trade services, I will just touch on two aspects. This affects financial sectors in particular. In developing countries, the lack of opportunity to take advantage of various progressive financial products, especially for small and medium business, where the largest proportion of these countries' populations are employed, hinders the modernisation of their economies and the transition of labour from agriculture to areas of higher productivity. On the other hand, the institutions of the European Union cannot exploit the potential of the huge financial services industry. We are very competitive in this area. And we are encountering problems when trading with developing countries in agricultural products. That is, in truth we must strive to change the structure of trade so that it is easier to work and so that a more modern economy is a more modern global economy. That is, we ought to encourage trade in financial services, which would allow developing countries to modernise their economies and would in turn make the international trade structure more effective. Of course, this means that we must discuss the introduction of standards covering the regulation of trade, company management and the regulation of financial services.", "lang": "LT", "original": "Margarita Starkevi\u010di\u016bt\u0117 (ALDE), Ekonomikos ir pinig\u0173 politikos komiteto nuomon\u0117s prane\u0161\u0117ja . \u2013 Atstovaudama Ekonomikos komiteto nuomonei, a\u0161 nor\u0117\u010diau pa\u017eym\u0117ti, kad teikiamas prane\u0161imas yra geriau subalansuotas negu iki \u0161iol buvo aptariami dokumentai pana\u0161ia tematika.
