SOLVIT shows European citizens a Europe with a human face. As we have heard, the system solved 300 cases in 2004. This is obviously a high number, if we take into account that five senior staff work at SOLVIT, and they found solutions to six difficulties each week. But if we remember that the European Union has a population of 450 million, 300 complaints do not seem to be so many after all. If the citizens visiting the offices of the 732 Members of Parliament would each contact SOLVIT with at least one complaint, this would already cause an insolvable problem. The reason for the relatively few complaints could be that there are few cases causing complaints, but a more likely reason is that few people are aware of this system, and we must expect that in the coming years, as the good reputation of the institution spreads, there will be more and more citizens intending to enforce their consumer protection rights within the SOLVIT system. This means that as the system becomes more and more popular, the workload of SOLVIT will increase, it will become more difficult due to the increasing integration of the internal market, and it will expand with the expansion of consumer culture.\nThis means that it would already be worth considering ways in which we could prepare the system to handle 500, 1 000 or even more requests efficiently, rapidly and pragmatically in five to ten years. This process will need appropriate human and financial resources. We must develop the framework and means of an administrative cooperation that works as efficiently as possible. And we must also think of how this extremely efficient, user friendly European service could be transformed into an equally efficient ingrained habit of Europe, consumers, entrepreneurs and citizens. We must consider the fact that, whichever way we vote on Thursday on the Services Directive, it is absolutely certain that the SOLVIT system will also be required in the area of services.\nTherefore we would like to encourage you, Commissioner, to support the reinforcement of the SOLVIT system and do everything in your power to make the system work.", "lang": "HU", "original": "Edit Herczog, a PSE k\u00e9pvisel\u0151csoport nev\u00e9ben . \u2013 Amikor a fogyaszt\u00f3v\u00e9delemr\u0151l, a v\u00e1llalkoz\u00e1soknak ny\u00fajtott seg\u00edts\u00e9gekr\u0151l vagy egy\u00e1ltal\u00e1n az uni\u00f3s jog terjeszt\u00e9s\u00e9r\u0151l \u00e9s \u00e9rv\u00e9nyre juttat\u00e1s\u00e1r\u00f3l besz\u00e9l\u00fcnk, mindig fontos t\u00f6rekv\u00e9sk\u00e9nt eml\u00edtj\u00fck a hat\u00e9konys\u00e1got, a gyakorlatiass\u00e1got.\nA SOLVIT \u00e9ppen az a rendszer, amely iskolap\u00e9ld\u00e1ja lehet az ilyen c\u00e9lkit\u0171z\u00e9sek megval\u00f3s\u00edt\u00e1s\u00e1nak.

But I, like others, have had many positive experiences in referring constituents to SOLVIT and seeing them come away as satisfied customers.\nHowever, the question certainly points out the problems: resources and publicity. If there is a good service there, then we surely need to tell more people about it; and if resources are needed and the problems are at Member State level, we need to try and address that.\nBut I want to draw attention to something else. Last week I had the opportunity to speak at a meeting hosted by the Commission of consumer representatives from consumer bureaux across the European Union. It is quite clear that there are still enormous problems in satisfying the cross-border difficulties that consumers encounter. I believe that we could do more to extend the SOLVIT-type system to these sorts of problems. The SOLVIT system is, after all, simple, pragmatic and practical \u2013 surely an example of the best sort of thing we do, rather than being overly legalistic.

However, this market often fails to operate as it should. The law is often unclear and incoherent and problems concerning its interpretation arise constantly. As a result, individuals and economic entities have to deal with many obstacles in the course of their activities. The SOLVIT system can be very helpful in such cases.\nThe unquestionable advantage of the network is that it deals with complaints from both citizens and entrepreneurs, and that it is required to find solutions to any problem raised within a short period of time. Another important feature is that SOLVIT is free of charge. Also, according to official statistics, it resolves 75% of the cases it takes on. SOLVIT is a type of instrument which allows the European Union to ascertain whether legislation adopted is being applied appropriately by Member States. A further advantage of the network is that thanks to its negotiating skills, SOLVIT is able to find quicker and far cheaper solutions than the courts could to even the most complicated problems.\nIn order to guarantee high operating standards, SOLVIT has recently introduced a range of improvements to facilitate communication between networks and the individuals or entrepreneurs seeking solutions to their problems. As a result, my constituency office has also been linked to the SOLVIT network. This enables the citizens of my region to bring their problems to my assistants and seek help through us.\nIn view of the SOLVIT network\u2019s success to date, I believe it should be developed further. That is why I fully support the proposal to increase the human resources allocated substantially above the four officials currently assigned to it.\nThere can be no doubt that the concept of the operation of the European SOLVIT system as an instrument to resolve problems within the internal market is a worthy one and deserves strong support. Nonetheless, as politicians responsible for law making, it is incumbent on us to make every effort to create clear, transparent and wise laws. These laws should meet the citizens\u2019 and entrepreneurs\u2019 expectations. They should also foster economic development and the creation of a genuine single market. It is an inspired venture, close to the hearts of the founding fathers of the European Union. Unfortunately, it has not yet been fully developed.\nIn the course of this parliamentary sitting we shall have a good opportunity to make up for lost time where the creation of a single market in services is concerned. We must not give in to public pressure. Instead, we must send out a clear signal that Parliament is determined to create a genuine single market where there will no longer be problems for the SOLVIT programme to resolve.

One of the advantages of SOLVIT is the fact that any periods of prescription applied by courts are suspended.\nAround 800 cases have been registered with the EU's SOLVIT, and of these 80% have been resolved. In the first year of SOLVIT being operational, Lithuania dealt with 10 complaints. Seven of these complaints were directed against Lithuania and three were directed by Lithuania against other states. Citizens made 90% of complaints; the majority about freedom of movement for persons. Lithuania is among those countries where all complaints are resolved on time, on average within 43 days. This is despite the fact that there is only one member of staff working at SOLVIT in Lithuania. However, there are areas of SOLVIT's activities, which may still be improved both in Lithuania and other countries.\nThe small number of SOLVIT cases being processed shows that not only citizens but even some state institutions know little about this system. This is the main obstacle to solving internal market problems through SOLVIT.

Debate Information\n\n**Date:** February 13, 2006  \n**Number of Contributions:** 10 speakers  \n**Topic:** SOLVIT - The EU's problem-solving network for internal market disputes\n\nThis parliamentary debate addressed the functioning, effectiveness, and future development of SOLVIT, the European Union's online network for resolving problems related to the incorrect application of internal market law by public administrations.\n\n## 2. Executive Summary\n\n### Issues Raised\n\nThe debate centered on several key challenges facing the SOLVIT system:\n- **Resource constraints** at both Commission and Member State levels\n- **Low public awareness** of SOLVIT's existence and capabilities\n- **Need for better promotion** to citizens, businesses, and institutions\n- **Capacity concerns** for handling future growth in cases\n- **Integration challenges** with other EU services like Europe Direct\n\n### Speaker Positions and Arguments\n\n**Arlene McCarthy (PSE)** opened the debate with strong support for SOLVIT, calling it essential for EU credibility. She shared a citizen testimonial: \"SOLVIT is a great service and it should really shout louder about its achievements\" [McCarthy, 2006-02-13]. McCarthy argued that \"when errors or problems arise in the implementation of EU laws, not only are citizens denied their rights, but the very credibility of the EU as a law-making institution is undermined\" [McCarthy, 2006-02-13].\n\n**Commissioner Charlie McCreevy** responded positively, describing SOLVIT as \"more than just a system, it is in many ways the starting point of a change in administrative culture\" [McCreevy, 2006-02-13]. He emphasized that \"after three years of experience, the Commission can wholeheartedly recommend SOLVIT as an alternative, fast and effective way of handling complaints\" [McCreevy, 2006-02-13]. McCreevy identified two key challenges: changing Member State administrative practices and ensuring sufficient national resources.\n\n**Malcolm Harbour (PPE-DE)** strongly endorsed SOLVIT based on personal experience as a pilot user, stating his office had \"been extremely gratified by the results\" [Harbour, 2006-02-13]. He emphasized the need for cultural change, urging the Commissioner to \"put pressure on the Member States as well\" [Harbour, 2006-02-13].\n\n**Edit Herczog (PSE)** praised SOLVIT as showing \"European citizens a Europe with a human face\" [Herczog, 2006-02-13] but raised concerns about capacity. Despite solving 300 cases in 2004, she noted this was minimal given the EU's 450 million inhabitants, arguing it was \"already worth considering ways in which we could prepare the system to handle 500, 1,000 or even more requests efficiently\" [Herczog, 2006-02-13].\n\n**Diana Wallis (ALDE)** supported SOLVIT expansion, observing that \"when the SOLVIT system works it makes the internal market work\" [Wallis, 2006-02-13]. She advocated extending the system beyond administrative problems, describing it as \"simple, pragmatic and practical \u2013 surely an example of the best sort of thing we do, rather than being overly legalistic\" [Wallis, 2006-02-13].\n\n**Godfrey Bloom (IND/DEM)** provided the sole dissenting voice, opposing taxpayer funding and suggesting supporters should \"pay for it themselves, instead of squeezing ever more money out of the hard-pressed British taxpayer\" [Bloom, 2006-02-13].\n\n**Adam Jerzy Bielan (UEN)** supported SOLVIT's expansion while emphasizing the need for better EU legislation. He noted SOLVIT's 75% success rate and argued politicians should \"create clear, transparent and wise laws\" to reduce the need for problem-solving services [Bielan, 2006-02-13].\n\n**Danut\u0117 Budreikait\u0117 (ALDE)** highlighted Lithuania's successful experience, resolving complaints within 43 days despite having only one staff member. She emphasized that \"the small number of SOLVIT cases being processed shows that not only citizens but even some state institutions know little about this system\" [Budreikait\u0117, 2006-02-13].\n\n### Key Proposals\n\n**Resource Enhancement:**\n- Increase Commission SOLVIT support team (McCreevy noted expansion to 5 full-time, 4 part-time staff)\n- Strengthen Member State SOLVIT centers with adequate staffing\n- Provide financial support for awareness-raising activities\n\n**Awareness and Promotion:**\n- Launch publicity campaigns for citizens and businesses\n- Revamp website to include real-life solved cases\n- Better inform MEPs, libraries, consumer organizations, and local authorities\n- Integrate SOLVIT promotion with Europe Direct services\n\n**System Development:**\n- Develop internal market information system based on SOLVIT success\n- Extend SOLVIT-type mechanisms to consumer cross-border problems\n- Utilize SOLVIT for Services Directive implementation support\n- Maintain flexibility by avoiding binding legal framework\n\n### Commissioner's Final Position\n\nMcCreevy concluded by advocating for simplicity, warning against over-formalization: \"We should not make it a victim of its own success by formalising it or making it heavy-handed\" [McCreevy, 2006-02-13]. His recommendation was clear: \"keep it simple\" [McCreevy, 2006-02-13], while ensuring proper resources and awareness.\n\nThe debate revealed broad parliamentary support for strengthening SOLVIT as a practical, efficient alternative to lengthy legal proceedings, with consensus on the need for better resources, promotion, and potential expansion of the system's scope.", "src_model": "claude", "model_type": "claude", "model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "structured": false, "incremental": false, "hierarchical": false, "grouped": false, "shuffle": false, "prompt": false, "lang": "original"}
