That is why we have tabled a number of questions to the Commissioner to assist in further developing and supporting the SOLVIT network.\nI want to share with you the view of a United Kingdom citizen living in the Netherlands who used the SOLVIT system. He said, \u2018SOLVIT is a great service and it should really shout louder about its achievements\u2019. The positive achievements and experiences of our citizens translate into positive attitudes towards Europe, and I believe that our duty as legislators has to be to ensure that the laws we pass are implemented in a way that gives our citizens and consumers the benefits of working, living or doing business in the internal market.\nWhen errors or problems arise in the implementation of EU laws, not only are citizens denied their rights, but the very credibility of the EU as a law-making institution is undermined. SOLVIT is a means of righting these wrongs and assisting national administrations in ensuring the correct implementation and transposition of the legislation that we pass together in the European Union. At the same time, it has the potential to be the customer service face, or the front desk, of the EU law-making process. It can influence people\u2019s perceptions of the EU.\nI have referred constituency cases to the SOLVIT network and have been impressed with how the issues have been handled and with the prompt responses to our questions.

Clearly, however, SOLVIT needs more resources and support, and needs to promote itself and its availability to the public.

SOLVIT shows European citizens a Europe with a human face. As we have heard, the system solved 300 cases in 2004. This is obviously a high number, if we take into account that five senior staff work at SOLVIT, and they found solutions to six difficulties each week. But if we remember that the European Union has a population of 450 million, 300 complaints do not seem to be so many after all. If the citizens visiting the offices of the 732 Members of Parliament would each contact SOLVIT with at least one complaint, this would already cause an insolvable problem. The reason for the relatively few complaints could be that there are few cases causing complaints, but a more likely reason is that few people are aware of this system, and we must expect that in the coming years, as the good reputation of the institution spreads, there will be more and more citizens intending to enforce their consumer protection rights within the SOLVIT system. This means that as the system becomes more and more popular, the workload of SOLVIT will increase, it will become more difficult due to the increasing integration of the internal market, and it will expand with the expansion of consumer culture.\nThis means that it would already be worth considering ways in which we could prepare the system to handle 500, 1 000 or even more requests efficiently, rapidly and pragmatically in five to ten years. This process will need appropriate human and financial resources. We must develop the framework and means of an administrative cooperation that works as efficiently as possible. And we must also think of how this extremely efficient, user friendly European service could be transformed into an equally efficient ingrained habit of Europe, consumers, entrepreneurs and citizens. We must consider the fact that, whichever way we vote on Thursday on the Services Directive, it is absolutely certain that the SOLVIT system will also be required in the area of services.\nTherefore we would like to encourage you, Commissioner, to support the reinforcement of the SOLVIT system and do everything in your power to make the system work.", "lang": "HU", "original": "Edit Herczog, a PSE k\u00e9pvisel\u0151csoport nev\u00e9ben . \u2013 Amikor a fogyaszt\u00f3v\u00e9delemr\u0151l, a v\u00e1llalkoz\u00e1soknak ny\u00fajtott seg\u00edts\u00e9gekr\u0151l vagy egy\u00e1ltal\u00e1n az uni\u00f3s jog terjeszt\u00e9s\u00e9r\u0151l \u00e9s \u00e9rv\u00e9nyre juttat\u00e1s\u00e1r\u00f3l besz\u00e9l\u00fcnk, mindig fontos t\u00f6rekv\u00e9sk\u00e9nt eml\u00edtj\u00fck a hat\u00e9konys\u00e1got, a gyakorlatiass\u00e1got.\nA SOLVIT \u00e9ppen az a rendszer, amely iskolap\u00e9ld\u00e1ja lehet az ilyen c\u00e9lkit\u0171z\u00e9sek megval\u00f3s\u00edt\u00e1s\u00e1nak.

However, this market often fails to operate as it should. The law is often unclear and incoherent and problems concerning its interpretation arise constantly. As a result, individuals and economic entities have to deal with many obstacles in the course of their activities. The SOLVIT system can be very helpful in such cases.\nThe unquestionable advantage of the network is that it deals with complaints from both citizens and entrepreneurs, and that it is required to find solutions to any problem raised within a short period of time. Another important feature is that SOLVIT is free of charge. Also, according to official statistics, it resolves 75% of the cases it takes on. SOLVIT is a type of instrument which allows the European Union to ascertain whether legislation adopted is being applied appropriately by Member States. A further advantage of the network is that thanks to its negotiating skills, SOLVIT is able to find quicker and far cheaper solutions than the courts could to even the most complicated problems.\nIn order to guarantee high operating standards, SOLVIT has recently introduced a range of improvements to facilitate communication between networks and the individuals or entrepreneurs seeking solutions to their problems. As a result, my constituency office has also been linked to the SOLVIT network. This enables the citizens of my region to bring their problems to my assistants and seek help through us.\nIn view of the SOLVIT network\u2019s success to date, I believe it should be developed further. That is why I fully support the proposal to increase the human resources allocated substantially above the four officials currently assigned to it.\nThere can be no doubt that the concept of the operation of the European SOLVIT system as an instrument to resolve problems within the internal market is a worthy one and deserves strong support. Nonetheless, as politicians responsible for law making, it is incumbent on us to make every effort to create clear, transparent and wise laws. These laws should meet the citizens\u2019 and entrepreneurs\u2019 expectations. They should also foster economic development and the creation of a genuine single market. It is an inspired venture, close to the hearts of the founding fathers of the European Union. Unfortunately, it has not yet been fully developed.\nIn the course of this parliamentary sitting we shall have a good opportunity to make up for lost time where the creation of a single market in services is concerned. We must not give in to public pressure. Instead, we must send out a clear signal that Parliament is determined to create a genuine single market where there will no longer be problems for the SOLVIT programme to resolve.

EU companies and citizens can use SOLVIT to solve problems related to the movement of goods, social security, migration, recognition of qualifications, etc. SOLVIT offers the complainant an opportunity to save time and avoid expensive judicial proceedings. This is particularly relevant for citizens and small, and medium businesses. One of the advantages of SOLVIT is the fact that any periods of prescription applied by courts are suspended.\nAround 800 cases have been registered with the EU's SOLVIT, and of these 80% have been resolved. In the first year of SOLVIT being operational, Lithuania dealt with 10 complaints. Seven of these complaints were directed against Lithuania and three were directed by Lithuania against other states. Citizens made 90% of complaints; the majority about freedom of movement for persons. Lithuania is among those countries where all complaints are resolved on time, on average within 43 days. This is despite the fact that there is only one member of staff working at SOLVIT in Lithuania. However, there are areas of SOLVIT's activities, which may still be improved both in Lithuania and other countries.\nThe small number of SOLVIT cases being processed shows that not only citizens but even some state institutions know little about this system. This is the main obstacle to solving internal market problems through SOLVIT. We must let the public know about the opportunities SOLVIT offers and organise publicity campaigns for citizens and businesses.\nI urge the European Commission to encourage national governments to strengthen SOLVIT's power with more human resources, and urge the Commission itself to support SOLVIT's work financially.", "lang": "LT", "original": "Danut\u0117 Budreikait\u0117 (ALDE). \u2013 Gerbiamas pirmininke, ponios ir ponai, prie\u0161 trejus metus Europos Komisija pasi\u016bl\u0117 SOLVIT priemon\u0119, skirt\u0105 vidaus rinkos taisykli\u0173 pa\u017eeidim\u0173 neteisminiam sprendimui.

Debate Information\n\n- **Date:** [Date not provided in transcript]\n- **Number of Contributions:** 11 identified speaker interventions (with several unrecorded, as noted by absence of text for some speakers)\n- **Topic:** SOLVIT Network\u2014Enhancing Problem-Solving for EU Citizens and Businesses in the Internal Market\n\n---\n\n### 2. Executive Summary\n\n#### Overview\n\nThis parliamentary debate centered on the SOLVIT network, an EU-wide, non-judicial on-line mechanism for resolving complaints from citizens and businesses encountering misapplication of EU law by public authorities in cross-border situations. The debate explored the effectiveness, resource needs, future expansion, and political challenges facing SOLVIT, as well as different perspectives on its funding and strategic direction.\n\n#### Key Issues Discussed\n\n1. **Effectiveness and Current Strengths of SOLVIT**\n    - Multiple speakers\u2014including Arlene McCarthy, Charlie McCreevy, Malcolm Harbour, Edit Herczog, Diana Wallis, Adam Jerzy Bielan, and Danut\u0117 Budreikait\u0117\u2014praised SOLVIT\u2019s record in resolving disputes rapidly and pragmatically, positioning it as a successful alternative to lengthy court proceedings.\n    - McCreevy declared, \u201cThe Commission can wholeheartedly recommend SOLVIT as an alternative, fast and effective way of handling complaints\u201d [Charlie McCreevy, date not specified].\n\n2. **Resource Allocation and Capacity**\n    - There was widespread agreement that SOLVIT\u2019s effectiveness is hampered by insufficient resources at both national and EU levels. Harbour stressed, \u201cWe also have to get the Member States to put the resources in and gear up their activities\u201d [Malcolm Harbour, date not specified]. Budreikait\u0117 cited situations where only one person was responsible for SOLVIT cases in Lithuania and called for \u201cthe European Commission\u2026to support SOLVIT finacially\u201d [Danut\u0117 Budreikait\u0117, date not specified].\n\n3. **Awareness and Publicity**\n    - Low public awareness of SOLVIT was repeatedly highlighted as a barrier to greater usage and impact. Danut\u0117 Budreikait\u0117 noted, \u201cNedidelis SOLVIT sprend\u017eiam\u0173 atvej\u0173 skai\u010dius rodo, kad apie \u0161i\u0105 veikl\u0105 ma\u017eai \u017eino ne tik pilie\u010diai, bet ir kai kurios valstybin\u0117s institucijos\u201d [Danut\u0117 Budreikait\u0117, date not specified]. Diana Wallis insisted, \u201cIf there is a good service there, then we surely need to tell more people about it\u201d [Diana Wallis, date not specified].\n    - To address this, both speakers advocated for information campaigns and improved cooperation with organizations such as Europe Direct and \u2018one-stop shops\u2019 under the Services Directive.\n\n4. **Change of Administrative Culture and Member State Commitment**\n    - Several speakers, led by Harbour and McCreevy, pointed out that full realisation of SOLVIT\u2019s potential depends on a culture shift in Member State administrations. Harbour stated, \u201cIt is the change of culture that is going to be absolutely vital in this respect\u201d [Malcolm Harbour, date not specified].\n    - McCreevy further observed, \u201cThere are currently two issues that need to be addressed\u2026 the need for Member States\u2019 authorities to change administrative practices and habits, and ensuring that sufficient resources are available at national level\u201d [Charlie McCreevy, date not specified].\n\n5. **Future Expansion and Adaptation**\n    - There was a consensus on the need to expand SOLVIT\u2019s capacity and remit, especially as the Single Market\u2014and its volume of cross-border activity\u2014grows.\n    - Edit Herczog urged planning for increased demand \u201cwithin 5-10 years\u201d and advocated for \u201cmore efficient administrative cooperation instruments\u201d [Edit Herczog, date not specified].\n    - Diana Wallis proposed \u201cwe could do more to extend the SOLVIT-type system to these sorts of problems\u201d involving cross-border consumer disputes [Diana Wallis, date not specified], and Adam Jerzy Bielan advocated for supporting the Services Directive to boost the Single Market.\n\n6. **Concerns and Criticism\u2014Funding Objections**\n    - In contrast with the widely positive assessments, Godfrey Bloom took a dissenting position, criticizing public funding of SOLVIT: \u201cthe people who think this network is a really good idea pay for it themselves, instead of squeezing ever more money out of the hard-pressed British taxpayer\u201d [Godfrey Bloom, date not specified]. No other speaker supported this view.\n\n7. **Maintain Simplicity and Flexibility**\n    - McCreevy, in a follow-up, warned against making SOLVIT \u201ca victim of its own success by formalising it or making it heavy-handed\u2026the recommendation for SOLVIT is\u2026keep it simple\u201d [Charlie McCreevy, date not specified].\n\n#### Comparative Analysis of Speakers\u2019 Proposals\n\n| Speaker              | Position | Main Proposals                                                                                       |\n|----------------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Arlene McCarthy**      | Strong Support | More resources, better public promotion, improve website, align with Services Directive, more cooperation with related services                                        |\n| **Charlie McCreevy**     | Strong Support | Member States to change practices and increase resources, boost political profile, broaden internal market info, but caution against over-formalization                |\n| **Malcolm Harbour**      | Strong Support | Greater Member State commitment and resource allocation, pressure from Commission, administrative cultural change                                                       |\n| **Edit Herczog**         | Strong Support | Strengthen for anticipated growth, more human and financial resources, improve cooperation tools                                    |\n| **Diana Wallis**         | Support & Expansion | More resources, expanded remit to consumer issues, greater publicity                                                                |\n| **Godfrey Bloom**        | Opposed | No additional taxpayer funding, advocates private funding                                                                              |\n| **Adam Jerzy Bielan**    | Strong Support | Increase human resources, further develop SOLVIT, support Services Directive                                                         |\n| **Danut\u0117 Budreikait\u0117**   | Strong Support | Organize awareness campaigns, urge Commission and Member States for resource bolstering and financial support                                                             |\n\n#### Conclusions and Action Points\n\n- **Resourcing:** Across the board (except Godfrey Bloom), speakers called for both EU and Member States to bolster SOLVIT with more human and financial resources.\n- **Awareness:** Boosting public and institutional awareness via campaigns, website improvements, case studies, and outreach (including through libraries, consumer groups, SMEs, and MEPs) is essential to leverage SOLVIT\u2019s value.\n- **Cultural Change:** Administrative reforms and heightened engagement at the Member State level are necessary to fully integrate SOLVIT as a core tool for enforcing and troubleshooting EU law.\n- **Expansion:** Plans should be laid to expand the remit and capacity of SOLVIT to meet anticipated increases in Single Market activity, especially as the Services Directive and 'one-stop shops' come into force.\n- **Simplicity:** The Commission should heed warnings not to over-formalize the mechanism, preserving SOLVIT\u2019s flexible, user-friendly character while making iterative improvements.\n- **Funding Critique:** Only Godfrey Bloom resisted further public expenditure on SOLVIT, a minority position not echoed or supported by others.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps:**\n- Commit EU and Member State funding to build up SOLVIT\u2019s teams and operational capacity.\n- Launch widespread awareness-raising activities targeting both citizens and government agencies.\n- Mandate Member States to review and reform administrative approaches in support of SOLVIT.\n- Develop a strategic roadmap for expanding SOLVIT\u2019s remit, maintaining its flexibility and practicality, and integrating improved technological and procedural tools.\n\n---\n\n*This executive summary captures the substance and diversity of viewpoints expressed in the parliamentary debate on SOLVIT, referencing direct quotations with speaker attribution as per the provided transcript.*", "src_model": "gpt", "model_type": "gpt", "model_name": "gpt-4.1", "structured": true, "incremental": false, "hierarchical": false, "grouped": false, "shuffle": false, "prompt": false, "lang": "original"}
