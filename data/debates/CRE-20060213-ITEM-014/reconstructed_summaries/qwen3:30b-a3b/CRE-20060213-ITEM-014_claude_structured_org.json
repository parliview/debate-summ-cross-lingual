The user provided a debate summary about the SOLVIT network and wants the response structured in JSON based on the speaker's contributions. The speaker in question is \"President.\" \n\nFirst, I need to check the debate summary to see if the President made any statements. Scanning through the sections, the summary mentions various speakers like Charlie McCreevy, Edit Herczog, Adam Jerzy Bielan, Malcolm Harbour, Arlene McCarthy, Danut\u0117 Budreikait\u0117, Diana Wallis, and Godfrey Bloom. However, there's no mention of a \"President\" in the contributions. \n\nThe user's example response includes sections like issueSum, positionSum, argSum, and propSum. But since the President isn't listed as a speaker in the debate summary provided, there's no information to attribute to them. \n\nI should confirm if \"President\" refers to someone specific. Maybe the President of the Commission or another role? But the summary doesn't mention any president. The closest is Commissioner Charlie McCreevy, but that's a different name. \n\nSince there's no data on the President's contributions, the correct response is an empty JSON object. The user instructed to return an empty string if there are no points, but the example uses a JSON with empty strings. Wait, the user's example shows empty strings, but the instructions say to respond with an empty string. However, the example given by the user has the JSON structure with empty strings. \n\nBut the user's exact instruction says: \"If this is the case, respond with an empty string.\" However, the example shows a JSON. There's a conflict here. But looking back, the user says: \"You must respond in json format. Outputs must be parseable by json.loads(). If this is the case, respond with an empty string.\"\n\nWait, the user says to respond with an empty string, but the example shows a JSON. This is confusing. However, the user's example response is a JSON, but the instruction says to respond with an empty string. Maybe the user made a mistake, but I should follow the instructions. \n\nBut the user's example shows that when there are no points, the response is an empty JSON. Wait, the user's example has \"issueSum\": \"...\" etc., but if there are no points, the response should be an empty string. However, the user's example shows a JSON structure. \n\nBut the user's instruction says: \"If this is the case, respond with an empty string.\" So, in this case, since the President isn't mentioned, the response should be an empty string. However, the user's example shows a JSON. But the user's instruction says to respond in JSON. \n\nThis is conflicting. However, the user's example shows a JSON, but the instruction says to respond with an empty string. But the user also says \"You must respond in json format. Outputs must be parseable by json.loads().\"\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to return an empty JSON object, not an empty string. Because an empty string isn't valid JSON. So maybe the user's instruction has a mistake, and the correct response is an empty JSON. \n\nBut the user's example shows that when there are points, it's a JSON with the four fields. If there are no points, then the response should be an empty JSON. However, the user says \"respond with an empty string.\" But that's not valid JSON. \n\nThis is a bit confusing, but given the user's example, I think they expect a JSON object even if it's empty. So, in this case, since the President isn't mentioned, the response would be an empty JSON object. \n\nTherefore, the answer is an empty JSON.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"\",\n\"positionSum\": \"\",\n\"argSum\": \"\",\n\"propSum\": \"\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Arlene McCarthy (PSE),", "english": "Arlene McCarthy (PSE), author . \u2013 It was my predecessor, Philip Whitehead, who tabled this question on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, and I know that he would have wanted to ensure that we support the SOLVIT system and encourage the Commission to refine and develop the problem-solving network on behalf of EU citizens and consumers.

Let me start by reading through the summary carefully.\n\nThe debate is about the SOLVIT network, which is an EU mechanism for resolving cross-border administrative issues. The user wants the main points or arguments made by Charlie McCreevy. The key sections in the summary are the Executive Summary and the sections under Current Performance and Success, Resource and Capacity Concerns, etc.\n\nLooking at the Executive Summary, it mentions that Commissioner Charlie McCreevy highlighted SOLVIT's proven track record, saying it's an alternative, fast, and effective way. He also mentioned that SOLVIT is more than just a system, it's a starting point for changing administrative culture. \n\nIn the Current Performance section, McCreevy's quote is included: \"SOLVIT is more than just a system, it is in many ways the starting point of a change in administrative culture.\" That's a key point about his position. \n\nAlso, under the \"Proposals for Enhancement\" section, McCreevy is mentioned as announcing that the Commission is allocating more resources to the SOLVIT support team. So he's talking about increasing resources. \n\nIn the Philosophical Approach section, McCreevy cautioned against over-formalization, saying \"keep it simple.\" So he's against making it too formal or bureaucratic.\n\nNow, the user wants the response in JSON format with issueSum, positionSum, argSum, propSum. Let me structure each part.\n\nIssueSum: The key issues McCreevy raised would be the effectiveness of SOLVIT and the need to maintain its simplicity while expanding. Also, resource allocation.\n\nPositionSum: His position is supporting SOLVIT's effectiveness and advocating for more resources but also cautioning against over-formalization. He sees it as a cultural change tool.\n\nArgSum: The arguments would be based on its proven track record and the need to balance expansion with simplicity to avoid bureaucracy.\n\nPropSum: His proposals include increasing resources (more staff) and maintaining simplicity.\n\nWait, but the user said to only include points attributed to the speaker. Let me check again. The summary mentions McCreevy in several places. \n\nIn the Current Performance section, he said SOLVIT is effective, with resolution rates and quick turnaround. Also, he mentioned it's a starting point for administrative culture change. \n\nIn the Proposals section, he announced allocating more resources (five full-time and four part-time staff). \n\nIn the Philosophical Approach, he warned against over-formalization, advocating to keep it simple.\n\nSo the issues he raised are the effectiveness of SOLVIT, resource needs, and the need to keep it simple. His positions are supporting SOLVIT's role, advocating for more resources, and cautioning against formalization. The arguments are based on its success and the need to maintain simplicity. Proposals include resource allocation and keeping the system simple.\n\nI need to make sure not to include other speakers' points. For example, other speakers talked about public awareness, but McCreevy's points are specific. \n\nSo compiling all that into the JSON structure. Let me draft each part:\n\nissueSum: The key issues include SOLVIT's effectiveness, resource allocation, and the need to maintain simplicity. \n\npositionSum: Supports SOLVIT's effectiveness and its role in administrative culture change, advocates for increased resources, and emphasizes keeping the system simple.\n\nargSum: His arguments are based on SOLVIT's proven track record and the need to avoid over-formalization to maintain efficiency.\n\npropSum: Proposes increasing resources (staff) and maintaining simplicity in the system.\n\nI need to make sure the JSON is correctly formatted, with each field as a string. Also, check for any other points. The user's example uses concise summaries. Let me make sure each section is a summary without details.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The effectiveness of the SOLVIT network, resource allocation, and the need to maintain its simplicity while addressing future capacity challenges.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"Committed to strengthening SOLVIT's role as an effective, fast, and practical solution for cross-border administrative issues, while emphasizing the importance of maintaining its simplicity and avoiding over-formalization.\",\n\"argSum\": \"Argued that SOLVIT's success is evidenced by its high resolution rates and efficiency, and that its continued effectiveness depends on balancing resource expansion with a focus on simplicity to prevent bureaucratic overload.\",\n\"propSum\": \"Proposed increasing resources for SOLVIT, including expanding the support team, while advocating for a continued emphasis on simplicity and practicality in the system's operation.\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Malcolm Harbour,", "english": "Malcolm Harbour, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . \u2013 Mr President, I very much welcome this question.

The summary says: \"Malcolm Harbour emphasized that 'you need to put pressure on the Member States as well' to provide adequate resources at national level.\" \n\nSo, the key points here are about resource allocation.

The argument is that without sufficient resources, the system might not handle the volume of cases. The proposal is to put pressure on Member States.\n\nI need to make sure there's no other info about him elsewhere.

SOLVIT shows European citizens a Europe with a human face. As we have heard, the system solved 300 cases in 2004. This is obviously a high number, if we take into account that five senior staff work at SOLVIT, and they found solutions to six difficulties each week. But if we remember that the European Union has a population of 450 million, 300 complaints do not seem to be so many after all. If the citizens visiting the offices of the 732 Members of Parliament would each contact SOLVIT with at least one complaint, this would already cause an insolvable problem. The reason for the relatively few complaints could be that there are few cases causing complaints, but a more likely reason is that few people are aware of this system, and we must expect that in the coming years, as the good reputation of the institution spreads, there will be more and more citizens intending to enforce their consumer protection rights within the SOLVIT system. This means that as the system becomes more and more popular, the workload of SOLVIT will increase, it will become more difficult due to the increasing integration of the internal market, and it will expand with the expansion of consumer culture.\nThis means that it would already be worth considering ways in which we could prepare the system to handle 500, 1 000 or even more requests efficiently, rapidly and pragmatically in five to ten years. This process will need appropriate human and financial resources. We must develop the framework and means of an administrative cooperation that works as efficiently as possible. And we must also think of how this extremely efficient, user friendly European service could be transformed into an equally efficient ingrained habit of Europe, consumers, entrepreneurs and citizens. We must consider the fact that, whichever way we vote on Thursday on the Services Directive, it is absolutely certain that the SOLVIT system will also be required in the area of services.\nTherefore we would like to encourage you, Commissioner, to support the reinforcement of the SOLVIT system and do everything in your power to make the system work.", "lang": "HU", "original": "Edit Herczog, a PSE k\u00e9pvisel\u0151csoport nev\u00e9ben . \u2013 Amikor a fogyaszt\u00f3v\u00e9delemr\u0151l, a v\u00e1llalkoz\u00e1soknak ny\u00fajtott seg\u00edts\u00e9gekr\u0151l vagy egy\u00e1ltal\u00e1n az uni\u00f3s jog terjeszt\u00e9s\u00e9r\u0151l \u00e9s \u00e9rv\u00e9nyre juttat\u00e1s\u00e1r\u00f3l besz\u00e9l\u00fcnk, mindig fontos t\u00f6rekv\u00e9sk\u00e9nt eml\u00edtj\u00fck a hat\u00e9konys\u00e1got, a gyakorlatiass\u00e1got.\nA SOLVIT \u00e9ppen az a rendszer, amely iskolap\u00e9ld\u00e1ja lehet az ilyen c\u00e9lkit\u0171z\u00e9sek megval\u00f3s\u00edt\u00e1s\u00e1nak.

The user provided a debate summary about SOLVIT and wants the main points from Edit Herczog's speech. First, I need to go through the debate summary and find any mentions of her.\n\nLooking at the \"Executive Summary\" section, under \"Resource and Capacity Concerns,\" there's a mention of Edit Herczog. The summary says she warned about future capacity issues, noting that in 2004, the system solved 300 cases with only 5 staff, which is a small fraction given the EU's population. \n\nSo, the key points here are about resource allocation and capacity. Her main argument is that the current resources are insufficient as the system grows. The issue she raises is the adequacy of resources for future needs. Her position is that there's a need for more capacity. The argument is based on the comparison of cases handled versus the population size. The proposal would be increasing staffing, but the summary doesn't mention specific proposals from her beyond warning about capacity issues.\n\nI need to make sure I don't include other speakers' points. The user specified to only include points from Edit Herczog. The example response structure requires issueSum, positionSum, argSum, propSum. \n\nSo, issueSum would be about resource allocation and capacity. PositionSum is her warning about future capacity issues. ArgSum is the basis of her concern, which is the low staff-to-population ratio. PropSum isn't directly mentioned, but maybe she implied increasing resources. However, the summary doesn't state a specific proposal from her, just a warning. So propSum might be empty. Wait, the example had a propSum even if it's not explicit. But according to the instructions, if there's no points, return empty. The user says \"if this is the case, respond with an empty string.\"\n\nIn the debate summary, Edit Herczog's contribution is only the part about capacity issues. There's no specific proposal mentioned, just a warning. So propSum would be empty. Let me check again. The summary says she \"warned about future capacity issues\" and cited the 2004 example. So her arguments are based on the current staff numbers not scaling with the EU's population. The issue is resource allocation. Her position is that there's a need for more capacity. The argument is the comparison of cases handled vs. population. No specific proposal, so propSum is empty.\n\nSo the JSON should have issueSum: \"Resource allocation and capacity concerns\", positionSum: \"Warned about future capacity issues, noting that the system's current capacity is insufficient given the EU's population\", argSum: \"Cited the 2004 example where 5 staff handled 300 cases, which is a small fraction relative to the EU's 450 million inhabitants\", propSum: \"\".\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"Resource allocation and capacity concerns for the SOLVIT network\",\n\"positionSum\": \"Warned about future capacity issues, noting that the system's current capacity is insufficient given the EU's population\",\n\"argSum\": \"Cited the 2004 example where 5 staff handled 300 cases, which is a small fraction relative to the EU's 450 million inhabitants\",\n\"propSum\": \"\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Diana Wallis,", "english": "Diana Wallis, on behalf of the ALDE Group . \u2013 Mr President, this is indeed a special question, and it is good that it represents the continuity between our former chairman, Mr Whitehead, and Mrs McCarthy.\nWhen the SOLVIT system works it makes the internal market work.

The user provided a debate summary about the SOLVIT network and wants me to focus on Godfrey Bloom's contributions. The task is to extract the main points he made, but according to the instructions, I should only include what's attributed to him.\n\nLooking at the debate summary, under the \"Dissenting Voice\" section, it mentions that Godfrey Bloom opposed the initiative on fiscal grounds. His argument was that those who support SOLVIT should fund it themselves instead of using public money from taxpayers. \n\nSo, the issue he raised is about funding sources\u2014specifically, opposing public funding. His position is against using taxpayer money, advocating for self-funding. The argument is fiscal, emphasizing that supporters should bear the cost. There's no mention of proposals from him beyond that point. \n\nI need to structure this into the JSON fields. The issueSum should mention fiscal concerns and public funding. PositionSum would state his opposition to public funding. ArgSum explains his reasoning as fiscal grounds. PropSum would note his proposal for self-funding. \n\nWait, but the example response has \"propSum\" as a proposal. However, in the debate summary, Bloom's point is more of a criticism rather than a proposal. The summary says he opposed the initiative on fiscal grounds, arguing that supporters should fund it themselves. So maybe there's no actual proposal, just a position. But the instructions say if there are no points, return an empty string. However, in this case, there is a position and argument. \n\nSo, the JSON should reflect that. Let me check the example again. The example has \"propSum\" as a proposal. But in Bloom's case, is his statement a proposal? He's saying that those who support it should fund it themselves. That's more of a position than a specific proposal. But maybe the \"propSum\" can be his suggestion. \n\nSo, \"propSum\" would be \"arguing that supporters of the SOLVIT network should fund it themselves rather than using public taxpayer money.\" But the user's example has \"propSum\" as a proposal. However, the user's instructions say to include any proposals or policy actions mentioned. Since Bloom didn't propose a specific policy but made a statement about funding, maybe there's no proposal. But the instructions also say to include positions and arguments. \n\nI need to make sure I don't add anything beyond what's in the debate summary. The summary only mentions his opposition on fiscal grounds. So, the issue is fiscal concerns, position is opposing public funding, argument is fiscal grounds, and there's no specific proposal. But the example includes \"propSum\" even if it's a position. Wait, in the example, \"propSum\" is \"He advocates for strict limitations...\" which is a proposal. \n\nIn Bloom's case, the debate summary says he opposed the initiative on fiscal grounds, arguing that supporters should fund it themselves. So, his position is against public funding, and his argument is fiscal. The proposal would be that supporters should fund it. So \"propSum\" could be \"advocating that supporters of the SOLVIT network should fund it themselves rather than using public taxpayer money.\" \n\nBut the user's example has \"propSum\" as a proposal. So I think that's acceptable here. So the JSON would have:\n\nissueSum: \"Fiscal concerns regarding public funding of the SOLVIT network.\"\npositionSum: \"Opposed the initiative on fiscal grounds, arguing that supporters should fund it themselves rather than using public taxpayer money.\"\nargSum: \"His opposition is based on fiscal grounds, emphasizing that public funds should not be used for the SOLVIT network.\"\npropSum: \"Advocated that supporters of the SOLVIT network should fund it themselves rather than using public taxpayer money.\"\n\nBut I need to check if the debate summary mentions any proposals. The summary says he \"opposed the initiative on fiscal grounds, arguing that 'those who support the SOLVIT network should fund it themselves rather than using public money from taxpayers.'\" So his argument is that funding should come from supporters, not public money. That's a position and argument, but is it a proposal? The user's example includes \"propSum\" as a proposal. So in this case, the proposal would be his suggestion that supporters should fund it. Therefore, the \"propSum\" would be that. \n\nSo the final JSON should include all four fields with the relevant points.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"Fiscal concerns regarding public funding of the SOLVIT network.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"Opposed the initiative on fiscal grounds, arguing that supporters should fund it themselves rather than using public taxpayer money.\",\n\"argSum\": \"His opposition is based on fiscal grounds, emphasizing that public funds should not be used for the SOLVIT network.\",\n\"propSum\": \"Advocated that supporters of the SOLVIT network should fund it themselves rather than using public taxpayer money.\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Adam Jerzy Bielan,", "english": "Adam Jerzy Bielan, on behalf of the UEN Group . \u2013 (PL) Mr\u00a0President, the existence of the internal market opens up tremendous opportunities for the citizens. However, this market often fails to operate as it should. The law is often unclear and incoherent and problems concerning its interpretation arise constantly. As a result, individuals and economic entities have to deal with many obstacles in the course of their activities. The SOLVIT system can be very helpful in such cases.\nThe unquestionable advantage of the network is that it deals with complaints from both citizens and entrepreneurs, and that it is required to find solutions to any problem raised within a short period of time. Another important feature is that SOLVIT is free of charge. Also, according to official statistics, it resolves 75% of the cases it takes on. SOLVIT is a type of instrument which allows the European Union to ascertain whether legislation adopted is being applied appropriately by Member States. A further advantage of the network is that thanks to its negotiating skills, SOLVIT is able to find quicker and far cheaper solutions than the courts could to even the most complicated problems.\nIn order to guarantee high operating standards, SOLVIT has recently introduced a range of improvements to facilitate communication between networks and the individuals or entrepreneurs seeking solutions to their problems. As a result, my constituency office has also been linked to the SOLVIT network. This enables the citizens of my region to bring their problems to my assistants and seek help through us.\nIn view of the SOLVIT network\u2019s success to date, I believe it should be developed further. That is why I fully support the proposal to increase the human resources allocated substantially above the four officials currently assigned to it.\nThere can be no doubt that the concept of the operation of the European SOLVIT system as an instrument to resolve problems within the internal market is a worthy one and deserves strong support. Nonetheless, as politicians responsible for law making, it is incumbent on us to make every effort to create clear, transparent and wise laws. These laws should meet the citizens\u2019 and entrepreneurs\u2019 expectations. They should also foster economic development and the creation of a genuine single market. It is an inspired venture, close to the hearts of the founding fathers of the European Union. Unfortunately, it has not yet been fully developed.\nIn the course of this parliamentary sitting we shall have a good opportunity to make up for lost time where the creation of a single market in services is concerned. We must not give in to public pressure. Instead, we must send out a clear signal that Parliament is determined to create a genuine single market where there will no longer be problems for the SOLVIT programme to resolve.

EU companies and citizens can use SOLVIT to solve problems related to the movement of goods, social security, migration, recognition of qualifications, etc. SOLVIT offers the complainant an opportunity to save time and avoid expensive judicial proceedings. This is particularly relevant for citizens and small, and medium businesses. One of the advantages of SOLVIT is the fact that any periods of prescription applied by courts are suspended.\nAround 800 cases have been registered with the EU's SOLVIT, and of these 80% have been resolved. In the first year of SOLVIT being operational, Lithuania dealt with 10 complaints. Seven of these complaints were directed against Lithuania and three were directed by Lithuania against other states. Citizens made 90% of complaints; the majority about freedom of movement for persons. Lithuania is among those countries where all complaints are resolved on time, on average within 43 days. This is despite the fact that there is only one member of staff working at SOLVIT in Lithuania. However, there are areas of SOLVIT's activities, which may still be improved both in Lithuania and other countries.\nThe small number of SOLVIT cases being processed shows that not only citizens but even some state institutions know little about this system. This is the main obstacle to solving internal market problems through SOLVIT. We must let the public know about the opportunities SOLVIT offers and organise publicity campaigns for citizens and businesses.\nI urge the European Commission to encourage national governments to strengthen SOLVIT's power with more human resources, and urge the Commission itself to support SOLVIT's work financially.", "lang": "LT", "original": "Danut\u0117 Budreikait\u0117 (ALDE). \u2013 Gerbiamas pirmininke, ponios ir ponai, prie\u0161 trejus metus Europos Komisija pasi\u016bl\u0117 SOLVIT priemon\u0119, skirt\u0105 vidaus rinkos taisykli\u0173 pa\u017eeidim\u0173 neteisminiam sprendimui.

The debate summary has several parts: Executive Summary, Current Performance, Resource Concerns, Public Awareness, Proposals, etc. \n\nIn the \"Current Performance and Success\" section, there's a mention of Danut\u0117 Budreikait\u0117 stating that \"Lithuania resolving all complaints within 43 days on average.\" That's a key point about the system's efficiency. Then, in the \"Public Awareness and Promotion\" section, she's quoted as saying \"the low number of cases handled indicates poor awareness rather than lack of need.\" So her main points are about the efficiency of SOLVIT in Lithuania and the need for better public awareness.\n\nI need to structure this into the required JSON fields. The \"issueSum\" should summarize the key issues she raised. The \"positionSum\" would be her stance on those issues. The \"argSum\" is the reasoning behind her positions, and \"propSum\" any proposals she made. \n\nWait, the user said not to include arguments from other speakers. So I need to make sure that only Budreikait\u0117's contributions are included. Let me check again. The summary mentions her in the Current Performance section and Public Awareness section. She didn't make any proposals, just pointed out the average resolution time and the awareness issue. \n\nSo, the issueSum would be about the effectiveness of SOLVIT and public awareness. Her position is that the system works well (as shown by Lithuania's 43-day average) but there's low awareness. The argument is that the low case numbers are due to poor awareness, not lack of need. She didn't propose specific actions, so propSum might be empty. \n\nWait, the example response has propSum even if there's nothing. But the user said if there's no points, respond with empty string. So I need to check if she made any proposals. Looking back, the proposals section mentions others like McCarthy and Wallis, but Budreikait\u0117's quotes are about the average time and awareness. She didn't propose anything herself. So propSum would be an empty string. \n\nTherefore, the JSON should have issueSum about the system's effectiveness and awareness, positionSum stating that Lithuania's success shows effectiveness but awareness is low, argSum explaining that low cases are due to awareness, and propSum as empty.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The effectiveness of the SOLVIT system in resolving cross-border administrative issues and the need to improve public awareness of its availability.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"Danut\u0117 Budreikait\u0117 highlighted Lithuania's efficient resolution of complaints within 43 days, demonstrating SOLVIT's effectiveness, while attributing the low number of cases to poor public awareness rather than systemic failure.\",\n\"argSum\": \"Her argument rests on the premise that the low case volume is not due to a lack of administrative problems but rather a lack of public knowledge about SOLVIT's existence and functionality.\",\n\"propSum\": \"\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Charlie McCreevy,", "english": "Charlie McCreevy, Member of the Commission .

Some may not be impressed by these figures, but high numbers indicate that there are problems and that the single market is not working in some areas. That is certainly not the case; the single market is working, but it needs some assistance here and there through light-touch mechanisms. That is what SOLVIT is. We should not make it a victim of its own success by formalising it or making it heavy-handed. Yes, we must raise awareness that SOLVIT is a way of solving problems. Yes, Member States and the Commission must ensure it is properly resourced, but we should not turn it into something that it is not.\nMy recommendation for SOLVIT is the same as it is for many other issues: namely, keep it simple.", "agenda_item": "SOLVIT (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060213-ITEM-014", "intervention_id": "1-167", "summary_english": "```json\n{\n  \"headline\": \"SOLVIT Success Shows Light-Touch Mechanisms Better Than More Harmonisation for Single Market Problems\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"The speaker addresses practical problems with cross-border business in the single market and the need for effective solutions.

The user provided a debate summary about the SOLVIT network and wants the main points from Charlie McCreevy's speech. First, I need to go through the debate summary carefully.\n\nLooking at the sections, there's an \"Executive Summary\" and various parts like Current Performance, Resource Concerns, etc. The speaker in question is Charlie McCreevy. I need to find all mentions of him in the summary.\n\nIn the \"Current Performance and Success\" section, it says Commissioner Charlie McCreevy highlighted SOLVIT's track record, mentioning that the Commission recommends it as an alternative, fast, and effective way. He also noted the success metrics like 75-80% resolution rates and quick turnaround times. Then, in the \"Proposals for Enhancement\" section, McCreevy announced the Commission's allocation of more resources to the SOLVIT support team, now with five full-time and four part-time staff. Additionally, in the \"Philosophical Approach\" section, he cautioned against over-formalization, advocating to keep it simple.\n\nNow, I need to structure this into the required JSON fields. The issueSum should cover the key issues he mentioned. Since he talked about the system's effectiveness and the need to keep it simple, maybe that's an issue. His positionSum would be his stance on resources and simplicity. The arguments he used are probably based on maintaining effectiveness and avoiding bureaucracy. His proposals include increasing resources and keeping the system simple.\n\nWait, but the user said to only include points attributed to the speaker. So I need to make sure each part is directly from McCreevy. Let me check again. The summary says he highlighted the system's success, mentioned resolution rates, and then in proposals, he announced resource allocation. Also, his caution against formalization. So the issues would be resource allocation and maintaining simplicity. His position is supporting the system's effectiveness and advocating for more resources but not over-formalizing. The arguments are that it's effective and needs to stay simple. Proposals are increasing resources and keeping it simple.\n\nI need to make sure not to include other speakers' points. For example, other speakers talked about public awareness, but McCreevy didn't mention that. So the JSON should only include his points. Let me structure that now.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The effectiveness of the SOLVIT system in resolving cross-border administrative issues and the need to balance resource allocation with simplicity.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"Commissioner McCreevy endorsed SOLVIT as a proven, fast, and effective mechanism, emphasizing the importance of maintaining its simplicity and avoiding over-formalization.\",\n\"argSum\": \"He argued that SOLVIT's success relies on its practical, non-bureaucratic approach and that increased resources should be allocated without compromising its efficiency.\",\n\"propSum\": \"Proposed increasing funding for SOLVIT's support team and maintaining the system's simplicity to ensure continued effectiveness.\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "President.", "english": "President.

The user provided a debate summary about the SOLVIT network and asked about the President's contributions. But wait, the debate summary mentions that there were 10 speakers, but the speaker name given here is \"President.\" However, looking through the provided debate summary, I don't see any mention of a President's speech. The speakers listed include names like Charlie McCreevy, Edit Herczog, Adam Jerzy Bielan, etc., but no President. \n\nThe user's instruction says that if there are no points attributed to the speaker, I should return an empty string. Since the debate summary doesn't mention the President making any contributions, the correct response would be an empty JSON object. I need to make sure that I'm not including any information from other speakers. The user emphasized that only the points from the specified speaker should be included, and if there are none, output an empty string.
