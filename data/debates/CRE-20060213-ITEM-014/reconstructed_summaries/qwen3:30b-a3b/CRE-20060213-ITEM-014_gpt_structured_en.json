SOLVIT shows European citizens a Europe with a human face. As we have heard, the system solved 300 cases in 2004. This is obviously a high number, if we take into account that five senior staff work at SOLVIT, and they found solutions to six difficulties each week. But if we remember that the European Union has a population of 450 million, 300 complaints do not seem to be so many after all. If the citizens visiting the offices of the 732 Members of Parliament would each contact SOLVIT with at least one complaint, this would already cause an insolvable problem. The reason for the relatively few complaints could be that there are few cases causing complaints, but a more likely reason is that few people are aware of this system, and we must expect that in the coming years, as the good reputation of the institution spreads, there will be more and more citizens intending to enforce their consumer protection rights within the SOLVIT system. This means that as the system becomes more and more popular, the workload of SOLVIT will increase, it will become more difficult due to the increasing integration of the internal market, and it will expand with the expansion of consumer culture.\nThis means that it would already be worth considering ways in which we could prepare the system to handle 500, 1 000 or even more requests efficiently, rapidly and pragmatically in five to ten years. This process will need appropriate human and financial resources. We must develop the framework and means of an administrative cooperation that works as efficiently as possible. And we must also think of how this extremely efficient, user friendly European service could be transformed into an equally efficient ingrained habit of Europe, consumers, entrepreneurs and citizens. We must consider the fact that, whichever way we vote on Thursday on the Services Directive, it is absolutely certain that the SOLVIT system will also be required in the area of services.\nTherefore we would like to encourage you, Commissioner, to support the reinforcement of the SOLVIT system and do everything in your power to make the system work.", "lang": "HU", "original": "Edit Herczog, a PSE k\u00e9pvisel\u0151csoport nev\u00e9ben . \u2013 Amikor a fogyaszt\u00f3v\u00e9delemr\u0151l, a v\u00e1llalkoz\u00e1soknak ny\u00fajtott seg\u00edts\u00e9gekr\u0151l vagy egy\u00e1ltal\u00e1n az uni\u00f3s jog terjeszt\u00e9s\u00e9r\u0151l \u00e9s \u00e9rv\u00e9nyre juttat\u00e1s\u00e1r\u00f3l besz\u00e9l\u00fcnk, mindig fontos t\u00f6rekv\u00e9sk\u00e9nt eml\u00edtj\u00fck a hat\u00e9konys\u00e1got, a gyakorlatiass\u00e1got.\nA SOLVIT \u00e9ppen az a rendszer, amely iskolap\u00e9ld\u00e1ja lehet az ilyen c\u00e9lkit\u0171z\u00e9sek megval\u00f3s\u00edt\u00e1s\u00e1nak.

However, this market often fails to operate as it should. The law is often unclear and incoherent and problems concerning its interpretation arise constantly. As a result, individuals and economic entities have to deal with many obstacles in the course of their activities. The SOLVIT system can be very helpful in such cases.\nThe unquestionable advantage of the network is that it deals with complaints from both citizens and entrepreneurs, and that it is required to find solutions to any problem raised within a short period of time. Another important feature is that SOLVIT is free of charge. Also, according to official statistics, it resolves 75% of the cases it takes on. SOLVIT is a type of instrument which allows the European Union to ascertain whether legislation adopted is being applied appropriately by Member States. A further advantage of the network is that thanks to its negotiating skills, SOLVIT is able to find quicker and far cheaper solutions than the courts could to even the most complicated problems.\nIn order to guarantee high operating standards, SOLVIT has recently introduced a range of improvements to facilitate communication between networks and the individuals or entrepreneurs seeking solutions to their problems. As a result, my constituency office has also been linked to the SOLVIT network. This enables the citizens of my region to bring their problems to my assistants and seek help through us.\nIn view of the SOLVIT network\u2019s success to date, I believe it should be developed further. That is why I fully support the proposal to increase the human resources allocated substantially above the four officials currently assigned to it.\nThere can be no doubt that the concept of the operation of the European SOLVIT system as an instrument to resolve problems within the internal market is a worthy one and deserves strong support. Nonetheless, as politicians responsible for law making, it is incumbent on us to make every effort to create clear, transparent and wise laws. These laws should meet the citizens\u2019 and entrepreneurs\u2019 expectations. They should also foster economic development and the creation of a genuine single market. It is an inspired venture, close to the hearts of the founding fathers of the European Union. Unfortunately, it has not yet been fully developed.\nIn the course of this parliamentary sitting we shall have a good opportunity to make up for lost time where the creation of a single market in services is concerned. We must not give in to public pressure. Instead, we must send out a clear signal that Parliament is determined to create a genuine single market where there will no longer be problems for the SOLVIT programme to resolve.

EU companies and citizens can use SOLVIT to solve problems related to the movement of goods, social security, migration, recognition of qualifications, etc. SOLVIT offers the complainant an opportunity to save time and avoid expensive judicial proceedings. This is particularly relevant for citizens and small, and medium businesses. One of the advantages of SOLVIT is the fact that any periods of prescription applied by courts are suspended.\nAround 800 cases have been registered with the EU's SOLVIT, and of these 80% have been resolved. In the first year of SOLVIT being operational, Lithuania dealt with 10 complaints. Seven of these complaints were directed against Lithuania and three were directed by Lithuania against other states. Citizens made 90% of complaints; the majority about freedom of movement for persons. Lithuania is among those countries where all complaints are resolved on time, on average within 43 days. This is despite the fact that there is only one member of staff working at SOLVIT in Lithuania. However, there are areas of SOLVIT's activities, which may still be improved both in Lithuania and other countries.\nThe small number of SOLVIT cases being processed shows that not only citizens but even some state institutions know little about this system. This is the main obstacle to solving internal market problems through SOLVIT. We must let the public know about the opportunities SOLVIT offers and organise publicity campaigns for citizens and businesses.\nI urge the European Commission to encourage national governments to strengthen SOLVIT's power with more human resources, and urge the Commission itself to support SOLVIT's work financially.", "lang": "LT", "original": "Danut\u0117 Budreikait\u0117 (ALDE). \u2013 Gerbiamas pirmininke, ponios ir ponai, prie\u0161 trejus metus Europos Komisija pasi\u016bl\u0117 SOLVIT priemon\u0119, skirt\u0105 vidaus rinkos taisykli\u0173 pa\u017eeidim\u0173 neteisminiam sprendimui.
