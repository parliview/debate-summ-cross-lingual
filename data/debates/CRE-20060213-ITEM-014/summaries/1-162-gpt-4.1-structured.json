{"speaker": "Edit Herczog,", "english": "Edit Herczog, on behalf of the PSE Group . \u2013 (HU) When we talk about consumer protection, assistance granted to enterprises or any aspects of the expansion and enforcement of European Union law, we always mention efficiency and pragmatism as important endeavours.\nSOLVIT is the system that could be a textbook example of the achievement of such objectives. SOLVIT shows European citizens a Europe with a human face. As we have heard, the system solved 300 cases in 2004. This is obviously a high number, if we take into account that five senior staff work at SOLVIT, and they found solutions to six difficulties each week. But if we remember that the European Union has a population of 450 million, 300 complaints do not seem to be so many after all. If the citizens visiting the offices of the 732 Members of Parliament would each contact SOLVIT with at least one complaint, this would already cause an insolvable problem. The reason for the relatively few complaints could be that there are few cases causing complaints, but a more likely reason is that few people are aware of this system, and we must expect that in the coming years, as the good reputation of the institution spreads, there will be more and more citizens intending to enforce their consumer protection rights within the SOLVIT system. This means that as the system becomes more and more popular, the workload of SOLVIT will increase, it will become more difficult due to the increasing integration of the internal market, and it will expand with the expansion of consumer culture.\nThis means that it would already be worth considering ways in which we could prepare the system to handle 500, 1 000 or even more requests efficiently, rapidly and pragmatically in five to ten years. This process will need appropriate human and financial resources. We must develop the framework and means of an administrative cooperation that works as efficiently as possible. And we must also think of how this extremely efficient, user friendly European service could be transformed into an equally efficient ingrained habit of Europe, consumers, entrepreneurs and citizens. We must consider the fact that, whichever way we vote on Thursday on the Services Directive, it is absolutely certain that the SOLVIT system will also be required in the area of services.\nTherefore we would like to encourage you, Commissioner, to support the reinforcement of the SOLVIT system and do everything in your power to make the system work.", "lang": "HU", "original": "Edit Herczog, a PSE k\u00e9pvisel\u0151csoport nev\u00e9ben . \u2013 Amikor a fogyaszt\u00f3v\u00e9delemr\u0151l, a v\u00e1llalkoz\u00e1soknak ny\u00fajtott seg\u00edts\u00e9gekr\u0151l vagy egy\u00e1ltal\u00e1n az uni\u00f3s jog terjeszt\u00e9s\u00e9r\u0151l \u00e9s \u00e9rv\u00e9nyre juttat\u00e1s\u00e1r\u00f3l besz\u00e9l\u00fcnk, mindig fontos t\u00f6rekv\u00e9sk\u00e9nt eml\u00edtj\u00fck a hat\u00e9konys\u00e1got, a gyakorlatiass\u00e1got.\nA SOLVIT \u00e9ppen az a rendszer, amely iskolap\u00e9ld\u00e1ja lehet az ilyen c\u00e9lkit\u0171z\u00e9sek megval\u00f3s\u00edt\u00e1s\u00e1nak.

De ha arra gondolunk, hogy az Uni\u00f3nak 450 milli\u00f3 lakosa van, akkor m\u00e1r nem is olyan sok az a 300 panasz.
