{"speaker": "Arlene McCarthy (PSE),", "english": "Arlene McCarthy (PSE), author . \u2013 It was my predecessor, Philip Whitehead, who tabled this question on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, and I know that he would have wanted to ensure that we support the SOLVIT system and encourage the Commission to refine and develop the problem-solving network on behalf of EU citizens and consumers. That is why we have tabled a number of questions to the Commissioner to assist in further developing and supporting the SOLVIT network.\nI want to share with you the view of a United Kingdom citizen living in the Netherlands who used the SOLVIT system. He said, \u2018SOLVIT is a great service and it should really shout louder about its achievements\u2019. The positive achievements and experiences of our citizens translate into positive attitudes towards Europe, and I believe that our duty as legislators has to be to ensure that the laws we pass are implemented in a way that gives our citizens and consumers the benefits of working, living or doing business in the internal market.\nWhen errors or problems arise in the implementation of EU laws, not only are citizens denied their rights, but the very credibility of the EU as a law-making institution is undermined. SOLVIT is a means of righting these wrongs and assisting national administrations in ensuring the correct implementation and transposition of the legislation that we pass together in the European Union. At the same time, it has the potential to be the customer service face, or the front desk, of the EU law-making process. It can influence people\u2019s perceptions of the EU.\nI have referred constituency cases to the SOLVIT network and have been impressed with how the issues have been handled and with the prompt responses to our questions. One of my constituents had difficulty in having a blue disabled badge issued in Germany: Mrs Nuttall was informed that she had to be a resident in Germany. SOLVIT stepped in and contacted the local German authority, which then issued her with a temporary blue disabled parking badge \u2013 again, that was the EU delivering for citizens.\nAs is indicated in our question, the committee certainly believes that the online problem-solving network can find pragmatic and rapid solutions, which do not have to end up in the courts or as infringement cases. Clearly, however, SOLVIT needs more resources and support, and needs to promote itself and its availability to the public. It needs to make its services better known to libraries, to consumer watchdogs and, of course, to my fellow MEPs, as well as to local authorities, which are often in breach of EU law.\nI believe, as does my constituent, that a revamp of the website is needed, with, where possible, real-life cases that have been solved by SOLVIT. Mr Meehan has said to me that the SOLVIT system could benefit from joint cooperation with Europe Direct. Often he has contacted Europe Direct with questions only to find that it is the SOLVIT staff that have the technical and legal expertise to answer the questions that the public and his citizens need answered.\nThere could well be a strong role for the SOLVIT network in assisting with the implementation of the Services Directive. It could assist in aiding market access for businesses, by supporting the role of the single point of contact for businesses to get into the single market in services, known as the \u2018one-stop shop\u2019.\nThe committee certainly wants to see SOLVIT strengthened. We want to see it better resourced, both in the Commission and at Member State level, and we want to see SOLVIT as a trouble-shooter for citizens and consumers throughout the EU.\nCommissioner, I hope you will take up the issues in the committee\u2019s question.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Arlene McCarthy (PSE), author . \u2013 It was my predecessor, Philip Whitehead, who tabled this question on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, and I know that he would have wanted to ensure that we support the SOLVIT system and encourage the Commission to refine and develop the problem-solving network on behalf of EU citizens and consumers.
