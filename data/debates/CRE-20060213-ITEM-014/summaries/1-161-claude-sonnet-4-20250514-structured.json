My office was privileged to be one of the pilot users of the system, and my staff have been trained on it. We have referred quite a number of complaints to it. We have been extremely gratified by the results, and the people we have helped have also been pleased. I would like to associate myself very fully indeed with the tone of this question, but I think that there are a number of points that flow from it, because the resources that it needs are not just at Commission level as you, Commissioner, pointed out. We also have to get the Member States to put the resources in and gear up their activities.\nI want to take this opportunity to thank publicly the very hard-working UK staff of SOLVIT in the Department of Trade and Industry who have been extremely helpful to my staff in pursuing a very wide range of complaints. I am sure that other countries have had the same experience. But, Commissioner, you need to put pressure on the Member States as well. As you said, it is the change of culture that is going to be absolutely vital in this respect.\nI also want to support very much what you said about the evolution of this type of combination of technology and process \u2013 using the technology to cut through the bureaucracy \u2013 because we hope and we are sure, in fact, that we will need this as the internal market for services develops. I am increasingly certain that we will improve this with a substantial majority this week, but we want to get on with that. There are new cooperative provisions in there, there will be new small businesses accessing the single market and all of them will need access to SOLVIT if we really are going to get the economic benefits that the single market promises.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Malcolm Harbour, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . \u2013 Mr President, I very much welcome this question.
