EU companies and citizens can use SOLVIT to solve problems related to the movement of goods, social security, migration, recognition of qualifications, etc. SOLVIT offers the complainant an opportunity to save time and avoid expensive judicial proceedings. This is particularly relevant for citizens and small, and medium businesses. One of the advantages of SOLVIT is the fact that any periods of prescription applied by courts are suspended.\nAround 800 cases have been registered with the EU's SOLVIT, and of these 80% have been resolved. In the first year of SOLVIT being operational, Lithuania dealt with 10 complaints. Seven of these complaints were directed against Lithuania and three were directed by Lithuania against other states. Citizens made 90% of complaints; the majority about freedom of movement for persons. Lithuania is among those countries where all complaints are resolved on time, on average within 43 days. This is despite the fact that there is only one member of staff working at SOLVIT in Lithuania. However, there are areas of SOLVIT's activities, which may still be improved both in Lithuania and other countries.\nThe small number of SOLVIT cases being processed shows that not only citizens but even some state institutions know little about this system. This is the main obstacle to solving internal market problems through SOLVIT. We must let the public know about the opportunities SOLVIT offers and organise publicity campaigns for citizens and businesses.\nI urge the European Commission to encourage national governments to strengthen SOLVIT's power with more human resources, and urge the Commission itself to support SOLVIT's work financially.", "lang": "LT", "original": "Danut\u0117 Budreikait\u0117 (ALDE). \u2013 Gerbiamas pirmininke, ponios ir ponai, prie\u0161 trejus metus Europos Komisija pasi\u016bl\u0117 SOLVIT priemon\u0119, skirt\u0105 vidaus rinkos taisykli\u0173 pa\u017eeidim\u0173 neteisminiam sprendimui.
