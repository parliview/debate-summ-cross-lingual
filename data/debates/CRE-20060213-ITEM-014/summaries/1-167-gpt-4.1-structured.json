Some practical suggestions and ideas were put forward, particularly by Mrs McCarthy, which I have taken up with my services.\nSOLVIT is about making the single market work. We often hear calls for more single market, more harmonisation. That seems to many to be the answer to all problems. I do not believe that more directives and more harmonisation are the only solutions. Indeed, they may even be part of the problem. If there is a practical problem with doing business across borders, it needs a practical solution. Legal proceedings or regulation are rarely a practical solution, but SOLVIT is. It allows the parties to the problem and the national administrations to communicate effectively and to find a solution in a matter of weeks. Our businesses and consumers need an answer and a solution. Systems such as SOLVIT contribute to that.\nSOLVIT has been a success. Hundreds of problems have been solved through it. Some may not be impressed by these figures, but high numbers indicate that there are problems and that the single market is not working in some areas. That is certainly not the case; the single market is working, but it needs some assistance here and there through light-touch mechanisms. That is what SOLVIT is. We should not make it a victim of its own success by formalising it or making it heavy-handed. Yes, we must raise awareness that SOLVIT is a way of solving problems. Yes, Member States and the Commission must ensure it is properly resourced, but we should not turn it into something that it is not.\nMy recommendation for SOLVIT is the same as it is for many other issues: namely, keep it simple.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Charlie McCreevy, Member of the Commission .
