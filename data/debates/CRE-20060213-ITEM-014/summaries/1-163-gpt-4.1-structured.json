{"speaker": "Diana Wallis,", "english": "Diana Wallis, on behalf of the ALDE Group . \u2013 Mr President, this is indeed a special question, and it is good that it represents the continuity between our former chairman, Mr Whitehead, and Mrs McCarthy.\nWhen the SOLVIT system works it makes the internal market work. It has been a success: it delivers positive outcomes; it has practical effects both for SMEs and others trying to make the internal market work. It deals mainly with administrative problems. But I, like others, have had many positive experiences in referring constituents to SOLVIT and seeing them come away as satisfied customers.\nHowever, the question certainly points out the problems: resources and publicity. If there is a good service there, then we surely need to tell more people about it; and if resources are needed and the problems are at Member State level, we need to try and address that.\nBut I want to draw attention to something else. Last week I had the opportunity to speak at a meeting hosted by the Commission of consumer representatives from consumer bureaux across the European Union. It is quite clear that there are still enormous problems in satisfying the cross-border difficulties that consumers encounter. I believe that we could do more to extend the SOLVIT-type system to these sorts of problems. The SOLVIT system is, after all, simple, pragmatic and practical \u2013 surely an example of the best sort of thing we do, rather than being overly legalistic. It shows the EU can deliver added value that gives practical effect to our citizens, to make our internal market work for the best. Let us take it further, if we can, by extending it more into the area of consumers, and not just that of administrative problems.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Diana Wallis, on behalf of the ALDE Group . \u2013 Mr President, this is indeed a special question, and it is good that it represents the continuity between our former chairman, Mr Whitehead, and Mrs McCarthy.\nWhen the SOLVIT system works it makes the internal market work.
