In any event, many arguments have been taken into account, and this Directive does represent progress.

I also feel that there is room for further reflection on the development of health and safety protection at work. In conclusion, I consider that the process represented a step in the right direction and I assume, on the basis of this debate, that the Directive will gain resounding support.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Vladim\u00edr \u0160pidla, Member of the Commission .
