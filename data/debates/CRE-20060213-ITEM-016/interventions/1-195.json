Many congratulations are thus due to our Parliament\u2019s delegation, including the rapporteur, Mr \u0150ry, for the successful outcome of the conciliation procedure.\nOptical radiation arising from artificial sources may, under certain circumstances, cause exposed workers serious eye trauma \u2013 including blindness \u2013 or severe skin damage, including cancer initiation. This legislation, if properly implemented, will undoubtedly help reduce the chance of such occurrences and will protect many workers from the perils of yet another work-related risk.\nHowever, we must not forget that the biggest source of optical radiation is not artificial radiation but the sun, and for most workers skin cancer occurs as a result of exposure to the sun. Therefore, at some stage in the future, we have to face this problem and deal with it successfully.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Marios Matsakis (ALDE). \u2013 Mr President, with the vote tomorrow on this directive on the protection of workers from the risks arising from exposure to optical radiation, the EU legislation stipulating minimum health and safety requirements for workers exposed to physical agents will come to a much-awaited and much-needed fulfilment.\nIt is true that this particular proposal proved rather difficult to bring to a finalisation agreement, but thanks to the perseverance and the common-sense approach exhibited by all involved in the conciliation process, all the hurdles were overcome.
