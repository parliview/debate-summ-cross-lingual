I believe we now have a reasonable decision from conciliation. It is a sensible and workable decision, through which we have limited the scope of this directive. However, we will still ensure that workers exposed to optical radiation will be fully protected and that their health and safety will be looked after.\nAs far as natural radiation is concerned, risks must be pointed out and reasonable precautions must be taken, but Member States should have the responsibility for drawing up the action plan, and that should give legal certainty to workers and employers in different countries. However powerful we may consider ourselves to be in this Parliament, we cannot legislate for sunshine or rain across 25 Member States. In Ireland, partly because of our own inaction and through our own fault, we currently have a nitrates directive based on rainfall, weather and climate, which is totally unworkable, but that is another story.\nIn this situation and with this directive, we have struck a balance. We have avoided over-regulation and excessive bureaucracy and come forward with a piece of legislation that is reasonable and workable and which protects workers.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Marian Harkin (ALDE). \u2013 Mr President, firstly I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on a piece of very good work.
