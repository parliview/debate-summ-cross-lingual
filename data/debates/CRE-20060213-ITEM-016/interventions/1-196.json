(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I have listened with interest to your debate and I am happy to note the broad support for the proposal that emerged from the conciliation process. I should like to thank all those who took part in that process, because it was not a smooth ride and in a number of cases it proved very difficult to reach a decent compromise. In any event, many arguments have been taken into account, and this Directive does represent progress. I believe that none of the ideas expressed in this debate can easily be rebuffed with a simple argument. I also feel that there is room for further reflection on the development of health and safety protection at work. In conclusion, I consider that the process represented a step in the right direction and I assume, on the basis of this debate, that the Directive will gain resounding support.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Vladim\u00edr \u0160pidla, Member of the Commission .
