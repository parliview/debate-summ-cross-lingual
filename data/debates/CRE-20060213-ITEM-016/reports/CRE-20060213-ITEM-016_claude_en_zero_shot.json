Section 16 of the Framework Directive stipulates that individual directives must be created to address risks of various types. These are required because such regulations would allow for a more accurate adaptation of the general stipulations of the Framework Directive to specific situations. The adaptation of the content of general obligations to individual risk types is very much in the interest of employees and employers, because this is how the law of the European Union can be implemented in practice, and it can create competition neutrality and guarantee greater safety. If the content of the obligations is not unequivocal, employers will have difficulty proving that they did comply with the provisions of the law, which may lead to legal disputes of unpredictable outcomes. It is also in the employees' interest that the protection in the area of health and safety at work, which is the inalienable right of each European citizen, as stipulated in Section 137 of the Treaty of Rome, should be implemented through efficient articles of law that are easy to apply in practice.\nThe preparation of individual directives has been ongoing for the past decade and a half. The Directive on Optical Radiation is meant to cover the fourth extremely important area after noise, mechanical vibrations and electromagnetic radiation. As originally envisaged by the European Commission and Council, this fourth directive would have addressed the treatment of optical radiation originating from both natural and artificial sources. However, there are some significant differences between these two areas, in terms of intervention and risk level reduction. Therefore, during the debate of the second reading of the Directive, the European Parliament passed on to Member States the entire regulatory competence regarding solar radiation risks. However, it was subsequently found that this decision violated certain European Union competences, as it would have prevented the application of the stipulation contained in Section 137 of the Treaty of Rome, which stated that the minimum level of requirements applicable in the area of health and safety at work should be set within EU frameworks, for each risk type. This was why the Council and the Commission were unable to accept the decision of Parliament taken at second reading, and a reconciliation procedure followed. In the course of the reconciliation procedure, the Council accepted the majority of the amendments made by Parliament, and only suggested two substantive and two formal alterations. The most important substantive amendment suggested that the scope of the Directive should not include optical radiation from natural sources, as the foundations of a pan-European agreement for setting minimum EU requirements in this area had not yet been laid down.\nHowever, legislators are not disputing any of the issues concerning artificial radiation, and it would be expedient to introduce the individual directive providing precise regulation in this area right now, this year. The Parliamentary Delegation accepted these arguments, but in all other issues the Council accepted the position of the European Parliament. Consequently, it was the wording proposed by the Parliamentary Delegation that was included in Section 8 concerning medical surveillance, and in the relevant preamble paragraph. We can say that the reconciliation procedure was rapid and successful beyond our expectations, and a final agreement was reached as early as December 2005.\nConsequently, this is what I would like to ask my colleagues and Parliament to support during the voting.", "lang": "HU", "original": "Csaba \u0150ry (PPE-DE), el\u0151ad\u00f3 . \u2013 Engedj\u00e9k meg, hogy r\u00f6viden \u00f6sszefoglaljam ennek a bonyolult jogalkot\u00e1si elj\u00e1r\u00e1snak a f\u0151bb \u00e1llom\u00e1sait, amelynek eredm\u00e9nyek\u00e9nt most harmadik olvasatban t\u00e1rgyalhatjuk az optikai sug\u00e1rz\u00e1sokr\u00f3l sz\u00f3l\u00f3 ir\u00e1nyelvet.\nA folyamat kiindul\u00e1si pontj\u00e1t a 89/391/EGK keretir\u00e1nyelv jelentette, amely \u00e1tfog\u00f3an szab\u00e1lyozta a munkahelyi biztons\u00e1g \u00e9s eg\u00e9szs\u00e9gv\u00e9delem eg\u00e9sz ter\u00fclet\u00e9t, \u00e9s a munkahelyen el\u0151fordul\u00f3 minden lehets\u00e9ges kock\u00e1zat tekintet\u00e9ben megteremtette egy egys\u00e9ges megk\u00f6zel\u00edt\u00e9s jogi kereteit.

I think he has done an excellent job of work. This directive will benefit workers exposed to risks from artificial sources of optical radiation in a wide range of working environments: everything from electric arc welders to workers using advanced industrial lasers.\nWhen I was rapporteur at first reading on this proposal well over ten years ago, the use of industrial lasers was pretty much in its infancy, but now they are very widespread and exposing workers to varying degrees of risk. It is a useful piece of legislation and again I would like to say \u2018well done\u2019 to the rapporteur.\nI have to say, however, that he produced good work despite, rather than because of, the help of his own group. At one time this institution took its work on health and safety subjects very seriously, but a rather worrying trend has developed in relation to recent directives. When we dealt, for example, with the directive on vibration, we were told that we must exclude whole-body vibration because \u2013 and this was used in the tabloid press \u2013 what we were trying to do was to prevent farmers from driving their tractors for more than three or four hours even at the height of the harvest, which was nonsense. When we dealt with the noise directive we were told that we must exclude music and entertainment because what we were trying to do was to force members of orchestras to wear Mickey Mouse ear protectors and that we were about to ban the use of the bagpipes in Scotland. Again nonsense, but it grabbed the tabloid headlines.\nIn this proposal we have had a determined push by a number of Members in the rapporteur\u2019s group and elsewhere to exclude a particular phenomenon from the scope of the directive. They pushed for that without realising that the risks arising from this phenomenon are clearly covered in the placing of clear obligations on employers by two earlier directives: the framework directive and the directive on temporary and mobile work sites. The phenomenon I am talking about is, of course, natural radiation.\nThe rapporteur made a valiant effort and we tried to help him to give legal certainty to employers when it comes to solar radiation. They are now lacking that legal certainty and still have the full implications of the framework directive and temporary mobile work sites directive to deal with. Hopefully, common sense will prevail at Member State level, as it has so far. That would mean, for example, that a travel agency in my region could quickly discount the risk for employees working indoors in its shops in the north of England, but that it had better take very seriously the risk facing its staff acting as company representatives in Mediterranean resorts throughout the summer months.\nThat is the difficulty now facing employers. We have not given them legal certainty. We will have a number of more difficult cases to assess for employers between those two extremes that I have given as an example. I hope that in future we can again focus on producing good, serious health and safety legislation and not on producing tabloid headlines."}, {"speaker": "Elizabeth Lynne,", "english": "Elizabeth Lynne, on behalf of the ALDE Group . \u2013 Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur for his cooperation.

I should like to begin by saying that I am, of course, in favour of this proposed legislation. I am disappointed, however, with the outcome of the conciliation process, and in particular the role played by Parliament. The negotiations on this Directive, which is sometimes referred to as the sunlight exposure directive, have instead been more reminiscent of a second-rate soap opera. Initially, the experts, the European institutions and the Member States agreed that it would be necessary to add further legislation to the general regulation on health and safety at work that would have simplified the legislation on protection from optical radiation and made it workable. Similar legislation was adopted in the previous period, in relation to noise, vibrations and electromagnetic radiation. What is more, nobody has referred to the very modest limit values for exposure to optical radiation, as set out in the annex to the proposed Directive.\nThe rapporteur, Mr \u0150ry, has shown tremendous determination and I should like to congratulate him for seeking a compromise. Nevertheless, it was his political group that had opposed the inclusion of all natural sources of optical radiation in this Directive. It strikes me as rather absurd that fierce opposition to clearly defined rules and standards for informing workers and protecting them against sunlight radiation has come principally from those Member States in which there is already a decent level of protection, whereas countries such as Italy, where much greater effort is required, did not raise any fundamental objections. Perhaps the Italians know, in short, that information on and prevention of illness at work is cheaper for workers than doing nothing.\nThe Directive on optical radiation would be a practical step, bringing not only improvements in the protection of the workers, but also a simplification of European legislation.

I should like to begin by saying that I am, of course, in favour of this proposed legislation. I am disappointed, however, with the outcome of the conciliation process, and in particular the role played by Parliament. The negotiations on this Directive, which is sometimes referred to as the sunlight exposure directive, have instead been more reminiscent of a second-rate soap opera. Initially, the experts, the European institutions and the Member States agreed that it would be necessary to add further legislation to the general regulation on health and safety at work that would have simplified the legislation on protection from optical radiation and made it workable. Similar legislation was adopted in the previous period, in relation to noise, vibrations and electromagnetic radiation. What is more, nobody has referred to the very modest limit values for exposure to optical radiation, as set out in the annex to the proposed Directive.\nThe rapporteur, Mr \u0150ry, has shown tremendous determination and I should like to congratulate him for seeking a compromise. Nevertheless, it was his political group that had opposed the inclusion of all natural sources of optical radiation in this Directive. It strikes me as rather absurd that fierce opposition to clearly defined rules and standards for informing workers and protecting them against sunlight radiation has come principally from those Member States in which there is already a decent level of protection, whereas countries such as Italy, where much greater effort is required, did not raise any fundamental objections. Perhaps the Italians know, in short, that information on and prevention of illness at work is cheaper for workers than doing nothing.\nThe Directive on optical radiation would be a practical step, bringing not only improvements in the protection of the workers, but also a simplification of European legislation. The situation that confronts us today in this area is far from what I would consider a reduction in unnecessary bureaucracy.

Debate Information\n\n**Date:** February 13, 2006  \n**Topic:** Exposure of workers to optical radiation (debate)  \n**Number of Contributions:** 17 speakers  \n**Context:** Third reading debate on a directive concerning minimum health and safety requirements regarding worker exposure to artificial optical radiation, following conciliation committee proceedings\n\n## 2. Executive Summary\n\nThis debate centered on a controversial EU directive to protect workers from optical radiation exposure, with the primary dispute focusing on whether natural radiation (sunlight) should be included alongside artificial sources like lasers and welding equipment.\n\n### Key Positions and Arguments\n\n**Rapporteur Csaba \u0150ry (PPE-DE)** presented the compromise reached through conciliation, supporting the final directive limited to artificial optical radiation only. He explained that \"the Parliamentary Delegation accepted these arguments, but in all other issues the Council accepted the position of the European Parliament\" [\u0150ry, 2006-02-13]. The exclusion of natural radiation occurred because \"the foundations of a pan-European agreement for setting minimum EU requirements in this area had not yet been laid down\" [\u0150ry, 2006-02-13].\n\n**Commissioner Vladim\u00edr \u0160pidla** welcomed the balanced outcome, stating \"The Commission is pleased that this directive complies entirely with the acquis communautaire in the area of protecting the health and safety of workers whilst ensuring the flexibility and proportionality required for businesses to be competitive\" [\u0160pidla, 2006-02-13]. He emphasized that the directive represents progress while maintaining business competitiveness.\n\n### The Natural Radiation Controversy\n\n**Conservative and Liberal Opposition:** Thomas Mann (PPE-DE) and Elizabeth Lynne (ALDE) celebrated removing sunlight regulations, arguing they represented EU overregulation. Mann questioned whether \"building workers be allowed to work in the open air only with protective headgear and long shirts\" and whether \"waitresses in beer gardens have to cover up their decollet\u00e9\" [Mann, 2006-02-13]. Lynne declared it \"a victory for common sense,\" arguing \"once people have been given the information, we are adults and should be able to make up our own minds. It should not be left to the employer to enforce it\" [Lynne, 2006-02-13].\n\nAnja Weisgerber (PPE-DE) called the original sunlight provisions \"a masterpiece of European over-regulation,\" arguing \"any sane person is the best judge of when and how they should protect themselves against the sun. It is all about personal responsibility\" [Weisgerber, 2006-02-13].\n\n**Social Democrat Concerns:** Stephen Hughes (PSE) and Karin J\u00f6ns (PSE) criticized the exclusion of natural radiation. Hughes warned that \"employers are still uncertain of where they stand, legally speaking, as regards whether they need to take steps to protect workers from hazardous natural radiation\" [Hughes, 2006-02-13]. J\u00f6ns explained that Social Democrats \"want the minimum standards that we lay down for health protection in the workplace to be applied equally and across the board in all the Member States\" rather than \"an \u00e0 la carte Europe\" [J\u00f6ns, 2006-02-13].\n\n### Economic and Practical Concerns\n\n**Business Cost Arguments:** Several speakers emphasized avoiding excessive regulatory burden on businesses. However, Sepp Kusstatscher (Verts/ALE) challenged this approach, asking \"Why should people in general cough up for the costs that business imposes on public health services simply because of the negligent attitude taken towards certain risks?\" [Kusstatscher, 2006-02-13].\n\n**Implementation Challenges:** Multiple speakers highlighted practical difficulties with EU-wide natural radiation regulation. Marian Harkin (ALDE) observed that \"However powerful we may consider ourselves to be in this Parliament, we cannot legislate for sunshine or rain across 25 Member States\" [Harkin, 2006-02-13].\n\n### Future Implications\n\nSeveral speakers acknowledged ongoing challenges. Ji\u0159\u00ed Ma\u0161t\u00e1lka (GUE/NGL) warned that \"legal disputes will be unavoidable\" due to the compromise [Ma\u0161t\u00e1lka, 2006-02-13]. Marios Matsakis (ALDE) noted that while supporting the current directive, \"the biggest source of optical radiation is not artificial radiation but the sun, and for most workers skin cancer occurs as a result of exposure to the sun. Therefore, at some stage in the future, we have to face this problem\" [Matsakis, 2006-02-13].\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe debate revealed fundamental tensions between comprehensive worker protection, business flexibility, and appropriate EU regulatory scope. While achieving consensus on artificial optical radiation protection, the exclusion of natural sources left unresolved legal uncertainties and philosophical divisions about the proper balance between individual responsibility and regulatory protection.
