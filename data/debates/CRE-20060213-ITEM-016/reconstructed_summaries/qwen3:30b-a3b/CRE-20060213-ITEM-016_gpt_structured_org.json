Section 16 of the Framework Directive stipulates that individual directives must be created to address risks of various types. These are required because such regulations would allow for a more accurate adaptation of the general stipulations of the Framework Directive to specific situations. The adaptation of the content of general obligations to individual risk types is very much in the interest of employees and employers, because this is how the law of the European Union can be implemented in practice, and it can create competition neutrality and guarantee greater safety. If the content of the obligations is not unequivocal, employers will have difficulty proving that they did comply with the provisions of the law, which may lead to legal disputes of unpredictable outcomes. It is also in the employees' interest that the protection in the area of health and safety at work, which is the inalienable right of each European citizen, as stipulated in Section 137 of the Treaty of Rome, should be implemented through efficient articles of law that are easy to apply in practice.\nThe preparation of individual directives has been ongoing for the past decade and a half. The Directive on Optical Radiation is meant to cover the fourth extremely important area after noise, mechanical vibrations and electromagnetic radiation. As originally envisaged by the European Commission and Council, this fourth directive would have addressed the treatment of optical radiation originating from both natural and artificial sources. However, there are some significant differences between these two areas, in terms of intervention and risk level reduction. Therefore, during the debate of the second reading of the Directive, the European Parliament passed on to Member States the entire regulatory competence regarding solar radiation risks. However, it was subsequently found that this decision violated certain European Union competences, as it would have prevented the application of the stipulation contained in Section 137 of the Treaty of Rome, which stated that the minimum level of requirements applicable in the area of health and safety at work should be set within EU frameworks, for each risk type. This was why the Council and the Commission were unable to accept the decision of Parliament taken at second reading, and a reconciliation procedure followed. In the course of the reconciliation procedure, the Council accepted the majority of the amendments made by Parliament, and only suggested two substantive and two formal alterations. The most important substantive amendment suggested that the scope of the Directive should not include optical radiation from natural sources, as the foundations of a pan-European agreement for setting minimum EU requirements in this area had not yet been laid down.\nHowever, legislators are not disputing any of the issues concerning artificial radiation, and it would be expedient to introduce the individual directive providing precise regulation in this area right now, this year. The Parliamentary Delegation accepted these arguments, but in all other issues the Council accepted the position of the European Parliament. Consequently, it was the wording proposed by the Parliamentary Delegation that was included in Section 8 concerning medical surveillance, and in the relevant preamble paragraph. We can say that the reconciliation procedure was rapid and successful beyond our expectations, and a final agreement was reached as early as December 2005.\nConsequently, this is what I would like to ask my colleagues and Parliament to support during the voting.", "lang": "HU", "original": "Csaba \u0150ry (PPE-DE), el\u0151ad\u00f3 . \u2013 Engedj\u00e9k meg, hogy r\u00f6viden \u00f6sszefoglaljam ennek a bonyolult jogalkot\u00e1si elj\u00e1r\u00e1snak a f\u0151bb \u00e1llom\u00e1sait, amelynek eredm\u00e9nyek\u00e9nt most harmadik olvasatban t\u00e1rgyalhatjuk az optikai sug\u00e1rz\u00e1sokr\u00f3l sz\u00f3l\u00f3 ir\u00e1nyelvet.\nA folyamat kiindul\u00e1si pontj\u00e1t a 89/391/EGK keretir\u00e1nyelv jelentette, amely \u00e1tfog\u00f3an szab\u00e1lyozta a munkahelyi biztons\u00e1g \u00e9s eg\u00e9szs\u00e9gv\u00e9delem eg\u00e9sz ter\u00fclet\u00e9t, \u00e9s a munkahelyen el\u0151fordul\u00f3 minden lehets\u00e9ges kock\u00e1zat tekintet\u00e9ben megteremtette egy egys\u00e9ges megk\u00f6zel\u00edt\u00e9s jogi kereteit.

Looking at the \"Proponents of Restricting the Directive to Artificial Radiation\" section, there's a mention of him. The summary states that he argued the directive's scope shouldn't include natural sources like sunlight because there's no EU-wide consensus. He supports detailed rules for artificial radiation, citing legal certainty for employers and real worker protection. Also, he mentions that there's no legislative dispute in this area, so an individual directive for artificial sources is advisable now.\n\nNow, I need to structure the response into the four categories: issueSum, positionSum, argSum, propSum. \n\nFor issueSum, the key issue is the scope of the directive, specifically excluding natural sources. \n\nPositionSum should reflect his stance on restricting the directive to artificial radiation. \n\nArgSum would be the reasons he gives, like lack of consensus and avoiding unnecessary bureaucracy. \n\nPropSum would be his proposal to focus on artificial sources. \n\nI need to make sure not to include other speakers' points.

The user provided a detailed debate summary about the EU directive on worker exposure to optical radiation. The task is to outline the main points of Sepp Kusstatscher based on the given data.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the debate summary and find all mentions of Sepp Kusstatscher. In the \"Proponents of a Broader Directive\" section, there's a quote from him. The key points here are his call for EU-wide minimum standards and his opposition to diluting health protections due to cost concerns. He also mentions that he doesn't understand why health protection should cost nothing if the rules are the same for all, which prevents unfair competition.\n\nSo, the issue he's addressing is the need for consistent EU-wide standards despite cost concerns. His position is in favor of comprehensive regulations, including natural radiation, and he's against reducing health protections for economic reasons. The argument here is that uniform rules prevent unfair competition. His proposal is to maintain health protections without compromising on standards.\n\nI need to make sure I don't include other speakers' points. The user specified that only Sepp Kusstatscher's contributions should be considered. The response should be in JSON format with the four fields: issueSum, positionSum, argSum, propSum.

I should like to begin by saying that I am, of course, in favour of this proposed legislation. I am disappointed, however, with the outcome of the conciliation process, and in particular the role played by Parliament. The negotiations on this Directive, which is sometimes referred to as the sunlight exposure directive, have instead been more reminiscent of a second-rate soap opera. Initially, the experts, the European institutions and the Member States agreed that it would be necessary to add further legislation to the general regulation on health and safety at work that would have simplified the legislation on protection from optical radiation and made it workable. Similar legislation was adopted in the previous period, in relation to noise, vibrations and electromagnetic radiation. What is more, nobody has referred to the very modest limit values for exposure to optical radiation, as set out in the annex to the proposed Directive.\nThe rapporteur, Mr \u0150ry, has shown tremendous determination and I should like to congratulate him for seeking a compromise. Nevertheless, it was his political group that had opposed the inclusion of all natural sources of optical radiation in this Directive. It strikes me as rather absurd that fierce opposition to clearly defined rules and standards for informing workers and protecting them against sunlight radiation has come principally from those Member States in which there is already a decent level of protection, whereas countries such as Italy, where much greater effort is required, did not raise any fundamental objections. Perhaps the Italians know, in short, that information on and prevention of illness at work is cheaper for workers than doing nothing.\nThe Directive on optical radiation would be a practical step, bringing not only improvements in the protection of the workers, but also a simplification of European legislation. The situation that confronts us today in this area is far from what I would consider a reduction in unnecessary bureaucracy.

It would also have entailed liabilities of which employers would have been unaware, and, in any case, any sane person is the best judge of when and how they should protect themselves against the sun. It is all about personal responsibility and is pretty much the last thing that Europe should be laying down the law about.\nEurope has quite different problems to deal with, in the shape of unemployment, exhausted social security systems and more and more aged people among the population. Those are the things we need to worry about, not protection from sunlight. Even the Commission and the Council have come to their senses and recognised this in the course of the conciliation procedure, and I am very glad that they have. It has made possible a considerable improvement in the directive and prevented over-regulation that would have resulted in needless additional expense, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises.\nI urge you to vote, tomorrow, in favour of the Conciliation Committee\u2019s proposal, and then we will flag up our desire for less bureaucracy and less red tape throughout Europe.", "lang": "DE", "original": "Anja Weisgerber (PPE-DE). \u2013 Herr Pr\u00e4sident, liebe Kolleginnen und Kollegen!

The process that has brought this change of thinking has been a long and laborious one, beginning with sympathy for the workers, followed by the realisation that employers had a duty of care, and that suffering and illness can be alleviated through treatment.
