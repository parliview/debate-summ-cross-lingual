Let me start by reading through the entire summary carefully.\n\nThe debate is about the European Parliament's third reading of a directive on worker exposure to artificial optical radiation. The main points discussed include the exclusion of natural radiation like sunlight from the directive, political divisions, and various arguments from different speakers. \n\nThe user is asking about the President's contributions. Let me scan through the summary to find any mentions of the President. The summary has sections like \"Rapporteur's Position,\" \"Commission Support,\" \"Conservative/Liberal Opposition,\" \"Social Democrat and Left Criticism,\" \"Economic and Implementation Concerns,\" \"Medical Perspective,\" and \"Conclusion.\" \n\nLooking through each section:\n\n- The Rapporteur is Csaba \u0150ry (PPE-DE), who presented the compromise.\n- Commissioner Vladim\u00edr \u0160pidla supported the directive.\n- Thomas Mann, Elizabeth Lynne, Anja Weisgerber are from PPE-DE and ALDE, opposing natural radiation regulation.\n- Stephen Hughes, Karin J\u00f6ns, Ji\u0159\u00ed Ma\u0161t\u00e1lka are from PSE and GUE/NGL, criticizing the exclusion.\n- Sepp Kusstatscher (Verts/ALE) and Marian Harkin (ALDE) have their points.\n- Marios Matsakis (ALDE) mentions the medical aspect.\n- The Conclusion mentions Commissioner \u0160pidla's statement.\n\nWait, the President of the European Parliament is usually a separate role. In the summary, is there any mention of the President? Let me check again. The sections mention speakers like Csaba \u0150ry, Vladim\u00edr \u0160pidla (Commissioner), Thomas Mann, Elizabeth Lynne, etc. The conclusion mentions Commissioner \u0160pidla's statement. \n\nBut the user is asking about the President. In the debate, the President might be the person presiding over the session, but in the summary provided, there's no specific mention of the President's statements. The summary includes interventions from speakers, but the President's role is typically to manage the debate, not to make arguments. \n\nLooking through the entire text again, I don't see any direct quotes or mentions of the President's contributions. The summary includes the rapporteur, commissioners, and other members, but not the President. Therefore, the answer would be an empty string because there are no points attributed to the President in the provided debate summary.\n</think>\n\n\"", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Csaba \u0150ry (PPE-DE),", "english": "Csaba \u0150ry (PPE-DE), rapporteur . \u2013 (HU) Please allow me to briefly summarise the main stages of this complicated legislative procedure, as a result of which we can now debate the third reading of the Directive on Optical Radiation.\nThe procedure started with Framework Directive 89/391/EEC, which provided a comprehensive regulation for the entire issue of health and safety at work, and created the legal framework for a single approach to all possible risks that may arise at the workplace. Section 16 of the Framework Directive stipulates that individual directives must be created to address risks of various types. These are required because such regulations would allow for a more accurate adaptation of the general stipulations of the Framework Directive to specific situations. The adaptation of the content of general obligations to individual risk types is very much in the interest of employees and employers, because this is how the law of the European Union can be implemented in practice, and it can create competition neutrality and guarantee greater safety. If the content of the obligations is not unequivocal, employers will have difficulty proving that they did comply with the provisions of the law, which may lead to legal disputes of unpredictable outcomes. It is also in the employees' interest that the protection in the area of health and safety at work, which is the inalienable right of each European citizen, as stipulated in Section 137 of the Treaty of Rome, should be implemented through efficient articles of law that are easy to apply in practice.\nThe preparation of individual directives has been ongoing for the past decade and a half. The Directive on Optical Radiation is meant to cover the fourth extremely important area after noise, mechanical vibrations and electromagnetic radiation. As originally envisaged by the European Commission and Council, this fourth directive would have addressed the treatment of optical radiation originating from both natural and artificial sources. However, there are some significant differences between these two areas, in terms of intervention and risk level reduction. Therefore, during the debate of the second reading of the Directive, the European Parliament passed on to Member States the entire regulatory competence regarding solar radiation risks. However, it was subsequently found that this decision violated certain European Union competences, as it would have prevented the application of the stipulation contained in Section 137 of the Treaty of Rome, which stated that the minimum level of requirements applicable in the area of health and safety at work should be set within EU frameworks, for each risk type. This was why the Council and the Commission were unable to accept the decision of Parliament taken at second reading, and a reconciliation procedure followed. In the course of the reconciliation procedure, the Council accepted the majority of the amendments made by Parliament, and only suggested two substantive and two formal alterations. The most important substantive amendment suggested that the scope of the Directive should not include optical radiation from natural sources, as the foundations of a pan-European agreement for setting minimum EU requirements in this area had not yet been laid down.\nHowever, legislators are not disputing any of the issues concerning artificial radiation, and it would be expedient to introduce the individual directive providing precise regulation in this area right now, this year. The Parliamentary Delegation accepted these arguments, but in all other issues the Council accepted the position of the European Parliament. Consequently, it was the wording proposed by the Parliamentary Delegation that was included in Section 8 concerning medical surveillance, and in the relevant preamble paragraph. We can say that the reconciliation procedure was rapid and successful beyond our expectations, and a final agreement was reached as early as December 2005.\nConsequently, this is what I would like to ask my colleagues and Parliament to support during the voting.", "lang": "HU", "original": "Csaba \u0150ry (PPE-DE), el\u0151ad\u00f3 . \u2013 Engedj\u00e9k meg, hogy r\u00f6viden \u00f6sszefoglaljam ennek a bonyolult jogalkot\u00e1si elj\u00e1r\u00e1snak a f\u0151bb \u00e1llom\u00e1sait, amelynek eredm\u00e9nyek\u00e9nt most harmadik olvasatban t\u00e1rgyalhatjuk az optikai sug\u00e1rz\u00e1sokr\u00f3l sz\u00f3l\u00f3 ir\u00e1nyelvet.\nA folyamat kiindul\u00e1si pontj\u00e1t a 89/391/EGK keretir\u00e1nyelv jelentette, amely \u00e1tfog\u00f3an szab\u00e1lyozta a munkahelyi biztons\u00e1g \u00e9s eg\u00e9szs\u00e9gv\u00e9delem eg\u00e9sz ter\u00fclet\u00e9t, \u00e9s a munkahelyen el\u0151fordul\u00f3 minden lehets\u00e9ges kock\u00e1zat tekintet\u00e9ben megteremtette egy egys\u00e9ges megk\u00f6zel\u00edt\u00e9s jogi kereteit.

Let me start by looking through the provided debate summary.\n\nFirst, the summary mentions that \u0150ry is the rapporteur and presented the compromise as a successful conclusion. The original proposal covered both natural and artificial radiation, but Parliament's second reading decided to delegate solar radiation to Member States, which \u0150ry says violated EU competences under Article 137 of the Treaty of Rome. The conciliation led to limiting the directive to artificial sources only, which \u0150ry supports as practical. He also quotes him saying that there are no disputed questions among lawmakers regarding artificial radiation, so it's time to implement the specific directive.\n\nSo, the key points here are: \n1. The compromise was a successful outcome of negotiations.\n2. The original proposal included both natural and artificial radiation, but the second reading shifted solar radiation responsibility to Member States, which \u0150ry argues was against EU competences.\n3. The conciliation result limits the directive to artificial sources, which he finds practical and necessary.\n4. He emphasizes that there's no controversy among lawmakers about artificial radiation, so the directive should be implemented promptly.\n\nI need to make sure I don't include other speakers' points. The user specified to only include arguments from the named speaker, which is \u0150ry here. The summary also mentions other speakers like Mann, Lynne, Hughes, etc., but those are not part of \u0150ry's contributions. \n\nSo the answer should list these four points. Let me check again to ensure I didn't miss anything else \u0150ry said. The quote provided is about artificial radiation having no disputed questions, so that's part of his argument. Also, the part about the conciliation process resulting in the limit to artificial sources. The part about the Treaty of Rome is important because he's citing the legal basis for why the original proposal was problematic. \n\nYes, that's all. I think that's comprehensive. No other points from \u0150ry are mentioned in the summary. The rest of the debate is about other speakers' opinions, which I should ignore as per the user's instructions.\n</think>\n\nCsaba \u0150ry (PPE-DE) argued that the compromise directive, limiting coverage to artificial optical radiation, was a practical and necessary outcome of negotiations. He stated that the original proposal's inclusion of natural radiation (sunlight) conflicted with EU competences under Article 137 of the Treaty of Rome, as Parliament's second reading had delegated solar radiation regulation to Member States. \u0150ry emphasized that there were no disputes among lawmakers regarding artificial radiation, asserting that \"a precise regulation is necessary\" for this area. He supported the conciliation result, which excluded natural radiation, as it allowed for immediate implementation of targeted rules for artificial sources.", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Vladim\u00edr \u0160pidla,", "english": "Vladim\u00edr \u0160pidla, Member of the Commission . \u2013 (CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to thank the Council and Parliament, on the Commission\u2019s behalf, for their endeavours in this area.

The adoption of this new Directive, the provisions of which are based on the latest scientific reports, will make it possible to guarantee greater safety and health protection for all workers exposed in the workplace to artificial optical radiation. The Commission is pleased that this directive complies entirely with the acquis communautaire in the area of protecting the health and safety of workers whilst ensuring the flexibility and proportionality required for businesses to be competitive. The directive on which we have agreed forms part of moves to improve legislation which, on the one hand, ensures that businesses are not disproportionately or unnecessarily overloaded and, on the other hand, complies with Article 137 of the Treaty, on protecting workers\u2019 health and safety.

Let me look through the summary provided.\n\nThe user mentioned that the debate was about a directive on worker exposure to optical radiation, and \u0160pidla is the Commission member. In the summary, under \"Commission Support,\" it says that Commissioner \u0160pidla welcomed the balanced approach. He emphasized that the directive is based on the latest scientific reports and would ensure greater safety while keeping flexibility for businesses. He also called it \"better regulation\" that avoids disproportionate burdens.\n\nSo, the key points here are: supporting the compromise, mentioning scientific basis, balancing safety and business flexibility, and referring to it as better regulation. The user wants only the points attributed to \u0160pidla, so I should exclude others. Let me check if there's anything else. The conclusion mentions \u0160pidla's statement about progress and expecting support, but the user's query is about the speaker's arguments, not the conclusion. So the main points are the ones listed in the \"Commission Support\" section. I need to present these clearly without including other speakers' contributions.\n</think>\n\nVladim\u00edr \u0160pidla supported the compromise directive, emphasizing that it is \"based on the latest scientific reports\" and will \"guarantee greater safety and health protection for all workers exposed to artificial optical radiation.\" He highlighted the need to \"ensure the flexibility and proportionality required for businesses to be competitive,\" framing the outcome as an example of \"better regulation\" that avoids imposing disproportionate burdens on businesses.

Yet we Christian Democrats were opposed to regulations on such natural optical rays as sunlight. Would building workers be allowed to work in the open air only with protective headgear and long shirts? Would the lifeguards in swimming pools be virtually wholly wrapped up? Would waitresses in beer gardens have to cover up their decollet\u00e9 ? Was all this really to be imposed uniformly right across Europe? We supported German building workers when they demonstrated in front of the Parliament building here in Strasbourg \u2013 an event that got a very strong helping hand from the European People Party\u2019s SME group \u2013 my group\u2019s tradesmen \u2013 and from the British members of our Group\u2019s European Democrat wing, including the energetic Mr Bushill-Matthews. By means of amendments, first in the lead committee \u2013 the Committee for Employment and Social Affairs \u2013 and then in the plenary, we got a majority in favour of doing away with the mandatory health checks and with expensive action programmes against sunburn, which would have laid still more administrative burdens on the backs of small and medium-sized enterprises. We voted for solutions founded upon the solidarity principle, with the Member States themselves deciding on what measures they regarded as reasonable, adapted to the most diverse weather conditions and, of course, also to different skin sensitivities, all of which vary from one country to another.\nI might add that, in the Conciliation Committee, of which I was a member, it did not take us long to reach a workable compromise with the Commission and the Council. We withdrew our demand for the application of the subsidiarity principle in return for the deletion of the references to natural optical radiation, which were not replaced by anything else. The title of the draft directive now refers to \u2018artificial optical radiation\u2019.\nI wish to thank, once again, our rapporteur, Mr \u00d6ry, for the work he has done. Together, we have highlighted the need for decisions at European level to be workable in everyday life. The European Union should spend less time on peripheral issues and a great deal more on the problems that really matter, such as the fight against unemployment and campaigns for sustainable protection for the environment and for effective cooperation in internal and external security.

He criticized what he sees as excessive EU intervention. \n\nSo, his main arguments are against regulating natural radiation (sunlight), arguing it would create impractical burdens. He uses the example of construction workers needing protective clothing, implying that such regulations are too strict and not feasible. He also mentions opposing excessive EU intervention, suggesting that the directive goes beyond necessary regulations.\n\nI need to make sure I don't include other speakers' points. The user wants only Thomas Mann's contributions. The summary also mentions Elizabeth Lynne and Anja Weisgerber, but those are separate. \n\nSo the key points from Mann are: \n1. Opposing regulation of natural radiation (sunlight) because it's impractical.\n2. Example of building workers needing protective gear, implying the regulations are too burdensome.\n3.

That would mean, for example, that a travel agency in my region could quickly discount the risk for employees working indoors in its shops in the north of England, but that it had better take very seriously the risk facing its staff acting as company representatives in Mediterranean resorts throughout the summer months.\nThat is the difficulty now facing employers.

I should like to begin by saying that I am, of course, in favour of this proposed legislation. I am disappointed, however, with the outcome of the conciliation process, and in particular the role played by Parliament. The negotiations on this Directive, which is sometimes referred to as the sunlight exposure directive, have instead been more reminiscent of a second-rate soap opera. Initially, the experts, the European institutions and the Member States agreed that it would be necessary to add further legislation to the general regulation on health and safety at work that would have simplified the legislation on protection from optical radiation and made it workable. Similar legislation was adopted in the previous period, in relation to noise, vibrations and electromagnetic radiation. What is more, nobody has referred to the very modest limit values for exposure to optical radiation, as set out in the annex to the proposed Directive.\nThe rapporteur, Mr \u0150ry, has shown tremendous determination and I should like to congratulate him for seeking a compromise. Nevertheless, it was his political group that had opposed the inclusion of all natural sources of optical radiation in this Directive. It strikes me as rather absurd that fierce opposition to clearly defined rules and standards for informing workers and protecting them against sunlight radiation has come principally from those Member States in which there is already a decent level of protection, whereas countries such as Italy, where much greater effort is required, did not raise any fundamental objections. Perhaps the Italians know, in short, that information on and prevention of illness at work is cheaper for workers than doing nothing.\nThe Directive on optical radiation would be a practical step, bringing not only improvements in the protection of the workers, but also a simplification of European legislation.

We are empowered to draft the sort of directives that will be of benefit to the public.\nVerheugen and others are always talking about the better lawmaking that will bring about more growth and jobs in the EU, but it is regulations like these that need to be improved first. It is a matter of considerable surprise that we have now been able, in the conciliation procedure, to persuade the Commission and Council of this.\nThe parts of this directive that make sense \u2013 the ones dealing with the protection of workers from artificial optical radiation, such as lasers, infra-red light and the like \u2013 remain unchanged. As regards the regulations on natural radiation, it has to be said that the Commission missed the mark by a long way, for the original proposal for a directive required employers to commission comprehensive assessments of the risks associated with sunlight and bureaucratic action plans to deal with them, which would have involved employers having to provide t-shirts and suncream for workers working outdoors. It would also have entailed liabilities of which employers would have been unaware, and, in any case, any sane person is the best judge of when and how they should protect themselves against the sun. It is all about personal responsibility and is pretty much the last thing that Europe should be laying down the law about.\nEurope has quite different problems to deal with, in the shape of unemployment, exhausted social security systems and more and more aged people among the population. Those are the things we need to worry about, not protection from sunlight. Even the Commission and the Council have come to their senses and recognised this in the course of the conciliation procedure, and I am very glad that they have. It has made possible a considerable improvement in the directive and prevented over-regulation that would have resulted in needless additional expense, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises.\nI urge you to vote, tomorrow, in favour of the Conciliation Committee\u2019s proposal, and then we will flag up our desire for less bureaucracy and less red tape throughout Europe.", "lang": "DE", "original": "Anja Weisgerber (PPE-DE). \u2013 Herr Pr\u00e4sident, liebe Kolleginnen und Kollegen!

The process that has brought this change of thinking has been a long and laborious one, beginning with sympathy for the workers, followed by the realisation that employers had a duty of care, and that suffering and illness can be alleviated through treatment.

The summary has a section titled \"Medical Perspective\" where Matsakis is mentioned. Let me check that part again.\n\nUnder the \"Medical Perspective\" section, it says: \"Marios Matsakis (ALDE) acknowledged the directive's importance for preventing 'serious eye trauma \u2013 including blindness \u2013 or severe skin damage, including cancer initiation' from artificial sources, but warned that 'the biggest source of optical radiation is not artificial radiation but the sun' and called for future action on solar exposure [Matsakis, 2006-02-13].\"\n\nSo, Matsakis's arguments here are two-fold. First, he acknowledges the importance of the directive in protecting workers from artificial optical radiation, mentioning specific risks like eye trauma, blindness, skin damage, and cancer. Second, he points out that the main source of optical radiation is the sun, not artificial sources, and therefore, there's a need for future action regarding solar exposure.\n\nI need to make sure there are no other mentions of Matsakis in other parts of the summary. Let me scan through the other sections quickly. The other sections mention other speakers like \u0150ry, \u0160pidla, Mann, Lynne, Weisgerber, Hughes, J\u00f6ns, Ma\u0161t\u00e1lka, Kusstatscher, Harkin. No other mentions of Matsakis. \n\nSo the main points are: \n\n1. The directive is important for preventing specific health issues from artificial radiation.\n2. The primary source of optical radiation is the sun, so future attention should be on solar exposure.\n\nI should present these as the arguments made by Matsakis. The user wants the answer to include only his points, not others. Also, the response should be in English, and if there are no points, return an empty string.

He emphasized that the directive is based on the latest scientific reports. His main points seem to be about the directive's basis in science, ensuring worker safety, and maintaining flexibility for businesses. He also mentioned \"better regulation\" and avoiding disproportionate burdens on businesses. \n\nI need to make sure I don't include anything from other speakers. The summary mentions other speakers like Mann, Lynne, \u0150ry, etc., but the user wants only \u0160pidla's points.

I should present these clearly, using the exact quotes if possible, but the user might want a summary rather than direct quotes. However, the example response uses the quotes, so maybe that's acceptable.
