{"speaker": "Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso,", "english": "Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, President of the Commission . Mr President, the publication of cartoons in Danish and other European newspapers and the reactions to this have revealed sensitive and fundamental issues. The cartoons have aggrieved many Muslims all over the world. We must respect these sensitivities and the expression of them through peaceful protest, which is a fundamental right in any open society.\nI share the views expressed by Prime Minister Rasmussen, where he made clear that his government respects Islam as one of the world\u2019s major religions and that it has no intention of insulting Muslims and does not support activities in this sense. Today, I should like personally to emphasise my deep respect for Islamic civilisation and the contribution it has made and continues to make to Europe.\nThe Commission\u2019s concern is not with the peaceful response of the majority to the cartoons. It is with the violent reactions of a minority; reactions which have been disowned by many Muslims. Therefore the Commission condemns, in the strongest possible terms, the violence perpetrated against our office in Gaza, and against the missions of the Member States, in particular those of Denmark. It is ironic that the aim of these missions is to bring real benefits to the lives of the people of their host countries.\nA trade boycott is not an appropriate way of addressing the issue, either: it would hurt the economic interests of all parties and could damage the growing trading links between the European Union and the countries concerned. Trade, and the greater interconnections it brings, is a means to promote mutual understanding. Let us be clear: a boycott of Danish goods is by definition a boycott of European goods.\n(Applause)\nI have spoken with the Prime Minister of Denmark and expressed the solidarity of the Commission. I want here today to send my solidarity to the people of Denmark as well; a people who rightly enjoy the reputation of being amongst the most open and tolerant not just in Europe, but in the world. I welcome here today their representatives in the form of a delegation from the Danish Parliament.\n(Applause)\nI have also spoken with the President-in-Office of the Council, Chancellor Sch\u00fcssel. The Commission will continue to work with the Austrian Presidency and all parties to resolve the problem peacefully and efficiently.\nThis issue raises wider themes. Our European society is based on respect for the individual person\u2019s life and freedom, equality of rights between men and women, freedom of speech, and a clear distinction between politics and religion. Our point of departure is that as human beings we are free, independent, equal and responsible. We must safeguard these principles.\nFreedom of speech is part of Europe\u2019s values and traditions. Let me be clear: freedom of speech is not negotiable. Like all freedoms, its preservation depends on responsible use by individuals.\n(Applause)\nWe all condemn all forms of prejudice and discrimination wherever and whenever they are expressed. But governments or other public authorities do not prescribe or authorise the opinions expressed by individuals. Conversely, the opinions expressed by individuals engage these individuals, and only them. They do not engage a country, a people, a religion and we should not allow others to pretend that they do.\n(Applause)\nFreedom of speech and freedom of the press is the basis not only of the possibility to publish an opinion or a cartoon, but also to criticise it. Freedom of speech cuts both ways.\nFreedom of speech has limits as well. These must be respected. They are defined and enforced by the law and legal systems of the Member States of the European Union. It is self-evidently unacceptable to go outside the law that is decided by democratic institutions.\nFreedom of religion is not negotiable either. Just as Europe respects freedom of speech, so it must \u2013 and does \u2013 respect freedom of religion. Religious freedom is a fundamental right of individuals and communities; it entails respect for the integrity of all religious convictions and all ways in which they are exercised. Muslims are and must be able to practise their faith in the same way as the adherents of other religions and convictions practise theirs.\nThe European Union and its Member States have for a long time promoted dialogue between different communities both within the European Union and with neighbouring Muslim countries, and in other parts of the world. It is through a vigorous but peaceful dialogue under the protection of freedom of expression that mutual understanding can be deepened and mutual respect can be built. I am fostering and will continue to foster dialogue between cultures and with religions. This dialogue must be based on tolerance, not prejudice, and on freedom of expression and religion and the values connected with them.\nViolence is the enemy of dialogue. We must not allow the minority of extremists to win. Let the best of our values win against the worst of prejudices.\n(Applause)", "lang": "EN", "original": "Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, President of the Commission .
