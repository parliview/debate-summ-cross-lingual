The user provided a parliamentary debate summary about the Right to Freedom of Expression and Respect for Religious Beliefs, specifically focusing on the Danish newspaper cartoons. The task is to outline the main points of the speaker named \"President.\" \n\nFirst, I need to figure out who the \"President\" refers to in this context. Looking at the debate summary, there are several speakers mentioned, including Hans Winkler (Council President), Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, etc. The term \"President\" might be referring to Hans Winkler, who is noted as the Council President. However, the user specified \"President\" as the speaker, so I need to check if there's a mention of a President in the debate summary.\n\nLooking through the summary, under the \"Positions on Freedom of Expression\" section, Hans Winkler is mentioned as the Council President. The user's query says the speaker is \"President,\" so it's likely referring to Hans Winkler. But I need to confirm if there's any other president mentioned. The summary also mentions Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso as the President of the European Commission, but the user might be referring to the Council President.\n\nNext, I need to extract the points made by this speaker. The user's example response includes issueSum, positionSum, argSum, propSum. So I need to go through the debate summary and find any contributions made by the President (Hans Winkler).\n\nIn the \"Positions on Freedom of Expression\" section, Hans Winkler's contribution is: \"Freedom of expression is an important asset, one we must defend and, indeed, for which we have fought long in our societies throughout European history.\" Also, under \"Government Role and Media Independence,\" Winkler says: \"the responsibility of the press is a personal one, and that governments should not tell it what it can or cannot do.\"\n\nAdditionally, in the \"Dialogue and Bridge-Building Proposals\" section, Winkler outlines comprehensive plans including involving Turkey as a bridge, hosting UN alliance of civilizations meetings, and making EU-Islamic world dialogue a priority.\n\nSo the key points for the President (Hans Winkler) would be:\n\n- Defending freedom of expression as a fundamental value.\n- Emphasizing that governments shouldn't control media content.\n- Proposing dialogue initiatives like involving Turkey, UN meetings, and EU-Islamic dialogue.\n\nNow, structuring this into the required JSON format. The issueSum would be the balance between freedom of expression and religious sensitivity. PositionSum would be his support for free expression and opposition to government control. ArgSum would be based on defending European values and democratic principles. PropSum would include his proposals for dialogue.\n\nWait, but the user's example has specific fields. Let me check again. The user's example has \"issueSum\" as a summary of key issues, \"positionSum\" as positions, \"argSum\" as arguments, and \"propSum\" as proposals.\n\nSo for Hans Winkler:\n\nissueSum: The balance between freedom of expression and religious sensitivity, government role in media, and promoting dialogue between civilizations.\n\npositionSum: Supports defending freedom of expression as a core value, opposes government control over media, and advocates for dialogue initiatives.\n\nargSum: Argues that freedom of expression is essential for European societies and that governments should not interfere with press responsibility.\n\npropSum: Proposes initiatives like involving Turkey, UN meetings, and EU-Islamic dialogue.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the response only includes what's attributed to the speaker. The user's example also has specific wording. Let me check the exact quotes again.\n\nHans Winkler's quotes:\n\n- \"Freedom of expression is an important asset, one we must defend and, indeed, for which we have fought long in our societies throughout European history.\"\n\n- \"the responsibility of the press is a personal one, and that governments should not tell it what it can or cannot do.\"\n\n- In dialogue proposals: \"Winkler outlined comprehensive plans including involving Turkey as a bridge, hosting UN alliance of civilizations meetings, and making EU-Islamic world dialogue a priority.\"\n\nSo the issueSum would be the core issues he addressed: freedom of expression, government role, and dialogue.\n\nPositionSum: He supports defending free expression, opposes government control, and supports dialogue.\n\nArgSum: His arguments are based on defending European values and the importance of press responsibility without government interference.\n\nPropSum: His proposals for dialogue initiatives.\n\nNow, structuring this into the JSON fields as per the example. Need to make sure that the summaries are concise and capture the essence without including other speakers' points.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The balance between freedom of expression and religious sensitivity, the role of government in regulating media, and the need for dialogue between European and Islamic civilizations.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"Defends freedom of expression as a core European value, opposes government control over media content, and advocates for dialogue initiatives to bridge cultural divides.\",\n\"argSum\": \"Argues that freedom of expression is essential to European societies and that governments must not interfere with press responsibility, while emphasizing the importance of dialogue to address tensions.\",\n\"propSum\": \"Proposes comprehensive dialogue initiatives, including involving Turkey as a bridge, hosting UN alliance of civilizations meetings, and prioritizing EU-Islamic world dialogue.\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Hans Winkler,", "english": "Hans Winkler, President-in-Office of the Council. \u2013 (DE) Mr\u00a0President, Mr\u00a0President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the controversy we have seen in recent weeks over the caricatures that appeared in a Danish newspaper undoubtedly represents a most regrettable development, in that it touches on something the EU Member States and the EU itself have been striving for over many years: mutual trust and constructive cooperation among the various religious communities in our countries.\nThe trust and goodwill seen in all the Member States and also expressed by the institutions of the European Union in recent years seem to have been badly shaken. We have seen violent demonstrations that have even claimed lives. EU representations and other Member State institutions in various countries have been attacked and damaged. Threats have been issued and boycotts imposed.\nThis is a deeply regrettable development, which must prompt us to ask ourselves what has gone wrong and what can be done to prevent such events in future. A number of principles of our co-existence are at stake and should be discussed in conjunction with this issue.\nFirstly, there is a consensus that any form of violence, any violent reaction by militant groups, is to be condemned, as the Council Presidency has explicitly done from the outset.\nWe also expect the governments responsible to be aware of their responsibilities, including under international law, and to take appropriate preventive measures.\nIt is now important to help calm and defuse any violence or violent confrontations. The Council Presidency has been exercising its own political responsibility since the very start of these events. As early as 30\u00a0January, the Council assured Denmark, Sweden and all the other countries concerned of its complete solidarity, whilst the Ministers for Foreign Affairs in the Council also emphasised the importance of freedom of the press and freedom of expression, which represent a cornerstone of the values championed by the European Union. Freedom of expression is an important asset, one we must defend and, indeed, for which we have fought long in our societies throughout European history. At the same time, however, the exercise of the right of free expression, as of any right, entails a great deal of responsibility, on the part of both individuals and institutions.\nEarly on, the EU, and also the United Nations and other organisations, a notable example being the Organization of the Islamic Conference, issued statements attempting to clarify the principles that must be adhered to in the course of this debate. The joint statement by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the Secretary General of the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy of 7\u00a0February was very important in this regard, putting particular emphasis on responsible conduct where people\u2019s religious convictions are concerned as well as on freedom of expression, which entails responsibility \u2013 a personal responsibility \u2013 on the part of the press. Our societies do not permit governments to dictate what the independent press may say or may not say, provided it is within the limits set by the legal systems; which is a good thing. These legal systems must conform to international standards, in particular to the principles of the European Convention on Human Rights.\nThe statement of 7\u00a0February I referred to also rejects and condemns violent attacks and calls for dialogue. On 8\u00a0February, Ursula Plassnik, Austrian Minister for Foreign Affairs and President of the General Affairs and External Relations Council, had a telephone conversation with Abdullah G\u00fcl, Turkish Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs. Our involvement of Turkey in the endeavours to calm the situation has been a conscious decision, as that country is particularly well placed to play a very active, constructive role in promoting dialogue between Europe and the Islamic world. Austria has also, therefore, invited the High Level Group on the alliance of civilisations \u2013 which is under the auspices of the United Nations \u2013 to hold its next meeting in Austria.\nAustrian Chancellor Sch\u00fcssel, President of the European Council, issued a statement, also on 8\u00a0February, expressing his consternation at images on the website of an Islamic emigrants\u2019 organisation in Antwerp and at the call by the Iranian newspaper Hamshahri for a Holocaust-cartoon contest. We must also take a clear position condemning and rejecting such initiatives and calls.\nAs you know, the High Representative for the CFSP, Javier Solana, is currently in the Middle East. On 13\u00a0February, he met with the Secretary General of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu, to discuss the possibility of a targeted dialogue between Europe and the Islamic world. The Secretary General and the High Representative will continue this discussion with the Secretary General of the League of Arab States and with representatives of Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, the Palestinian Authority and Israel.\nThe Council, and also individual Member States, will actively promote the dialogue with the Islamic world and continue along this path of dialogue between civilisations, and between religious communities. Finnish Minister for Foreign Affairs Tuomioja, too, has already announced that dialogue will be a key preoccupation of the Finnish Presidency.\nOur Presidency will also take further steps to help calm the situation. The possibility of enhanced dialogue between the EU and the Islamic world will be an important topic at the next General Affairs and External Relations Council on 27 and 28\u00a0February.\nThe present crisis calls for leadership on the part of the elected political representatives of the EU. Of course, this leadership cannot and should not consist in attempts by the state to impose a code of conduct on the media. I have already emphasised the importance to EU values of freedom of expression and freedom of the press, and on no account should this hard-won freedom from censorship be put at risk. As the European Court of Human Rights has made clear in very many fundamental rulings, this freedom also extends to permitting new, controversial ideas and any kind of discussion, and also entails the freedom to both make mistakes and sharply criticise the mistakes of others. As the European Court of Human Rights stated in a fundamental ruling 20\u00a0years ago, freedom of expression also extends to potentially offensive or irritating material. The Court has also stated, however, that this freedom of expression must of course be subject to limits; that is, where the feelings \u2013 particularly religious feelings \u2013 of others could be offended.\nThe EU\u2019s political leadership must now take the form of our conveying credibly that freedom of expression and respect for other cultures and religions do not contradict each other, but rather complement and are compatible with each other. We believe that the response to the present crisis should not be less freedom of expression, but rather credible commitment by a democratic, pluralist Europe to dialogue between cultures and civilisations. We must convey to the world\u2019s Muslim communities that we wish to continue to work alongside them in developing a relationship built on trust. We must communicate to our Muslim fellow citizens in the EU that this Union is a good place, where they and the adherents of other religions are respected and can feel at home, and where they have the opportunity of democratic participation. It is important that our response to this challenge be based, in particular, on the trust that has been successfully built up in all Member States in the past years, both among religious communities and between politicians and religious communities.\nI should like to draw the House\u2019s attention to a number of activities that have taken place in my own country, Austria, as this situation very much calls for Member States, too, to assume their responsibilities; and, of course, the Council is also dependent on the activities of the individual Member States in its role as spokesperson on its own behalf and that of the EU as a whole.\nOne of the most important conversations Austria\u2019s leading representatives have held in recent days in an attempt to defuse the situation is the one that took place on 7\u00a0February between Foreign Minister Plassnik and Anas Schakfeh, President of the Islamic Communities of Austria. This emphasised the importance of peaceful co-existence among the various religious communities in our countries and stated that the important thing now is to stand side by side and ensure that our ongoing discussions, which have proved valuable in practice, are also outwardly visible. This is a culture of dialogue that Austria, like all other Member States, has built up over the years, and which now has to prove itself in a crisis.\nIn recent months, Austria has seen some very important events, such as a major conference on the subject of \u2018Islam in a pluralist society\u2019, attended by large numbers of religious and political leaders: the President of Afghanistan, the President of Iraq, the former President of Iran, religious dignitaries from all religious communities. Two days ago, the Austrian Chancellor invited all the leaders of the large state-recognised religious communities in Austria to a meeting, at which all participants were unanimous in emphasising that peaceful coexistence, and peaceful \u2013 including critical \u2013 dialogue, is the only way to prevent developments of the kind seen in recent weeks. It is important to continue this dialogue, therefore; but also to defend our values, such as the right of free expression.\n(Applause)", "lang": "DE", "original": "Hans Winkler, amtierender Ratspr\u00e4sident . Herr Pr\u00e4sident, Herr Kommissionspr\u00e4sident, meine sehr verehrten Damen und Herren Abgeordneten! Die Kontroverse, die wir in den letzten Wochen um die Karikaturen erlebt haben, die in einer d\u00e4nischen Zeitung erschienen sind, stellen zweifellos eine sehr bedauerliche Entwicklung dar, weil sie an etwas r\u00fchrt, worum sich die Mitglieder der Europ\u00e4ischen Union und die Europ\u00e4ische Union selbst seit vielen Jahren bem\u00fcht hat, n\u00e4mlich um ein vertrauensvolles, konstruktives Miteinander der verschiedenen Religionsgemeinschaften in unseren L\u00e4ndern.\nDieses Vertrauen und dieser gute Wille, der in allen Mitgliedstaaten und auch von den Institutionen der Europ\u00e4ischen Union in den letzten Jahren zum Ausdruck gebracht wurde, scheinen nun ersch\u00fcttert. Wir haben gewaltt\u00e4tige Demonstrationen erlebt, die auch Tote gefordert haben. Vertretungen der Europ\u00e4ischen Union und andere Einrichtungen der Mitgliedstaaten in verschiedenen Staaten wurden angegriffen und besch\u00e4digt. Drohungen wurden ausgesprochen. Boykottma\u00dfnahmen wurden gesetzt.\nAll das ist eine Entwicklung, die wir zutiefst zu bedauern haben und die uns veranlassen muss, uns zu fragen: Was ist hier schief gelaufen? Was ist hier zu tun, um derartige Ereignisse in Zukunft zu verhindern? Verschiedene Grunds\u00e4tze unseres Zusammenlebens stehen auf dem Spiel und sind mit dieser Frage zu diskutieren.\nZum Ersten besteht der Konsens, dass wir jede Form von Gewalt, jede gewaltt\u00e4tige Reaktion militanter Gruppierungen verurteilen m\u00fcssen. Die Ratspr\u00e4sidentschaft hat dies auch in klarer Weise von Anfang an getan.\nWir erwarten auch von den verantwortlichen Regierungen, dass sie sich der Verantwortung und auch der Verantwortlichkeit auch in einem v\u00f6lkerrechtlichen Sinn bewusst sind und entsprechende Schutzma\u00dfnahmen ergreifen m\u00fcssen.\nNun gilt es \u2013 was die Frage der Gewalt und die gewaltsame Auseinandersetzung betrifft \u2013, beruhigende Schritte zu setzen und zu einer Entspannung der Lage beizutragen. Die Ratspr\u00e4sidentschaft hat von Anbeginn dieser Ereignisse ihre politische Verantwortung wahrgenommen. Schon am 30.\u00a0J\u00e4nner hat der Rat D\u00e4nemark und Schweden und allen anderen betroffenen L\u00e4ndern seiner vollen Solidarit\u00e4t versichert. Die Au\u00dfenminister im Rat haben aber gleichzeitig auch die Bedeutung von Presse- und Meinungsfreiheit unterstrichen, die einen Grundpfeiler unserer Werte, die wir in der Europ\u00e4ischen Union verteidigen, darstellen. Diese Meinungsfreiheit ist ein wichtiges Gut, das wir verteidigen m\u00fcssen und um das wir auch in unseren Gesellschaften in unserer europ\u00e4ischen Geschichte lange gek\u00e4mpft haben. Gleichzeitig aber bedeutet die Aus\u00fcbung dieses Rechts auf freie Meinungs\u00e4u\u00dferung wie die Aus\u00fcbung jedes Rechts ein hohes Ma\u00df an Verantwortung, an Verantwortung des Einzelnen, an Verantwortung der Institutionen.\nBereits fr\u00fchzeitig haben die Europ\u00e4ische Union, aber auch die Vereinten Nationen und andere Organisationen, wie zum Beispiel insbesondere auch die Organisation der Islamischen Konferenz in Erkl\u00e4rungen versucht, die Grunds\u00e4tze, an die wir uns in dieser Auseinandersetzung halten m\u00fcssen, zu verdeutlichen. Die gemeinsame Erkl\u00e4rung des Generalsekret\u00e4rs der Vereinten Nationen und des Generalsekret\u00e4rs der Organisation der Islamischen Konferenz sowie des Hohen Vertreters f\u00fcr die Gemeinsame Au\u00dfen- und Sicherheitspolitik vom 7.\u00a0Februar war in diesem Zusammenhang von gro\u00dfer Bedeutung. Darin werden gerade ein verantwortlicher Umgang mit religi\u00f6sen \u00dcberzeugungen sowie die Meinungsfreiheit bei gleichzeitiger Verantwortung der Presse betont. Diese Verantwortung der Presse ist eine Eigenverantwortung der Presse. Es ist in unseren Gesellschaften nicht m\u00f6glich \u2013 und das ist auch gut so \u2013, dass Regierungen unabh\u00e4ngigen Pressemedien vorschreiben, was sie sagen oder nicht sagen k\u00f6nnen, innerhalb der Grenzen, die von den Rechtsordnungen gesetzt werden. Diese Rechtsordnungen m\u00fcssen im Einklang mit den internationalen Normen, insbesondere mit der Europ\u00e4ischen Menschenrechtskonvention stehen.\nGewaltt\u00e4tige \u00dcbergriffe wurden auch in dieser Erkl\u00e4rung vom 7.\u00a0Februar, die ich erw\u00e4hnt habe, abgelehnt und verurteilt und es wurde zum Dialog aufgerufen. Am 8.\u00a0Februar telefonierte die Ratsvorsitzende Au\u00dfenministerin Plassnik mit dem t\u00fcrkischen Vizepremier und Au\u00dfenminister G\u00fcl. Es geschah sehr bewusst, dass wir die T\u00fcrkei in die Bem\u00fchungen um Beruhigung mit eingeschlossen haben, denn gerade die T\u00fcrkei kann eine sehr aktive und konstruktive Rolle bei der F\u00f6rderung des Dialogs zwischen Europa und der muslimischen Welt spielen. Wir haben daher auch \u2013 das ist eine \u00f6sterreichische Ma\u00dfnahme \u2013 die n\u00e4chste Sitzung der High Level Group der Allianz der Zivilisationen, die unter der Schirmherrschaft der Vereinten Nationen steht, zu ihrer n\u00e4chsten Sitzung nach \u00d6sterreich eingeladen.\nEbenfalls am 8.\u00a0Februar brachte der Vorsitzende des Europ\u00e4ischen Rates, Bundeskanzler Sch\u00fcssel, in einer Erkl\u00e4rung seine Best\u00fcrzung \u00fcber Darstellungen auf der Homepage einer muslimischen Emigrantenorganisation in Antwerpen und \u00fcber den Aufruf der iranischen Zeitung Hamschahri zu einem Holocaust-Karikaturenwettbewerb zum Ausdruck. Auch hier m\u00fcssen wir deutlich Position beziehen, dass derartige Initiativen und Aufrufe zu verurteilen und abzulehnen sind.\nWie Sie wissen, befindet sich der Hohe Vertreter f\u00fcr die Gemeinsame Au\u00dfen- und Sicherheitspolitik, Javier Solana, derzeit im Nahen Osten. In einem Treffen mit dem Generalsekret\u00e4r der Organisation der Islamischen Konferenz, Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu, am 13.\u00a0Februar wurden die M\u00f6glichkeiten eines zielorientierten Dialogs zwischen Europa und der muslimischen Welt er\u00f6rtert. Diese Diskussion wird der Generalsekret\u00e4r und Hohe Vertreter mit dem Generalsekret\u00e4r der Arabischen Liga und mit Vertretern der L\u00e4nder Saudi-Arabien, \u00c4gypten, Jordanien, der Pal\u00e4stinensischen Autorit\u00e4t und Israel fortsetzen.\nWir, der Rat, aber auch die einzelnen Mitgliedstaaten werden den Dialog mit der islamischen Welt vorantreiben und auf diesem Weg des Dialogs zwischen den Zivilisationen, zwischen den Religionsgemeinschaften fortfahren. Auch der finnische Au\u00dfenminister Tuomioja hat bereits angek\u00fcndigt, dass Dialogaktivit\u00e4ten ein zentrales Anliegen der finnischen Pr\u00e4sidentschaft sein werden.\nWir werden auch als Pr\u00e4sidentschaft weiterhin Schritte setzen, die zur Beruhigung der Lage beitragen sollen. Beim n\u00e4chsten Treffen der Au\u00dfenminister am 27. und 28.\u00a0Februar werden M\u00f6glichkeiten verst\u00e4rkter EU-Dialogaktivit\u00e4ten mit der islamischen Welt ein wichtiges Thema sein.\nIn der gegenw\u00e4rtigen Krise ist Leadership der gew\u00e4hlten politischen Vertreter und Vertreterinnen der Europ\u00e4ischen Union gefordert. Diese Leadership kann und soll selbstverst\u00e4ndlich nicht darin bestehen, den Medien von staatlicher Seite Verhaltensma\u00dfregeln vorgeben zu wollen. Ich habe schon die Bedeutung der Meinungs- und Pressefreiheit f\u00fcr unsere Werte, f\u00fcr die Werte in der Europ\u00e4ischen Union, hervorgehoben. Diese Freiheit von Zensur wollen wir unter keinen Umst\u00e4nden aufs Spiel setzen. Sie wurde zu lange und zu schwer erk\u00e4mpft. Diese Freiheit \u2013 das hat der Europ\u00e4ische Gerichtshof f\u00fcr Menschenrechte in sehr vielen grundlegenden Entscheidungen auch deutlich gemacht \u2013 schlie\u00dft auch die Zulassung von neuen, kontroversen Gedanken und jeglicher Diskussion ein. Sie schlie\u00dft auch die Freiheit ein, einerseits Fehler zu machen und andererseits Fehler mit aller Sch\u00e4rfe zu kritisieren. Wie es der Europ\u00e4ische Gerichtshof in einer grundlegenden Entscheidung vor zwanzig Jahren gesagt hat: Die Meinungsfreiheit schlie\u00dft auch ein, zu schockieren und zu irritieren. Der Gerichtshof hat aber auch gesagt, dass es selbstverst\u00e4ndlich Grenzen f\u00fcr diese freie Meinungs\u00e4u\u00dferung geben muss, und zwar dort, wo sie die Gef\u00fchle anderer, vor allem auch die religi\u00f6sen Gef\u00fchle anderer, verletzt.\nDie politische Leadership der Europ\u00e4ischen Union muss sich nun daran zeigen, dass wir glaubw\u00fcrdig vermitteln, dass sich Meinungsfreiheit und der Respekt vor der Kultur und Religion des anderen einander nicht widersprechen, sondern erg\u00e4nzen und miteinander vereinbar sind. Die Antwort auf die gegenw\u00e4rtige Krise hei\u00dft unserer Meinung nach nicht weniger Meinungsfreiheit, sondern vielmehr glaubw\u00fcrdiges Engagement des demokratisch pluralistischen Europas im Dialog der Kulturen und Zivilisationen. Wir m\u00fcssen den muslimischen Gemeinschaften in der Welt vermitteln, dass wir mit ihnen weiter den Weg der Entwicklung vertrauensvoller Beziehungen gehen wollen. Wir m\u00fcssen unseren muslimischen Mitb\u00fcrgerinnen und Mitb\u00fcrgern innerhalb der Europ\u00e4ischen Union vermitteln, dass diese Union ein guter Ort ist, an dem sie ebenso wie die Angeh\u00f6rigen anderer Religionen respektiert werden und sich wohl f\u00fchlen k\u00f6nnen und an dem sie die M\u00f6glichkeit demokratischer Mitgestaltung haben. Bei der Annahme dieser Herausforderung wird es uns wichtig sein, sich besonders auf das Vertrauen zu st\u00fctzen, das in den vergangenen Jahren in allen Mitgliedstaaten zwischen den Religionsgemeinschaften untereinander sowie zwischen den politischen Verantwortlichen und den Religionsgemeinschaften aufgebaut werden konnte.\nIch darf auf einige Aktivit\u00e4ten hinweisen, die in meinem eigenen Land, \u00d6sterreich, get\u00e4tigt wurden, denn auch die Verantwortung der Mitgliedstaaten ist hier sehr gefordert, und der Rat, der f\u00fcr sich und die Europ\u00e4ische Union insgesamt spricht, muss sich hier selbstverst\u00e4ndlich auch auf die Aktivit\u00e4ten und T\u00e4tigkeiten der einzelnen Mitgliedstaaten st\u00fctzen.\nWas \u00d6sterreich betrifft, so war eines der wichtigsten Gespr\u00e4che, die \u00f6sterreichische Spitzenvertreter gerade in den letzten Tagen auf der Suche nach einer Entspannung der Situation gef\u00fchrt haben, jenes am 7.\u00a0Februar zwischen der Au\u00dfenministerin Plassnik und dem Pr\u00e4sidenten der Islamischen Glaubensgemeinschaft in \u00d6sterreich, Anas Schakfeh. Dabei wurde die Bedeutung des friedlichen Miteinanderlebens der verschiedenen Religionsgemeinschaften in unseren L\u00e4ndern hervorgehoben, und es wurde erkl\u00e4rt, dass es jetzt darum geht, zusammenzustehen und unser laufendes Gespr\u00e4ch, das sich in der Praxis bew\u00e4hrt hat, auch nach au\u00dfen hin sichtbar zu machen. Dies ist eine Dialogkultur, die wir in \u00d6sterreich, aber auch in allen anderen Mitgliedstaaten \u00fcber die Jahre aufgebaut haben und die sich nunmehr in einer Krise zu bew\u00e4hren hat.\nEs gab in \u00d6sterreich gerade in den letzten Monaten sehr wichtige Veranstaltungen, so etwa eine gro\u00dfe Konferenz zum Thema \u201eIslam in einer pluralistischen Gesellschaft\u201c, an der sehr viele religi\u00f6se, politische F\u00fchrer \u2013 der Pr\u00e4sident von Afghanistan, der Pr\u00e4sident des Irak, der fr\u00fchere Pr\u00e4sident des Iran, hohe geistliche W\u00fcrdentr\u00e4ger aller Religionsgemeinschaften \u2013 teilgenommen haben. Vor zwei Tagen hat der Bundeskanzler s\u00e4mtliche F\u00fchrer der gro\u00dfen anerkannten Religionsgemeinschaften in \u00d6sterreich zu einem Treffen eingeladen. Bei dieser Gelegenheit wurde von allen \u00fcbereinstimmend betont, dass nur ein friedliches Zusammenleben, eine friedliche \u2013 auch kritische \u2013 Auseinandersetzung miteinander der richtige Weg ist, um Entwicklungen, wie wir sie in den letzten Wochen erleben mussten, zu verhindern. Es geht also darum, diesen Dialog fortzusetzen; es geht aber auch darum, unsere Werte, wie etwa das Recht auf freie Meinungs\u00e4u\u00dferung, zu verteidigen.\n(Beifall)", "agenda_item": "Right to freedom of expression and respect for religious beliefs (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060215-ITEM-002", "intervention_id": "3-009", "summary_english": "{\n  \"headline\": \"Council Presidency condemns violent reactions to Danish cartoons while defending press freedom and promoting dialogue between civilizations\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"The speaker addresses the controversial Danish newspaper caricatures that sparked violent demonstrations, attacks on EU representations, threats, boycotts, and deaths.

One thing is crystal clear to us, however, and this forms our guiding principle. We shall defend freedom of the press, and we shall protect the feelings of believers, irrespective of their religion, and also the symbols that are important to them. We shall defend human rights and the achievements of the Enlightenment, and we shall uphold the right to profess one\u2019s faith, to be different and to be respected. It is only possible to achieve all this at the same time if all parties first remain calm and level-headed. Therefore, our plea today goes out, in particular, to representatives of the media in Europe, in Iran, in other Islamic countries; it goes out to those who seek to inflate the caricature row to a matter of political principle. Meeting polemic with polemic, aggression with aggression, and insensitivity with insensitivity, is not the way to a good future. We want an order that defends freedom of expression as one of the supreme human rights, whilst also being aware of its limits, which are to be found in the freedom and dignity of others. This order must show respect for the beliefs and religious sensitivities of others, whilst at the same time enabling a peaceful, constructive dialogue on the things that divide us both superficially and deep down at the heart of our being, of our values, experiences and feelings.\nIt follows from this that violence as a means of agitating or inciting outrage at differing opinions can never be accepted. We condemn all the instigators of the violent reactions in various countries across the world, for this was no spontaneous reaction \u2013 it did not take place until several months after the event \u2013 but was organised in part by regimes that do not value freedom of expression, but rather repress their people. This, too, must be made quite clear.\n(Applause)\nWe oppose all forms of violence; not only against people, but also against objects \u2013 flags or buildings \u2013 and we condemn them in the strongest terms. It is important to now add to this a rather more specific approach, as merely pledging ourselves to dialogue between cultures is not sufficient. I should like to make two very specific proposals; imperfect ones, admittedly, but food for thought nevertheless. Firstly, because we need to start with the young people, we should set up a committee of experts to examine school books in Europe and in the Islamic world to see the kind of words and values that are being attributed to each other and disseminated by this means. This committee should be under the joint auspices of the EU and the Organization of the Islamic Conference and, to make it most effective, the UN Secretary-General should be involved in the choice of experts.\nWe, or rather the Islamic world, have become agitated over a number of caricatures in a European \u2013 Danish \u2013 newspaper and other newspapers; but this is only one instance of hundreds \u2013 not to say thousands \u2013 of caricatures, including those in the Islamic world making fun of our \u2013 Christian \u2013 values and our convictions. This has to stop: both here and in the countries of the Islamic world.\n(Applause)\nSecondly, I was among those Members who participated in the Euro-Mediterranean Conference in Barcelona. We should use the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly to bring together elected politicians and representatives of civil society from Europe and our partner countries for regular dialogue and targeted discussions within the framework of the Barcelona process. The Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly could thus be a pivotal forum for the dialogue between cultures.\nAllow me to make one personal remark. From 1999 to this year, 2006, I have visited 16\u00a0Arab and Islamic countries. I recall a conversation with a very committed, credible senior cleric in Saudi Arabia, which was, all in all, a wonderful conversation. He then asked me how Muslims were treated in Europe. I replied that we should often like to see better integration, but that Muslims could practise their faith freely. I then asked a question in return: is it true that, in Saudi Arabia, the law requires that any Muslim wishing to convert to Christianity be punished with death? I did not receive an answer.\nTolerance is important; but it is a two-way process. Tolerance, reconciliation and understanding must be based on the truth, and that is what we advocate. I emphatically welcome what the President of the Commission said: an attack on one Member State is an attack on us all. In this sense, we of course stand in solidarity with Denmark, and this debate should send out a signal of tolerance and understanding, albeit based on reciprocity and recognition of the truth. Only then will we be on the path towards a good future based on dialogue between cultures.\n(Applause from the right and the centre)", "lang": "DE", "original": "Hans-Gert Poettering, im Namen der PPE-DE-Fraktion . \u2013 Herr Pr\u00e4sident, Herr Kommissionspr\u00e4sident, Herr Ratspr\u00e4sident, liebe Kolleginnen und Kollegen!

Wir werden die Pressefreiheit verteidigen, und wir werden die Gef\u00fchle von Gl\u00e4ubigen und auch die Symbole, die ihnen wichtig sind, gleichg\u00fcltig welcher Religion, sch\u00fctzen. Wir werden Menschenrechte und die Errungenschaften der Aufkl\u00e4rung verteidigen, und wir werden das Recht auf Glauben, auf Unterschied und Anerkennung sch\u00fctzen. Wir k\u00f6nnen dies nur gleichzeitig tun, wenn als Erstes Selbstbeherrschung und Besonnenheit auf allen Seiten besteht. Darum bitten wir heute vor allem die Vertreter der Medien in Europa, im Iran, in anderen islamischen L\u00e4ndern. Wir bitten diejenigen darum, die den Streit um die Karikaturen zu einem politischen Grundsatzstreit hochstilisieren wollen. Wir werden nicht in eine gute Zukunft gehen, wenn wir Polemik mit Polemik, Aggression mit Aggression, Unsensibilit\u00e4t mit Unsensibilit\u00e4t beantworten. Wir wollen eine Ordnung, die die Meinungsfreiheit als eines der h\u00f6chsten Menschenrechte verteidigt und die zugleich sensibel f\u00fcr ihre Grenzen ist, die sich in der Freiheit und der W\u00fcrde des anderen befinden.

Dies war ja keine spontane Reaktion \u2013 im \u00dcbrigen ist diese Reaktion erst nach Monaten erfolgt \u2013, sondern sie war zum Teil von Regimes organisiert, die nicht auf die Meinungsfreiheit setzen, sondern die Menschen unterdr\u00fccken, auch dies m\u00fcssen wir in aller Deutlichkeit zum Ausdruck bringen!\n(Beifall)\nWir wenden uns gegen alle Formen der Gewalt. Nicht nur gegen die Gewalt gegen Menschen, sondern auch gegen Gewalt gegen\u00fcber Gegenst\u00e4nden, gegen\u00fcber Fahnen oder Geb\u00e4uden und wir verurteilen sie auf Sch\u00e4rfste. Es geht jetzt darum, dass wir auch etwas konkreter werden. Allein den Dialog der Kulturen zu beschw\u00f6ren, reicht nicht aus \u2013 wir m\u00fcssen konkreter werden. Ich m\u00f6chte \u2013 ich wei\u00df, dies alles ist unvollkommen, aber es ist eine Anregung zum Nachdenken \u2013 zwei sehr konkrete Vorschl\u00e4ge machen: Erstens sollten wir \u2013 weil wir bei den jungen Menschen anfangen m\u00fcssen \u2013 eine Kommission von Schulbuchexperten einsetzen und die Schulb\u00fccher in Europa und in der islamischen Welt darauf untersuchen, welche Worte und Werte dort \u00fcbereinander verbreitet werden. Eine solche Kommission sollte von der Europ\u00e4ischen Union und der Organisation der islamischen Konferenzen gemeinsam getragen werden, am wirkungsvollsten unter Beteiligung des UNO-Generalsekret\u00e4rs bei der Auswahl der Experten.\nWir bzw. die islamische Welt haben uns \u00fcber einige Karikaturen in einer europ\u00e4ischen \u2013 d\u00e4nischen \u2013 und in einigen anderen Zeitungen erregt. Dies ist nur eine Dokumentation von Hunderten \u2013 um nicht zu sagen von Tausenden \u2013 von Karikaturen, in denen auch unsere Werte, die christlichen Werte, und unsere \u00dcberzeugungen in der islamischen Welt karikierend dargestellt werden. Damit muss Schluss sein \u2013 bei uns, aber auch in den L\u00e4ndern der islamischen Welt!\n(Beifall)\nZweitens: Wir waren mit anderen Kollegen in Barcelona bei der Euromediterranen Konferenz. Wir sollten die Euromediterrane Parlamentarische Versammlung nutzen, um Vertreter der gew\u00e4hlten Politik und Vertreter der Zivilgesellschaften aus Europa und aus unseren Partnerl\u00e4ndern im Rahmen des Barcelona-Prozesses zu regelm\u00e4\u00dfigen Gespr\u00e4chen und zielorientierten Beratungen zusammenzuf\u00fchren. So k\u00f6nnte die Euromediterrane Versammlung ein entscheidender Ort der Begegnung f\u00fcr den Dialog der Kulturen sein.\nGestatten Sie mir eine pers\u00f6nliche Bemerkung: Ich habe seit\u00a01999 bis in dieses Jahr\u00a02006 16\u00a0arabische und islamische L\u00e4nder besucht. Ich erinnere mich an ein Gespr\u00e4ch mit einem sehr engagierten, glaubw\u00fcrdigen hohen Vertreter der Geistlichkeit in Saudi-Arabien. Es war alles in allem ein wunderbares Gespr\u00e4ch. Diese Pers\u00f6nlichkeit hat mich dann gefragt, wie werden Moslems in Europa behandelt. Ich habe geantwortet, wir w\u00fcrden uns oftmals eine bessere Integration der Menschen w\u00fcnschen, aber sie k\u00f6nnten ihren Glauben leben. Ich habe dann die Gegenfrage gestellt: Ist es wahr, dass nach dem Gesetz in Saudi-Arabien eine Moslemin, ein Moslem, wenn er oder sie Christin oder Christ werden m\u00f6chte, nach dem Gesetz mit dem Tode bestraft wird? Eine Antwort darauf habe ich nicht bekommen.\nToleranz ist wichtig. Aber sie geht nicht nur in eine Richtung, sondern sie geht in beide Richtungen. Toleranz, Vers\u00f6hnung, Verst\u00e4ndigung muss sich auf die Wahrheit gr\u00fcnden, und daf\u00fcr treten wir ein. Ich begr\u00fc\u00dfe nachdr\u00fccklich, was der Pr\u00e4sident der Kommission gesagt hat. Wer ein Land der Europ\u00e4ischen Union angreift, der greift uns alle an. In einem solchen Sinne sind wir selbstverst\u00e4ndlich mit D\u00e4nemark solidarisch, und wir sollten von dieser Debatte ein Signal der Toleranz, der Verst\u00e4ndigung, allerdings auf der Grundlage der Gegenseitigkeit und der Akzeptierung der Wahrheit senden. Nur dann werden wir in eine gute Zukunft des Dialogs der Kulturen gehen k\u00f6nnen.\n(Beifall von rechts und aus des Mitte)", "agenda_item": "Right to freedom of expression and respect for religious beliefs (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060215-ITEM-002", "intervention_id": "3-011", "summary_english": "```json\n{\n  \"headline\": \"EPP-DE Group Calls for Balanced Approach to Cartoon Controversy, Defending Press Freedom While Respecting Religious Beliefs\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"The speaker addresses the controversy over caricatures (likely the Danish cartoon controversy) that sparked violent reactions in Islamic countries.

The user provided a debate summary about the Right to Freedom of Expression and Respect for Religious Beliefs, specifically regarding the Danish newspaper cartoons. The task is to outline the main points made by Hans-Gert Poettering, but only the points attributed to him.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the debate summary and find any mentions of Hans-Gert Poettering. The user mentioned that contributions from other speakers shouldn't be included, so I have to be careful not to add anything from others.\n\nLooking at the \"Executive Summary\" section, under \"Responses to Violence and Extremism,\" there's a mention of Hans-Gert Poettering. The summary says: \"Hans-Gert Poettering emphasized that 'We oppose all forms of violence; not only against people, but also against objects \u2013 flags or buildings \u2013 and we condemn them in the strongest terms.'\" \n\nSo, the key point here is his condemnation of violence against both people and objects. The issue here is about responding to violence and extremism. His position is opposing all forms of violence. The argument is likely that violence is unacceptable regardless of the target. The proposal or action would be condemning such violence strongly.\n\nI need to make sure there's no other information about him in other parts. Scanning through the rest of the summary, there's a mention under \"Government Role and Media Independence\" where Karin Riis-J\u00f8rgensen and others are discussed, but not Poettering. In the \"Dialogue and Bridge-Building Proposals,\" Winkler and others are mentioned. So, the only direct contribution from Poettering is the part about condemning violence.\n\nTherefore, the JSON should reflect that. The issue is about violence and extremism. His position is opposing all forms of violence. The argument is that violence is the enemy of dialogue, as he says \"Violence is the enemy of dialogue. We must not allow the minority of extremists to win.\" Wait, no, that quote is from Barroso. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, in the \"Responses to Violence and Extremism\" section, the summary says: \"Hans-Gert Poettering emphasized that 'We oppose all forms of violence; not only against people, but also against objects \u2013 flags or buildings \u2013 and we condemn them in the strongest terms.'\" So his position is opposing violence against people and objects. The argument here is that such violence is unacceptable. The proposal is not mentioned here, but the summary doesn't list any proposals from him. The \"propSum\" would be empty unless there's a proposal. The user said if there are no points, return an empty string.\n\nSo, the issueSum would be about violence and extremism. PositionSum is opposing all forms of violence. ArgSum would be the reasoning, but the summary doesn't elaborate on arguments beyond his statement. So maybe the argSum is that he believes violence must be condemned. But the exact argument isn't given, just his position. So perhaps the argSum is the same as the position. But the example given in the user's instruction has the argSum as the justification. Since the summary doesn't provide more details, maybe the argSum is just restating the position. However, the user's example has \"His support for strict limitations... is based on a need to prevent improper use.\" So in this case, the argument might be that violence is the enemy of dialogue, but that's from Barroso. Wait, no, the user's example is different. \n\nIn this case, the summary only states that Poettering condemned violence. The argument isn't explicitly stated, so perhaps the argSum is empty. But the user's example includes the argument. However, the user's instruction says to include only the points attributed to the speaker. Since the summary only states his position, maybe the argSum is not present. But the user's example has \"argSum\": \"His support for strict limitations on government demands for private data is based on a need to prevent improper use.\" So if the summary doesn't provide the reasoning, perhaps the argSum is empty. But in the given debate summary, the only thing mentioned about Poettering is his statement on opposing violence. So the argSum would be the reasoning behind his position, but the summary doesn't elaborate. Therefore, perhaps the argSum is empty. However, the user's example includes an argument even if it's inferred. But in this case, the summary doesn't give an argument, just the position. So maybe the argSum is empty. \n\nSimilarly, propSum would be any proposals. The summary doesn't mention any proposals from Poettering, only his condemnation. So propSum is empty. \n\nTherefore, the JSON would have issueSum as \"The key issue raised by the speaker relates to the condemnation of violence against people and objects.\", positionSum as \"He opposes all forms of violence, including against objects such as flags or buildings.\", argSum as \"\" (empty), and propSum as \"\" (empty). But the user's example includes argSum even if it's a brief statement. However, in the given case, the summary doesn't provide an argument, only the position. Therefore, the correct approach is to only include the points that are explicitly attributed. So, the issue is about violence, the position is opposing it, and no arguments or proposals are mentioned. Hence, the JSON would have issueSum and positionSum filled, and the others as empty strings.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The key issue raised by the speaker relates to the condemnation of violence against people and objects.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"He opposes all forms of violence, including against objects such as flags or buildings.\",\n\"argSum\": \"\",\n\"propSum\": \"\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Poul Nyrup Rasmussen,", "english": "Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, on behalf of the PSE Group. \u2013 (DA) Mr\u00a0President; Mr\u00a0President-in-Office of the Council; Mr\u00a0Barroso, President of the Commission; Mr\u00a0Schulz, our group chairman, has asked me to talk today on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, and that is something that I am pleased to do where this matter is concerned. It has been terrible and shocking to see people killed, my own country\u2019s and other countries\u2019 flags burned, ambassadors attacked and boycotts implemented, causing large numbers of innocent people to lose their jobs. It has been doubly depressing, given that our countries\u2019 history has also been about tolerance of other peoples and about understanding and respect for them. We have led the way in international solidarity and in economic and political aid to poor peoples around the world. We have always fought for justice and for peoples\u2019 right to their own independent states characterised by peaceful co-existence, especially in Palestine.\nIt is absolutely crucial that the violence we see should not get completely out of hand. That violence must stop now, and I should like, personally and on behalf of my country, to thank Mr\u00a0Barroso for the clear signal he has sent out today in Parliament and for the solidarity he has shown with my country and with all those countries that have been attacked. An attack on one Member State is an attack on the European Union as a whole.\nIt is also important to emphasise, however, that the European Union stands for the opposite of xenophobia and intolerance. European values are based on respect for peoples and religions. The whole of our bloody history has taught us the wisdom of mutual understanding, dignity and co-existence. The first thing I should therefore like to say today to the whole of the Muslim world and to everyone in Europe is that freedom of expression is not something on which we are able to compromise. No government or ordinary citizen can put a question mark over that freedom. Freedom of expression does not, however, exist in a vacuum. It must and will be exercised with responsibility. Nor can we compromise on respect for other peoples and religions. This is also fundamental to the human rights on which Europe and the UN are based. Freedom of expression must therefore go hand in hand with respect for other peoples. That is the way things have to be.\nI should like to use my freedom of expression today to criticise and clearly repudiate the cartoons of the prophet Muhammad that appeared in a Danish newspaper a few months ago. Publishing them was arrogant and disrespectful and reflected a total lack of knowledge of Islam. I should like to emphasise that the cartoons do not reflect the attitudes of ordinary Danes. We are well aware, both in Denmark and elsewhere in Europe, that the love of our own country, dignity and religion does not require us to criticise others or talk down to them when what is in question is something they regard as holy. I also know that many people in Europe cannot understand why the Danish Prime Minister refused to meet ambassadors from the Arab world. That is something that I too fail to understand. We cannot, however, change what has happened. Most important of all is the fact that the Danish Government subsequently used its freedom of expression clearly to express respect for other peoples and their religions, not least Islam. We must now look forward.\nWe want to send a clear signal today: we are determined to ignore new provocations, which cannot be used by extremists in Europe and in the Muslim world to inflame violence and intolerance and create new myths about each other.\nWe have seen it so many times before from xenophobic and populist parties in Europe and from the extremist movements in the Muslim world. We say \u2018no\u2019 to those who claim it is \u2018them against us\u2019. For much too long, extremists on both sides have been allowed to play their false tune. Worst of all, they have inflamed hatred and fear and they have gained an audience for their views. It is time for moderate and responsible voices to set a new agenda, as Mr Barroso said, a new agenda which clearly and unambiguously shows that there is another way.\nWe in Europe do not want to add fuel to the extremists\u2019 fire. Here, in the European Parliament, we have a clear message: we want to unite all forces in a new and far stronger dialogue with the Islamic world, building on unconditional respect \u2013 a respect extending beyond borders and applying to all people and religions. We know that we live in a globalised world. That gives us a special responsibility. In this globalised world it is not \u2018them against us\u2019: we are one. And no, it is not a clash between religions or civilisations.\nWhat we have witnessed are ignorant acts creating humiliation and insult. This was used by extremists to inflame hatred and violence. However, trying to understand the broader reactions, those cartoons, together with manipulation from extremists, were the last straw. Let us not forget the many years of social and economic frustrations in many Muslim societies. Let us now realise what humiliation and arrogance from those with power and wealth can result in.\nLet us not fall prey to short-sighted sanctions but, instead, stand by our economic and political cooperation. Let us put behind us what the cartoons initiated. Let it be the last thing to cause provocation, and let the next step unite us to build a stronger dialogue \u2013 critical, open, permanent and constructive.\n(Applause)", "lang": "DA", "original": "Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, for PSE-Gruppen . - Hr. formand, Hr. r\u00e5dsformand! Hr. Barroso, formand for Kommissionen! Martin Schulz, vores gruppeformand, har bedt mig om i dag at tale p\u00e5 Den Socialistiske Gruppes vegne, og det g\u00f8r jeg gerne i denne sag. Det har v\u00e6ret forf\u00e6rdeligt og opr\u00f8rende at se mennesker blive sl\u00e5et ihjel, mit og andre landes flag blive br\u00e6ndt, ambassader angrebet og boykot iv\u00e6rksat, s\u00e5 masser af uskyldige mennesker har mistet deres job. Det har v\u00e6ret dobbelt trist, fordi vore landes historie ogs\u00e5 handler om tolerance og forst\u00e5else og respekt for andre folk. Vi har v\u00e6ret forrest i international solidaritet og i \u00f8konomisk og politisk bistand til fattige folk rundt om i verden. Vi har altid k\u00e6mpet for retf\u00e6rdighed og folkenes ret til deres egen selvst\u00e6ndige stat i fredelig sameksistens, ikke mindst i Pal\u00e6stina.\nDet er fuldst\u00e6ndig afg\u00f8rende, at de voldsomheder, vi ser, ikke l\u00f8ber l\u00f8bsk. Den vold m\u00e5 standse nu. Og jeg vil gerne personligt og p\u00e5 mit lands vegne takke hr. Barroso for det klare signal her i dag i Parlamentet og for solidariteten med mit land og med alle de lande, der er blevet angrebet. Et angreb p\u00e5 et medlemsland er et angreb p\u00e5 hele EU.\nMen det er ogs\u00e5 vigtigt at understrege, at EU st\u00e5r for det modsatte af fremmedhad og intolerance. Europas v\u00e6rdier bygger p\u00e5 respekt for folkeslag og for religioner. Hele vores blodige historie har l\u00e6rt os den gensidige forst\u00e5elses, v\u00e6rdighedens og sameksistensens visdom. Derfor er det f\u00f8rste, jeg i dag gerne vil sige til hele den muslimske verden og til alle i Europa: Ytringsfriheden kan vi ikke g\u00e5 p\u00e5 kompromis med - ingen regering eller menig borger kan s\u00e6tte sp\u00f8rgsm\u00e5lstegn ved den frihed. Men ytringsfriheden befinder sig ikke i et tomrum - den m\u00e5 og skal forvaltes under ansvar. Vi kan heller ikke g\u00e5 p\u00e5 kompromis med respekten for andre folkeslag og for andre religioner. Det er ogs\u00e5 en fundamental del af de menneskerettigheder, som Europa og FN bygger p\u00e5. Derfor skal ytringsfriheden g\u00e5 h\u00e5nd i h\u00e5nd med respekten for andre folkeslag. S\u00e5dan m\u00e5 det v\u00e6re!\nJeg vil gerne benytte min ytringsfrihed i dag til at kritisere og tage klar afstand fra de tegninger af profeten Muhammed, der blev bragt i en dansk avis for nogle m\u00e5neder siden. Det var arrogant, det var respektl\u00f8st, og det var udtryk for en total mangel p\u00e5 viden om islam. Og jeg vil gerne understrege, at tegningerne ikke er udtryk for den almindelige danske befolknings holdninger. Vi ved godt i Danmark og rundt om i Europa, at vi ikke beh\u00f8ver at kritisere andre eller tale ned til andre, n\u00e5r det drejer sig om noget, de betragter som helligt, for at elske vores eget land, vores egen v\u00e6rdighed, vores egen religion. Jeg ved ogs\u00e5, at mange i Europa ikke kan forst\u00e5, at den danske statsminister n\u00e6gtede at m\u00f8des med ambassad\u00f8rer fra den arabiske verden. Det kan jeg heller ikke forst\u00e5. Men hvad der er sket, kan vi ikke \u00e6ndre. Og allervigtigst er det, at den danske regering efterf\u00f8lgende klart har brugt sin ytringsfrihed til at udtrykke respekt for andre folkeslag og deres religioner, ikke mindst islam. Nu m\u00e5 vi se fremad!\n(EN) Vi \u00f8nsker at sende et klart signal i dag. At afvise nye provokationer, som kan bruges af ekstremister i Europa og i den muslimske verden til at anspore til vold og intolerance og til at skabe nye myter om hinanden.\nVi har oplevet det mange gange f\u00f8r hos fremmedfjendske og populistiske partier i Europa og hos de ekstremistiske kr\u00e6fter i den muslimske verden. Men vi siger nej til dem, som mener at det er \"dem imod os\". Alt for l\u00e6nge har yderfl\u00f8jene p\u00e5 begge sider i Europa haft mulighed for at udbrede det forkerte budskab. Og det v\u00e6rste er, at de har skabt had og frygt og samlet en skare af tilh\u00e6ngere af deres synspunkter. Det er p\u00e5 tide, at der fastl\u00e6gges en ny, moderat og ansvarlig dagsorden, som hr. Barroso udtalte, en ny dagsorden som klart og tydeligt viser, at der er en anden m\u00e5de at g\u00f8re tingene p\u00e5.\nI Europa \u00f8nsker vi ikke at b\u00e6re ved til ekstremisternes b\u00e5l. I Europa-Parlamentet \u00f8nsker vi at sende et klart signal. Vi \u00f8nsker at forene alle kr\u00e6fter i en ny og langt st\u00e6rkere dialog med den islamiske verden, hvor vi bygger p\u00e5 uforbeholden respekt - en respekt, der er gr\u00e6nseoverskridende og g\u00e6lder alle mennesker og religioner. Vi ved, at vi lever i en globaliseret verden. Det giver os et s\u00e6rligt ansvar. I den globaliserede verden er det ikke \"dem imod os\", det er kun \"os\". Og nej, det er ikke et sammenst\u00f8d mellem religioner eller civilisationer.\nVi har v\u00e6ret vidne til t\u00e5belige handlinger, der var skabt ydmygelse og h\u00e5n. Denne handling blev udnyttet af ekstremister til at anspore til had og vold. Men hvis man skal pr\u00f8ve at forst\u00e5 det bredere reaktionsm\u00f8nster, var disse tegninger dr\u00e5ben, der fik b\u00e6geret til at flyde over. Vi skal ikke glemme de mange \u00e5rs sociale og \u00f8konomiske frustrationer i mange muslimske lande. Vi skal indse, hvad ydmygelse og arrogance fra dem, der har magt og overskud, kan f\u00f8re til.\nLad os ikke falde for fristelsen til at indf\u00f8re kortsigtede sanktioner, men st\u00e5 ved vores \u00f8konomiske og politiske samarbejde. Vi skal l\u00e6gge alle de begivenheder, som tegningerne satte i gang, bag os. Det skal v\u00e6re slut med provokationer, og det n\u00e6ste skridt skal v\u00e6re de f\u00e6lles bestr\u00e6belser p\u00e5 at opbygge en bedre dialog - kritisk, \u00e5ben, vedvarende og konstruktiv.\n(Bifald)", "agenda_item": "Right to freedom of expression and respect for religious beliefs (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060215-ITEM-002", "intervention_id": "3-012", "summary_english": "{\n\"headline\": \"Socialist MEP condemns Danish cartoons as provocative while defending freedom of expression and calling for respectful dialogue with Muslim world\",\n\"issueSum\": \"The speaker addresses the controversy surrounding Danish newspaper cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad, which led to violence, flag burning, embassy attacks, and boycotts.

Let me start by looking at the provided debate summary.\n\nThe user mentioned that the debate was about the balance between freedom of expression and respect for religious beliefs, especially concerning the Danish cartoons. The speaker in question is Poul Nyrup Rasmussen. \n\nLooking at the \"Executive Summary\" section, under \"Positions on Freedom of Expression,\" there's a mention of Poul Nyrup Rasmussen. The summary says he argued that \"Freedom of expression does not, however, exist in a vacuum. It must and will be exercised with responsibility,\" while criticizing the Danish cartoons as \"arrogant and disrespectful.\"\n\nSo, the key points here are that he emphasizes responsibility alongside freedom of expression. He criticizes the cartoons as being arrogant and disrespectful. The issue here is the balance between free speech and responsibility, especially when it comes to religious sensitivities. His position is that freedom of expression comes with the responsibility to be considerate. The argument is that without responsibility, free speech can be harmful. As for proposals, the summary doesn't mention any specific proposals from him, just his criticism and the emphasis on responsibility.\n\nI need to make sure I don't include other speakers' points. The user specified that only the speaker's own arguments should be included. So, the issue sum should reflect the balance between free expression and responsibility. The position sum is his stance on requiring responsibility. The argument is that freedom isn't absolute and must be exercised responsibly. There's no mention of specific proposals from him, so propSum would be empty.\n\nWait, the example response has propSum even if there's nothing. But the user said if there are no points, respond with an empty string. So I need to check if Rasmussen made any proposals. The summary says he criticized the cartoons but doesn't mention any proposals. So propSum would be an empty string.\n\nSo structuring the JSON accordingly. The issue is the balance between free expression and responsibility. Position is supporting responsibility. Argument is that freedom isn't in a vacuum. Proposals: none mentioned.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The balance between freedom of expression and the responsibility to avoid disrespectful or arrogant content, particularly in relation to religious beliefs.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"Argued that freedom of expression must be exercised with responsibility and criticized the Danish cartoons as 'arrogant and disrespectful'.\",\n\"argSum\": \"Stressed that freedom of expression is not absolute and must be tempered with responsibility to avoid causing unnecessary offense.\",\n\"propSum\": \"\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Karin Riis-J\u00f8rgensen,", "english": "Karin Riis-J\u00f8rgensen, on behalf of the ALDE Group . \u2013 Mr President, today the core message from Liberals and Democrats is to safeguard and defend freedom of speech, not only in Europe but also in Kabul and Tehran.

I believe that there is one thing that we, as politically minded people and politicians, must not do, and that is to attempt to define boundaries for the press, for example. That is something that politicians cannot and must not do; only society knows what is common sense. We politicians can of course discuss those actions of ours that are causing offence \u2013 for example where, as in Denmark, legislation on foreign nationals has been passed that offends and fails to respect immigrants. That can be criticised here, as the Council of Europe did in Denmark\u2019s case. We can also express criticism where, for example, a questionnaire for Muslims has been drawn up by German L\u00e4nder that shows Muslims a quite blatant lack of respect. Politicians can by all means criticise and discuss such things.\nLadies and gentlemen, this whole discussion on limits is a matter for society. Commissioner\u00a0Barroso is right: people are entitled to publish caricatures poking fun at us politicians, at me, at Mr\u00a0Poettering or anyone else. In society, we are entitled to express disapproval. Muslims are entitled to hold demonstrations in protest \u2013 we respect that \u2013 in the same way as members of the Jewish community demonstrated against a play by Rainer Werner Fassbinder. This is a debate that should be held within society. We cannot draw up a code of conduct for the press; either the press does that itself or it does not \u2013 it is not our job.\nIn the international debate, it is always pointed out that religions are to be respected. That may be so, but religions are in the public domain, and as such will be the subject of blasphemous caricatures. That is as integral to religion and democracy as air is to breathing; it is just the way things are. It does not mean that one has to approve of these caricatures or consider them to be in good taste. Freedom is not a matter of good or poor taste. Freedom is something we have fought for, and no civilisation has yet fallen on account of too much freedom, but always on account of too little; much too little.\nI can tell you, therefore, that I do not sympathise with the caricatures. I can tell you which ones made me smile, which ones made me laugh, which ones I found repellent. I do sympathise with all those who have fallen victim to violence in this dispute. I think it dreadful what, for example, large European enterprises such as Carrefour and Nestl\u00e9 have done, running advertisements in Saudi Arabia with the slogan \u2018We are not Danish, we are French\u2019. That is in bad taste, that is a legitimate target for our criticism. I ask that we all refrain from self-righteousness.\nLet us not exempt religion from the social debate, as religions, too, have the right to say what is right or wrong. We are not supposed to caricature them when they talk nonsense on the issues of abortion or homosexuality; yet we have the freedom to do so, and this is a freedom that we wish to defend.\nIf we were to show immigrants more respect in this world, if our laws were to show them more respect, they would have the opportunity to discuss our freedoms differently. Give them the freedoms that we claim for ourselves, and they will use them responsibly.\n(Applause from the Verts/ALE Group)", "lang": "DE", "original": "Daniel Marc Cohn-Bendit, im Namen der Verts/ALE-Fraktion . \u2013 Herr Pr\u00e4sident, liebe Kollegen!

The user provided a detailed parliamentary debate summary about the Right to Freedom of Expression and Respect for Religious Beliefs, specifically focusing on the Danish newspaper cartoons. The task is to extract the main points made by Daniel Marc Cohn-Bendit, but only his contributions, excluding others.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the debate summary and find any mentions of Daniel Marc Cohn-Bendit. Scanning through the sections, under the \"Positions on Freedom of Expression\" section, there's a mention: \"Daniel Marc Cohn-Bendit took the most absolutist position, arguing that 'no civilisation has yet fallen on account of too much freedom, but always on account of too little.'\"\n\nSo, his main argument is that freedom of expression is crucial and that excessive restrictions are harmful. The key points here are his absolutist stance on freedom of expression, emphasizing that too little freedom is the real problem, not too much. There's no mention of him discussing other issues like government role, dialogue proposals, or violence. His contribution is solely about the importance of free expression without restrictions.\n\nNow, structuring the JSON response. The issueSum should capture the core issue he addressed, which is the balance between freedom of expression and religious sensitivity. However, since he took an absolutist position, maybe the issue is more about advocating for maximum freedom. The positionSum would state his support for absolute freedom of expression. The argument is that civilizations fall due to lack of freedom, not excess. There's no proposal mentioned from him, so propSum would be empty.\n\nWait, the user's example has propSum as a summary of proposals. Since Cohn-Bendit didn't mention any specific proposals, just his argument, propSum should be an empty string. Similarly, issueSum should be about the issue he focused on, which is the importance of freedom of expression. But the original debate's core issue is the balance between freedom and religious beliefs. However, his contribution is specifically about freedom being essential, so the issueSum might be \"the importance of absolute freedom of expression in democratic societies.\"\n\nPositionSum: \"He took an absolutist position, arguing that freedom of expression is essential and that civilizations fall due to lack of it, not excess.\" \n\nArgSum: \"His argument is based on the belief that excessive freedom is not a threat, but insufficient freedom leads to civilizational decline.\"\n\nPropSum: \"\" (empty since he didn't propose any specific actions)\n\nI need to make sure not to include any other speakers' points. The user's example has empty strings when there's no info. So, if there's no proposals, propSum is empty. Similarly, if there's no other positions, but in this case, he did have a position. So the JSON should reflect that.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The importance of absolute freedom of expression in democratic societies and the potential dangers of excessive restrictions.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"He took an absolutist position, arguing that freedom of expression is essential and that civilizations fall due to lack of it, not excess.\",\n\"argSum\": \"His argument is based on the belief that excessive freedom is not a threat, but insufficient freedom leads to civilizational decline.\",\n\"propSum\": \"\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Francis Wurtz,", "english": "Francis Wurtz, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group . \u2013 (FR) Mr President, of all the peremptory judgments expressed so far with regard to the cartoons of Mohammed, there are few I find very convincing. This issue lends itself to all kinds of oversimplification and I believe that this is a trap that we must avoid at all costs. It is urgent that we reflect on the various facets of the problems we are facing calmly and in depth.\nFirst of all, there is the issue of freedom of expression, clearly the touchstone of democracy and also the touchstone of the existence of a secular public space to which we quite rightly attach great importance. In this space, a critical spirit, a personal relationship to one\u2019s faith and tolerance are supposed to prevail. These principles must not be compromised, but at the same time let us agree that the defence of these principles must not allow for insults, generalisations or stigmatisation, let alone justify them. We are constantly saying that we all live in the same world, a world that is getting smaller, in which everything is interdependent and of which neither Europe, the West in general, or any other region, is the centre. We must draw every possible conclusion from this. We are constantly being watched by the whole of humanity. We must therefore strive to create a kind of global public spirit. Everybody must exercise their freedom while respecting everybody else.\nOn the other hand, what should we make of the entirely disproportionate reactions of certain Arab States to these incidents, which are surely intended above all to restore the rather tarnished reputation of their leaders amongst their populations, resulting from their submission to a great power that is far more blameworthy than peaceful Denmark? Elsewhere, the Islamic radicals compete with the European far right to exploit this kind of issue to galvanise their respective troops and to silence the reasonable, courageous and progressive voices with whom they are battling. The worst thing would therefore be inadvertently to fuel their cause, rather than doing everything possible to break this vicious circle.\nWe must look beyond this current unrest and the entirely unacceptable excesses that it has generated, and consider the absolutely essential issue that lies behind it, that is to say the heightened expressions of identities wounded by a profound sense of injustice, domination and humiliation, for which the West, from Palestine to Iraq in particular, is responsible.\nAs the great Palestinian poet, Mahmoud Darwish, stresses in a more general sense: 'Arabs and Muslims have the impression of being pushed outside of history'. It is here that I believe Europe could play an essential role: building bridges between civilisations. But in order for that ambition to be credible, it means being fully liberated from those who, while behaving like the masters of the world, are in reality leading it \u2013\u00a0we see this a little more every day\u00a0\u2013 to the brink of a clash. That also means applying the same international law to all States without exception, in order in particular to put an end to the open wound in the Middle East, which is an endless source of the poison of despair. The unfortunate cartoons affair should serve to illustrate the strategic options that we are facing!\n(Applause from the left)", "lang": "FR", "original": "Francis Wurtz, au nom du groupe GUE/NGL . - Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, parmi tous les jugements p\u00e9remptoires suscit\u00e9s jusqu\u2019ici par l\u2019affaire dite des caricatures de Mahomet, peu m\u2019ont paru convaincants. Le sujet se pr\u00eate \u00e0 tous les manich\u00e9ismes et je pense que c\u2019est un pi\u00e8ge dont il faut sortir \u00e0 tout prix. Une r\u00e9flexion sereine et nuanc\u00e9e me semble urgente sur les diverses facettes du probl\u00e8me auquel nous sommes confront\u00e9s.\nTout d\u2019abord, il y a la question de la libert\u00e9 d\u2019expression, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9vidence pierre de touche de la d\u00e9mocratie et \u00e9galement pierre de touche de l\u2019existence d\u2019un espace public la\u00efc \u00e0 laquelle nous attachons une importance l\u00e9gitime.

Ne transigeons pas avec ces acquis, mais convenons en m\u00eame temps que la d\u00e9fense de ces principes ne saurait s\u2019accommoder de l\u2019insulte, de l\u2019amalgame, de la stigmatisation, et encore moins les justifier. Nous ne cessons de dire que nous vivons tous dans le m\u00eame monde, de plus en plus petit, o\u00f9 tout est interd\u00e9pendant et dont ni l\u2019Europe, ni l\u2019Occident en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, ni aucune autre r\u00e9gion n\u2019est le centre.

Ailleurs, ce sont les islamistes radicaux qui rivalisent avec les extr\u00e9mistes de droite europ\u00e9ens dans l\u2019instrumentalisation de telles affaires pour galvaniser leurs troupes respectives et faire taire les voix raisonnables, courageuses et progressistes qui leur disputent le terrain. La pire des choses serait donc d\u2019apporter, \u00e0 notre corps d\u00e9fendant, de l\u2019eau \u00e0 leur moulin au lieu de tout faire pour rompre ce cercle vicieux.\nInt\u00e9ressons-nous plut\u00f4t, derri\u00e8re cet embrasement conjoncturel et par-del\u00e0 les exc\u00e8s tout \u00e0 fait condamnables qu\u2019il engendre, \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il r\u00e9v\u00e8le de tout \u00e0 fait essentiel, \u00e0 savoir l\u2019expression exacerb\u00e9e d\u2019identit\u00e9s bless\u00e9es par un profond sentiment d\u2019injustice, de domination, d\u2019humiliation, dont l\u2019Occident, de la Palestine \u00e0 l\u2019Iraq en particulier, est rendu responsable.\nComme le souligne plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement le grand po\u00e8te palestinien Mahmoud Darwich: \u00abArabes et musulmans ont le sentiment d\u2019\u00eatre pouss\u00e9s hors de l\u2019histoire\u00bb.

The proposal is amending exchange programs and opening markets.\n\nI need to make sure there's no other info on him. The rest of the summary doesn't mention him again.

It is equally shameful how today again, in a grovelling and cowardly fashion, the most carefully chosen words of solidarity are immediately followed by all kinds of caveats so as not to offend the Islamofanatics.\nWe should all feel Danish, because the criminal campaigns mounted against embassies, the boycott of Danish products, the threats and violent demonstrations are, in fact, directed against freedom and against the West as a whole. Anyone who responds to this threat with a scantily disguised appeal for self-censorship becomes, in fact, an ally of terror.\nCan I, in fact, repeat in this Chamber the question for which the editor-in-chief of a Jordanian newspaper was arrested and put behind bars? What would cause more prejudice against Islam \u2013 the publication of a few caricatures, or images of Islamic hostage takers who cut the throats of their victims in front of the camera? Can I also ask the question whether anywhere in the world, there is one Islamic country where atheists or people adhering to other faiths are given the respect that Muslims demand from us?\nTo ask the question is to answer it, and it is therefore high time we stopped beating about the bush and asked Muslims who live in Europe and who, by the way, enjoy freedom of religion, the free expression of opinion and all the blessings of social security, quite rightly so, to take themselves less seriously and to realise that democracy is about differences of opinion and sometimes clashing viewpoints.\nAnyone who cannot live with this would do well to use their freedom to move to one of the many countries where the inflexible and often very cruel laws of Islam already apply.\nI would like to quote the Danish Queen Margarethe II, with whom I am in complete agreement and who appears to be much more spirited than most European leaders put together: \u2018These days, we are being challenged by Islam nationally and internationally. We have left this issue unaddressed for far too long, because we were tolerant or even perhaps complacent. We must show our opposition to Islam and accept the risk of being given unfavourable labels at times\u2019.\nLet us therefore defend, tooth and nail, the free expression of opinion. Let the European countries where laws inimical to liberty are already in place to curb the free expression of political opinion \u2013 Belgium for example \u2013 take the initiative to abolish these laws which muzzle people and thereby send a strong message to anyone who combats freedom.\nWe should also draw lessons from this for the negotiations with Turkey, because Turkey can never become a European Member State, simply because it is not a European country, and also because the basic principles of Islam are incompatible with the European values of freedom, separation of church and state and gender equality. It is time we mustered the courage to say this, certainly now Prime Minister Erdogan has been arrogant enough to seek to impose restrictions on the free expression of opinion.\nOn a final note about this Danish issue, I should like to add an impressive quote from Mrs\u00a0Doornaert\u2019s column in the Flemish newspaper De Standaard : \u2018Europe appears to be unable to shake off its tendency for appeasement. It should have learnt by now that it is impossible to appease a totalitarian monster. The more you feed it, the more insolent it becomes\u2019. Mrs\u00a0Doornaert and her newspaper certainly do not think along the same political lines as I do, but those are prophetic words and we would do well to ponder them very carefully.", "lang": "NL", "original": "Frank Vanhecke (NI). - Voorzitter, al bij al is het volgens mij eigenlijk beschamend hoe weinig solidariteit met Denemarken de meeste Europese regeringen in deze zaak hebben betoond en ook is het beschamend hoe kruiperig en laf men na de meeste, zeer voorzichtige solidariteitswoorden ook vandaag weer onmiddellijk allerhande formules laat volgen om toch vooral maar niet de islamfanatici voor het hoofd te stoten.\nWij zouden ons vandaag nochtans allen Denen moeten voelen, want de misdadige acties tegen ambassades, de boycot van Deense producten, de bedreigingen en de gewelddadige betogingen zijn eigenlijk tegen de vrijheid en tegen het hele vrije Westen gericht. Wie op deze dreiging antwoordt met een nauwelijks verholen oproep tot zelfcensuur, maakt zich tot een objectieve bondgenoot van de terreur.\nMag ik hier trouwens eens de vraag herhalen waarvoor de hoofdredacteur van een Jordaanse krant werd gearresteerd en achter de tralies gezet: wat zou voor meer vooroordelen tegen de islam zorgen, de publicatie van een paar karikaturen of de beelden van islamitische gijzelnemers die voor de camera hun slachtoffers de keel oversnijden? Mag ik ook eens de vraag stellen of er ergens ter wereld ook maar \u00e9\u00e9n islamland bestaat waar ongelovigen of andersgelovigen het respect krijgen dat de moslims van ons eisen?\nDe vraag stellen is ze beantwoorden en het wordt dus hoog tijd om klare taal te spreken en ook de moslims die in Europa leven, en die hier tussen haakjes, terecht trouwens, onbekommerd genieten van godsdienstvrijheid, vrije meningsuiting en alle zegeningen van onze sociale voorzieningen, te vragen zichzelf wat te relativeren en te beseffen dat de democratie een kwestie is van woord en wederwoord en soms ook van zeer botsende standpunten.\nWie daar niet mee kan leven, gebruikt dan maar het best de vrijheid om te verhuizen naar een van de vele landen waar de onbuigzame en dikwijls bijzonder wrede wetten van de islam reeds gelden.\nIk ben het volledig eens met de Deense koningin Margaretha II, die veel moediger blijkt te zijn dan zowat alle Europese gezagsdragers samen en die ik dan ook graag citeer: \"Wij worden deze dagen nationaal en internationaal door de islam uitgedaagd. Wij hebben dit onderwerp veel te lang terzijde gelaten, omdat wij tolerant en misschien wel lui waren. Wij moeten ons verzet tegen de islam tonen en dan soms ook maar het risico lopen om weinig flatterende labels opgeplakt te krijgen\".\nLaten we de vrije meningsuiting dus met hand en tand verdedigen. Laat de Europese landen waar op dit ogenblik reeds liberticide wetten bestaan waarmee de politieke vrije meningsuiting aan banden wordt gelegd, Belgi\u00eb bijvoorbeeld, nu maar het initiatief nemen om deze muilkorfwetten af te schaffen en zo een duidelijk signaal te geven aan al wie de vrijheid bekampt.\nLaten we ook lessen trekken voor de onderhandelingen met Turkije, want Turkije kan nooit een Europese lidstaat worden, omdat het doodeenvoudig geen Europees land is, maar ook omdat de basisbeginselen van de islam onverenigbaar zijn met de Europese waarden van vrijheid, scheiding van kerk en staat en gelijkwaardigheid van man en vrouw. Het wordt tijd dat we de moed hebben dit ook te zeggen, zeker nu premier Erdogan de arrogantie vertoont om ons beperkingen van de vrije meningsuiting te willen opleggen.\nTot slot over deze hele Deense kwestie nog een indrukwekkend citaat uit de column van mevrouw Doornaert in de Vlaamse krant De Standaard: \"Europa lijkt maar niet los te komen van zijn neiging tot apeacement. Nochtans zou het al geleerd moeten hebben dat je een totalitair monster niet kunt paaien. Hoe meer je het voedt, hoe driester het wordt\".

The debate that we have held here today will also make the Council\u2019s job easier in future.\nOn behalf of the Council, I wish to reiterate what I said in my introductory statement \u2013 which has also been said by the President of the Commission and also very many speakers: any attack on a Member State of the EU, any boycott against a Member State of the EU, is an attack on the EU, and we of course stand in solidarity with Denmark. This I say also on behalf of the Council.\nA number of very interesting ideas have been put forward here, which the Council will be happy to take up. I agree with Mr\u00a0Poettering that it is important to reach out also \u2013 or particularly \u2013 to the young people: in schools, and also at home, as their education naturally begins at home. I also agree with Mr\u00a0Poettering that it is important to avoid stereotypes and clich\u00e9s in school books, too, and so I think that the idea of examining these is a good one.\nI could not agree more with Mr\u00a0Rasmussen on the importance of dialogue between civilisations and on the need for the dialogue to be open, critical and respectful: that seems to me to be most important. Indeed, extremists must not be allowed to triumph: this is a fundamental statement that must be made here. It goes without saying that no benefit should induce us to bow down to extremists: we must show solidarity and unity on this. I could not agree more with Mr\u00a0Cohn-Bendit, and I also said in my statement that I, too, am of the opinion that the responsibility of the press is a personal one, and that governments should not tell it what it can or cannot do.\nI am aware that, over the years and decades, institutions such as the Council of Europe have made repeated attempts to draw up a code of conduct; all of which have failed. I believe that this is a personal responsibility; that is very important.\nIn the same spirit shown by today\u2019s debate, the Council will continue to work on improving understanding between civilisations and between religious communities, but will also speak in plain terms when it comes to rejecting violence, and when it comes to condemning the use of violence or boycotts against Member States of the EU. We must show solidarity on this.\n(Applause)", "lang": "DE", "original": "Hans Winkler, amtierender Ratspr\u00e4sident . Herr Pr\u00e4sident, meine sehr verehrten Damen und Herren!

Ich halte es darum f\u00fcr eine gute Anregung, hier eine \u00dcberpr\u00fcfung vorzunehmen.\nIch kann mit Herrn Rasmussen nur \u00fcbereinstimmen, wie wichtig der Dialog der Zivilisationen ist und dass wir einen offenen, kritischen, respektvollen Dialog miteinander brauchen.

Selbstverst\u00e4ndlich geht es nicht darum, vor Extremisten in die Knie zu gehen, wegen irgendwelcher Vorteile. Hier m\u00fcssen wir uns einig und solidarisch sein. Ich kann Herrn Cohn-Bendit nur zustimmen, und ich habe das auch gesagt in meiner Erkl\u00e4rung, dass ich auch der Meinung bin, dass die Verantwortung der Presse eine Eigenverantwortung ist, und dass es nicht darum geht, dass Regierungen der Presse sagen, was sie tun k\u00f6nnen oder was sie nicht tun k\u00f6nnen.\nIch wei\u00df, dass \u00fcber die Jahre, die Jahrzehnte im Europarat und in anderen Institutionen immer wieder der Versuch unternommen wurde, Verhaltenskodizes aufzustellen; sie sind alle gescheitert.

Wait, the debate summary mentions various speakers like Hans Winkler, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, etc. But the user is asking about \"President.\" However, in the debate summary, there's no specific mention of a \"President\" as a speaker. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the debate summary, the speakers listed include Hans Winkler (Council President), Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, Daniel Marc Cohn-Bendit, and others. The user might be referring to Hans Winkler as the \"President\" since he's the Council President. But the user's instruction says the speaker's name is \"President,\" which might be a placeholder. However, in the actual debate summary, there's no separate \"President\" speaker beyond Hans Winkler. \n\nAssuming that \"President\" refers to Hans Winkler, let's check his contributions. In the summary, Hans Winkler's points include emphasizing freedom of expression as a key European value, supporting the defense of free speech, and mentioning the responsibility of the press. He also talks about the need for dialogue and the role of the EU in fostering relations. \n\nBut the user's example response structure requires issueSum, positionSum, argSum, propSum.

The arguments would be that freedom of expression is essential and not negotiable, but must be exercised responsibly. Proposals include dialogue initiatives like involving Turkey, UN meetings, and EU-Islamic world dialogue.\n\nBut the user's example response is about the Data Act, which is different. However, in this case, the user's query is about the debate on freedom of expression and religious beliefs. So, the answer should be based on the provided debate summary. However, if the speaker \"President\" isn't explicitly mentioned, maybe there are no points. But the user might have intended Hans Winkler. However, the user's instruction says to only include points attributed to the speaker named. If the debate summary doesn't have a \"President\" as a speaker, then the answer would be empty. But the user's example includes a \"President\" in the speaker name. Wait, maybe in the debate, the \"President\" refers to the speaker of the parliament or someone else. Let me check the debate summary again.\n\nLooking at the debate summary under \"positions on freedom of expression,\" Hans Winkler is mentioned as the Council President. So perhaps the user is referring to him as \"President.\" Therefore, the points would be based on his contributions.

PositionSum: supports free expression as a fundamental value, emphasizes responsibility, opposes government control. ArgSum: argues that freedom of expression is essential and not negotiable, but must be exercised responsibly. PropSum: proposes dialogue initiatives like involving Turkey, UN meetings, and EU-Islamic dialogue.\n\nBut the user's example response has specific fields. So the JSON should reflect that. However, the user's instruction says if there are no points, return an empty string. But since the \"President\" (Hans Winkler) did make points, the answer should include those.

The user provided a parliamentary debate summary about the Right to Freedom of Expression and Respect for Religious Beliefs, specifically focusing on Ana Maria Gomes (PSE). My task is to extract her main points, positions, arguments, and proposals from the debate summary.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the debate summary and find any mentions of Ana Maria Gomes. Scanning through the sections, I see a part under \"Divergent Perspectives\" where she is mentioned. The summary states: \"Ana Maria Gomes criticized the resolution as 'unbalanced' for not adequately addressing 'the islamophobic intentions behind the cartoons published by an extreme right-wing, racist and xenophobic newspaper.'\"\n\nSo, her main point is that the resolution didn't address the Islamophobic intent behind the cartoons. She's pointing out a flaw in the debate's approach. The issue here is the lack of attention to the underlying Islamophobic motives. Her position is that the resolution was unbalanced. The argument she's making is that the cartoons had Islamophobic intentions, which the resolution didn't properly address. However, the summary doesn't mention any specific proposals she made beyond this criticism. \n\nI need to structure this into the required JSON fields. The \"issueSum\" would be about the Islamophobic intentions in the cartoons not being addressed. The \"positionSum\" is her criticism of the resolution as unbalanced. The \"argSum\" is her reasoning that the resolution didn't tackle the Islamophobic aspects. There's no mention of proposals, so \"propSum\" should be an empty string.\n\nI need to make sure I don't include any other speakers' points. The user specified to only include what's attributed to Ana Maria Gomes. Let me double-check the summary again to confirm there's nothing else. The rest of the debate details other speakers, but her contributions are only in that one sentence. So the JSON should reflect that.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The speaker highlighted the need to address the Islamophobic intentions behind the Danish newspaper cartoons depicting Prophet Muhammad.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"She criticized the resolution as 'unbalanced' for failing to adequately address the islamophobic motives underlying the cartoons.\",\n\"argSum\": \"Her argument centered on the assertion that the cartoons were published with 'islamophobic intentions' by an extreme right-wing, racist, and xenophobic newspaper, which the resolution did not sufficiently acknowledge.\",\n\"propSum\": \"\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}]
