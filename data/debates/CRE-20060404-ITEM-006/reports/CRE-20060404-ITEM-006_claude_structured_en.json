It was during the past year that the Commission first presented them, and I am grateful to your House for giving them such close attention, for they will be a guide \u2013 not only during this year but also thereafter \u2013 to what we are considering doing and to the basis on which we will be doing it.\nThe fact is that the growth and employment strategy, which we have been trying to implement for something like a year, is a completely new kind of process. It is not yet altogether straightforward to pass final judgment on the elements of this new process, but one thing can be said today, albeit with a great deal of caution, and that is that the Member States have in their national reform programmes, basically allowed themselves to be guided by the priorities set out in the integrated economic guidelines, as has the Commission with its proposal for a Community action programme.\nIt is important that I should point out that the growth and employment strategy is based on a three-year cycle. What that means is that there is no intention that the guidelines should be amended from one year to another. They may well, though, be adapted to take account of changed realities and the insights that we gain from experience, and that will, of course be necessary, but we do not, at present, see any reason why these guidelines should be amended for 2006; they are still a sound basis for the dialogues in which the Commission is currently engaged with the Member States, the object of which is to get the national reform programmes actually up and running.\n(Applause)\nAs for the individual pillars of this strategy, my fellow-Commissioners Mr Almunia and Mr \u0160pidla will have something more to say about its macro-economic and employment aspects. I would like, briefly, to discuss its micro-economic dimension and highlight the significant advances that have been made in this respect in some areas, particularly as regards the key issue for Europe\u2019s economic future, namely the transition to a knowledge-based society and its becoming an economy founded on innovation, research and development. It was for that reason that we were so insistent on imposing quantitative targets for research and development.\nYou will be aware that this was an area in which the national reform programmes produced rather disappointing results, for they would, on average, have brought us up to 2.2% by 2010 instead of the desired 3%. In the few weeks this year in which we have been able to address this issue, we have, however, been able to get the Member States to commit significantly more. If they stick to them, we will be able to achieve 2.6% by 2010, which is an improvement, but \u2013 and I have to make this clear \u2013 it is not enough, and so the Commission will continue to bring pressure to bear on them.\nThe European Council, held the week before last and which you will be discussing tomorrow, also discussed, and came to conclusions on, important aspects of the strategy\u2019s implementation; I would refer you in particular to the Council resolutions on the promotion of small and medium-sized businesses, on improving the lawmaking process and on energy policy.\nFrom time to time, the question is discussed \u2013 in connection with the guidelines \u2013 of whether the Commission, when assessing the national reform plans in future, should or should not hand down recommendations specific to the countries in question.

(ES) Mr President, I agree with the assessment that Vice-President Verheugen has just made on the way in which we are implementing the revised Lisbon Strategy that we implemented last year.\nOn reading Mr Garc\u00eda-Margallo\u2019s report on the European economy and the broad economic policy guidelines, I note a considerable degree of agreement, and we also noted this agreement within the Commission, with the same objectives and the same process towards achieving them, at the last European Council. I believe that this fundamental agreement amongst the three European institutions is crucial to the credibility of the process, the acceptance of the objectives of this strategy by all economic and social actors, and not just the European and national institutions, and is one of the conditions \u2013 which I believe to be essential \u2013 for achieving greater growth and employment in the European Union.\nWith regard to macroeconomic issues, I would like to refer to three points. Firstly, it is clear that, as we have said on many occasions, and I believe that we agree with Parliament\u2019s opinion, it was important to achieve greater synchronisation amongst the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy, in order to achieve more growth and more employment, and the application of the Stability and Growth Pact. Over the last year, this has been achieved. There is more coordination and a better relationship between them and I believe that we are achieving very positive results in practice. The European economy is making better progress today towards fiscal consolidation than it was a year ago, as one of the necessary conditions for more solid growth and growth that is capable of generating employment. The confidence of the economic actors is improving, the results of activity suggest that 2006 is going to offer better results than in 2005 and the perspectives opening up for the future are also positive.\nSecondly, I entirely agree with what Mr\u00a0Garc\u00eda-Margallo\u2019s report says with regard to the importance of paying more attention to the sustainability of public finances and, in particular, with regard to how to deal with the consequences of the ageing of the population. A few weeks ago, the Commission and the Economic Policy Committee, which is made up of all of the Member States, published a report on the economic and budgetary consequences of the ageing of the population. These consequences are significant, but that report also notes that, by acting on time and carrying out reforms, such as those included in many national Lisbon Strategy programmes and those which the different Member States are promoting by means of their initiatives, in particular Commissioner \u0160pidla\u2019s initiatives in the demographic field, results can be seen, and there are now European countries that are in a better position today than five years ago to deal with the consequences of the ageing of the population. In October, the Commission is going to publish a report on this issue, which I hope will also be debated and monitored in Parliament.\nA final point.

(CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs K\u00f3s\u00e1n\u00e9 Kov\u00e1cs, on behalf of the Commission for the excellent report that has been presented by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. This report is constructive in two ways: it adds to the underlying body of knowledge and it ought to speed up adoption by the Council, in comparison with previous years.\nAt the spring session of the European Council it was stated that the Union would be capable of creating 2\u00a0million jobs per year. Yet job creation and cuts in unemployment will not happen unless we take advantage of the current economic growth to continue with the necessary reforms. The session provided confirmation that the integrated guidelines remain valid, at the same time setting out which priorities would be attracting greater emphasis. I am delighted that the parliamentary committee is advocating a similar approach and that it has not agreed to any excessive changes to the underlying principles of employment policy. We are amenable to changes in the points of justification, but by the same token we want to stick with the original wording of the text itself.\nLast year the Lisbon Strategy was redefined in respect of the integrated set of basic principles behind employment policy and the guidelines for economic policy. The Strategy has a tri-annual nature, in the interests of creating a clear and stable political framework for the bodies entrusted with its implementation. A study carried out by the Commission into the first of the national reform programmes has uncovered specific shortcomings in respect of Member State implementation, although these do not undermine the validity of the basic principles. It would therefore be inappropriate to give the impression that we wish to change the direction or content of the policies at this point.

(CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs K\u00f3s\u00e1n\u00e9 Kov\u00e1cs, on behalf of the Commission for the excellent report that has been presented by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. This report is constructive in two ways: it adds to the underlying body of knowledge and it ought to speed up adoption by the Council, in comparison with previous years.\nAt the spring session of the European Council it was stated that the Union would be capable of creating 2\u00a0million jobs per year. Yet job creation and cuts in unemployment will not happen unless we take advantage of the current economic growth to continue with the necessary reforms. The session provided confirmation that the integrated guidelines remain valid, at the same time setting out which priorities would be attracting greater emphasis. I am delighted that the parliamentary committee is advocating a similar approach and that it has not agreed to any excessive changes to the underlying principles of employment policy. We are amenable to changes in the points of justification, but by the same token we want to stick with the original wording of the text itself.\nLast year the Lisbon Strategy was redefined in respect of the integrated set of basic principles behind employment policy and the guidelines for economic policy. The Strategy has a tri-annual nature, in the interests of creating a clear and stable political framework for the bodies entrusted with its implementation. A study carried out by the Commission into the first of the national reform programmes has uncovered specific shortcomings in respect of Member State implementation, although these do not undermine the validity of the basic principles. It would therefore be inappropriate to give the impression that we wish to change the direction or content of the policies at this point. The text proposed by the Commission deliberately left open the possibility of supplementing the points of justification with specific political priorities. It therefore clearly goes along with Parliament\u2019s desire to include in the points of justification some elements of an economic and social nature which require particular attention, especially where they accord with the conclusions of the latest spring session of the European Council.\nThe session placed an emphasis on the need to increase employment especially among young people, women, older people and people with health problems, legitimate migrants and minorities.

Unfortunately, the \u2018Lisbon process\u2019 is starting to become a code phrase too, even though it represents our common future. If the Member States of the Union are competitive, we will have more and better jobs. If more people find jobs, poverty will be reduced. Also, this would provide more resources for the reform of social systems, and to enable us to preserve our environment for our grandchildren. I would like to strongly emphasise that work that is not accompanied by and founded on social security cannot produce significant economic results. And if this is true, which it is, then we can welcome the decision of the Council and Commission, that Member States should assess the implementation of the Directives on employment and economic development in integrated Directives, evaluating the two issues in connection with one another. We can see that the picture has become richer, especially through the fact that the European Commission has now assessed the action plans of 25 Member States. The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has acknowledged and accepted that on the basis of the Interinstitutional Agreements, Parliament will not change the guidelines annually \u2013 and I believe that this will also serve the interests of the Member States \u2013 and it will only change them in the event of any problems arising on the employment market of the European Union. At the same time, in the specifications of political aims \u2013 contained in the preamble \u2013 we considered it important to include in the parliamentary document the lessons learned from the first report prepared after the ten new Member States joined the European Union. The committee agreed, almost unanimously, that Parliament should participate more actively in the verification of the implementation of the guidelines. In this respect, we will contact the competent Commission official. In my report I wished to complement the presentation of the Commission in respect of three important matters of principle; my colleagues, the members of the committee, have made a significant contribution to insure that these are presented clearly and comprehensively. Primarily, we emphatically call attention to the improvement of the labour market opportunities of social groups with various disadvantages. And, as mentioned by the Commissioners, this is also a precondition of further economic growth. A huge reserve for increasing labour resources is firstly to increase the activity of women, secondly, to maintain the ageing or aged workforce on the labour market or to encourage their return, and thirdly, to help young people find jobs and enter the labour market. However, we believe that the elimination of the disadvantages that keep away a part of the people from the labour market today is at least as important. We also call attention to the anomaly that workers coming from third countries may have a more favourable position on the European labour market than citizens of new Member States. We will have the opportunity to discuss this problem in connection with the \u0150 ry report, but I would already like to say, on the basis of the news we have recently heard, that we welcome the Netherlands to the \u2018club of the 6\u2019 (as the seventh country, from 2007). And finally, thirdly, we believe that without a long-term financial perspective it is not possible to provide adequate resources to Member States for the tasks that are specified as fundamental goals in the integrated guidelines either.\nPolite words are fashionable here, but this is not politeness or force of habit: I would like to say a sincere thank you to my colleagues \u2013 irrespective of their party affiliation \u2013 and to the representatives of the various political groups for their help and contribution, and separately to Ana Mato Adrover, the co-rapporteur of the report.

What can we do to ensure that our reports are heard? And thirdly, what is it that we want the Commission to hear?\nFirstly, why a report? Because previous reports contained masses of recommendations that the Commission has not taken into account. Secondly, because, since we discussed the previous report, new factors have arisen: the relative failure of the European Constitution, a new financial perspective, some first interest rate rises, three candidates seeking to join the eurozone, and the Doha Round, which continues the Hong Kong trade talks.\nSecondly, because there are certain factors that we have taken up in other reports, but which have become more important over time. Commissioner Almunia referred to the ageing of the population and we should also talk about the consequences of immigration, the consequences of Chinese imports, once the quantitative restrictions have come to an end, about world imbalances, essentially in relation to the United States, and finally the energy crisis.\nWhat can we do in order to be heard? This report has been drawn up in a spirit of consensus, which has obliged many of us to give way on our particular points of view, and I would like in particular to thank all of the representatives of the other parliamentary groups for doing so.\nIf we want to be heard, the first thing I must point out here is that previously we have not been heard. This report begins with a kind of catalogue of grievances, a list of recommendations that we have made and that the Commission has not taken up.\nWe asked for a transposition of directives, which has not happened, a reduction of deficits \u2014 Commissioner Almunia has pointed out that 12 of the 25 Member States are currently in a situation of excessive deficit \u2014 a communication on globalisation in order to make clear to the public the opportunities and challenges it presents \u2014 and if this communication had been produced, it would have spared us a few headaches \u2014 and we also called for the application of the charters on small and medium-sized businesses, something which has not been done.\nSecondly, this report deals with what we might call institutional issues, whether of a constitutional nature or not. During this period of active reflection \u2014 which is neither a reflection nor active \u2014 we are dealing with those questions which were left over from the Convention and which have not been answered: what are the Union\u2019s objectives and competences? What are the responsibilities of the European Central Bank, while respecting its independence at all times? What should we do in order to reinforce the Stability and Growth Pact? What are the legal bases for modifying taxation in the Union and in the Member States?\nThere is one explicit recommendation that I would ask the Commission to take particular note of: this Parliament will not approve any directive by means of the Lamfalussy procedure if the problem of call-back is not resolved by 2008, ultimately the international representation of the eurozone.\nThe Vice-President of the Commission has referred to coordinating the broad economic policy guidelines and the employment guidelines within a single document: it is true, but they are still subject to different information and consultation procedures which make them difficult to understand. Furthermore, it is necessary to incorporate other documents in order to ensure that it is not fragmentary.\nWith regard to taxation in an institutional sense, we call upon the Commission to respond to what the High Court of Justice has said: a uniform definition of tax residence, as an extension of citizenship, the principle of non-discrimination and a convention on double taxation. With regard to coordination, I was pleased with Commissioner Almunia\u2019s kind words: it is true that we have to coordinate more, we must make a precise diagnosis, draw up a correct cure, an analysis of what has happened and define the role of the Eurogroup.\nIn the field of macroeconomic policy, we do not go into the issue of interest rates, we do not express our opinion. We do say that we have to do everything possible to ensure that prices do not rise and interest stays low. We refer to public debt, in terms used by the Commissioner: less interest, less repayments, means more spending on ageing, more Lisbon.\nWith regard to the business climate, we call for serious reflection. The United States are ahead of us. 144 of the world\u2019s top companies are from the European Union, while in the case of the United States, that figure stands at 206. Small and medium-sized businesses double their employment in the first two years, something that does not happen in Europe. We are calling for positive discrimination to be applied in favour of small and medium-sized businesses, with particular reference to the funding of risk capital.\nIn the field of taxation, to put it in simple terms, we ask that Home State Taxation be used for companies in application of the principle of place of origin with regard to VAT.\nI have nothing to say with regard to human capital. My colleague has expressed this very well.\nIn the field of investment: trans-European networks. It would take twenty years to finish them.\nEnergy, R+D+I, more market, more competition, more competitiveness.\n(Applause)", "lang": "ES", "original": "Jos\u00e9 Manuel Garc\u00eda-Margallo y Marfil (PPE-DE), ponente . \u2013 (ES) Se\u00f1or Presidente, se\u00f1ores Comisarios, la discusi\u00f3n sobre las grandes orientaciones econ\u00f3micas nos ha dado bastantes dolores de cabeza en a\u00f1os anteriores.\nPara que este a\u00f1o el dolor de cabeza sea m\u00e1s liviano, me voy a limitar a tres cuestiones: \u00bfpor qu\u00e9 el Parlamento ha decidido hacer un informe a pesar de que la Comisi\u00f3n ha optado por ratificar los informes anteriores? \u00bfQu\u00e9 podemos hacer para que nuestros informes sean o\u00eddos? Y, en tercer lugar, \u00bfqu\u00e9 es lo que queremos que la Comisi\u00f3n oiga?\nEn primer lugar, \u00bfpor qu\u00e9 un informe? Porque hay un mont\u00f3n de recomendaciones, hechas en informes anteriores, que la Comisi\u00f3n no ha tenido en cuenta. En segundo lugar, porque, desde que discutimos el informe anterior, han surgido factores nuevos: el fracaso relativo de la Constituci\u00f3n Europea, unas nuevas perspectivas financieras, unas primeras subidas de inter\u00e9s, tres candidatos que aspiran a entrar en la zona del euro, y la Ronda de Doha, que contin\u00faa las conversaciones comerciales de Hong Kong.\nEn segundo lugar, porque hay ciertos factores que s\u00ed fueron tenidos en cuenta en otros informes, pero que han cobrado un protagonismo mayor a lo largo del tiempo. Se ha referido el Comisario Almunia al envejecimiento de la poblaci\u00f3n y deber\u00edamos hablar tambi\u00e9n de las consecuencias de la inmigraci\u00f3n, de las consecuencias de las importaciones chinas, una vez que han terminado las restricciones cuantitativas, de los desequilibrios mundiales, fundamentalmente de los Estados Unidos, y, por \u00faltimo, del shock energ\u00e9tico.\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 debemos hacer para ser o\u00eddos? Este informe ha sido redactado con un esp\u00edritu de consenso, lo cual nos ha obligado a muchos a hacer muchas renuncias de nuestros pensamientos particulares, renuncias que yo agradezco especialmente a todos los representantes de los otros Grupos parlamentarios.\nY, si queremos ser o\u00eddos, lo primero que tengo que se\u00f1alar aqu\u00ed es que antes no lo hemos sido.

Se abordan en este periodo de reflexi\u00f3n activa \u2014que ni es reflexi\u00f3n ni es activa\u2014 aquellas preguntas que quedaron pendientes en la Convenci\u00f3n y que no han sido contestadas: \u00bfcu\u00e1les son los objetivos y competencias de la Uni\u00f3n? \u00bfCu\u00e1l es la responsabilidad del Banco Central Europeo, respetando siempre su independencia? \u00bfQu\u00e9 hacer para reforzar el Pacto de estabilidad y crecimiento? \u00bfCu\u00e1les son las bases jur\u00eddicas para modificar la fiscalidad en la Uni\u00f3n y en los Estados miembros?\nUna recomendaci\u00f3n expl\u00edcita de la que yo rogar\u00eda que la Comisi\u00f3n tomase nota: este Parlamento no aprobar\u00e1 ninguna directiva por el procedimiento Lamfalussy si antes de 2008 no se resuelve el problema del call back o de la avocaci\u00f3n, en \u00faltima instancia representaci\u00f3n internacional de la zona del euro.\nSe ha referido el Vicepresidente de la Comisi\u00f3n a la coordinaci\u00f3n en un solo documento de las GOPES y de las orientaciones de empleo: es verdad, pero siguen sometidas a procedimientos diferentes, informaci\u00f3n y consulta, que dificultan su comprensi\u00f3n. Es necesario, adem\u00e1s, incorporar otros documentos para que esto no sea fragmentario.\nEn materia de fiscalidad de car\u00e1cter institucional, pedimos que la Comisi\u00f3n se haga eco de lo que ya ha dicho el Tribunal Superior de Justicia: residencia \u00fanica, como extensi\u00f3n de la ciudadan\u00eda, principio de no discriminaci\u00f3n y convenio de doble imposici\u00f3n. Y, en materia de coordinaci\u00f3n, celebro las amables palabras del Comisario Almunia: es verdad que tenemos que coordinar m\u00e1s, tenemos que hacer un diagn\u00f3stico exacto, una terapia exacta, un an\u00e1lisis de lo que ha pasado y definir el papel del Eurogrupo.\nEn materia de pol\u00edtica macroecon\u00f3mica, no entramos en el tema de los tipos de inter\u00e9s, no exponemos nuestra opini\u00f3n. S\u00ed decimos que hay que hacer todo lo posible para que los precios no suban y los tipos de inter\u00e9s se mantengan bajos. Hacemos una referencia a la deuda p\u00fablica, en los t\u00e9rminos que ha dicho el Comisario: menos intereses, menos amortizaciones, quiere decir m\u00e1s gastos de envejecimiento, m\u00e1s Lisboa.\nEn cuanto al clima empresarial, pedimos una reflexi\u00f3n seria. Los Estados Unidos van por delante de nosotros. La Uni\u00f3n Europea tiene 144 empresas entre las primeras del mundo, frente a las 206 de los Estados Unidos. La peque\u00f1a y la mediana empresa duplican sus efectivos en empleo en los dos primeros a\u00f1os, cosa que no ocurre en Europa. Pedimos que se aplique la discriminaci\u00f3n positiva a favor de la peque\u00f1a y la mediana empresa, haciendo especial referencia a la financiaci\u00f3n de capital-riesgo.\nEn materia de fiscalidad, pedimos, si se quiere simplificar, que se aproveche el home state taxation en sociedades para aplicar el principio de origen en valor a\u00f1adido.\nNada digo en materia de capital humano. Lo ha dicho muy bien mi colega.\nMateria de inversi\u00f3n: redes transeuropeas.

Those guidelines established the general approach to employment and the priorities for the next three years, and their purpose was to make an effective contribution to employment growth, the productivity of the economy and, of course, strengthening social inclusion and cohesion.\nThese guidelines, which were debated jointly with the economic policy guidelines, which this year have been presented brilliantly by Mr Garc\u00eda-Margallo y Marfil, have been taken up and translated into concrete objectives in the national reform plans, approved scarcely six months ago by the Member States. Both through common sense \u2013 they were approved scarcely a year ago and they are for three years \u2013 and as a result of the content of the guidelines themselves, we have simply updated them.\nOf what has this updating consisted? Three broad areas.\nFirstly, we have taken up the priority issues that have been highlighted at the big European summits held this year: firstly, investment in research, development and innovation and the spread of information technologies, an aspect which is furthest from achieving the Lisbon objectives; secondly, genuine and effective equality of opportunities, which our group has always advocated, and which includes the incorporation of women, permanent positions for them and their promotion in the workplace and, of course, equal pay; and, thirdly, we strongly advocate stable employment, and I say this because the majority of work that is being created is precarious. In my country, for example, 52% of all work created over the last two years has been temporary work, and that is unacceptable.\nSecondly, we have repeated certain fundamental issues which have not been adequately dealt with by the Commission. In the fight against accidents in the workplace we advocated a broad agreement at European level, which we believe to be essential, since in Spain, for example, 990 people lost their lives in 2005, and also help for the victims of domestic violence in finding work.\nFinally, since we are now updating them, we want this Parliament to be able to monitor the employment guidelines and compliance with them by the Member States.\n(Applause)", "lang": "ES", "original": "Ana Mato Adrover, en nombre del Grupo del PPE-DE . \u2013 (ES) Se\u00f1or Presidente, Se\u00f1or\u00edas, quiero comenzar mi intervenci\u00f3n destacando, en primer lugar, el buen trabajo y la magn\u00edfica colaboraci\u00f3n con la ponente, Magda K\u00f3s\u00e1n\u00e9 Kov\u00e1cs, a la que felicito por su esfuerzo y por el informe presentado.\nComo es sabido, hace escasamente un a\u00f1o se aprobaban las directrices de empleo, de las que tuve el honor de ser ponente en esa ocasi\u00f3n.

Tres grandes bloques.\nEn el primer bloque, hemos recogido las cuestiones prioritarias que se han venido destacando en las grandes cumbres europeas celebradas este a\u00f1o: en primer lugar, la inversi\u00f3n en investigaci\u00f3n, el desarrollo y la innovaci\u00f3n y la extensi\u00f3n de las tecnolog\u00edas de la informaci\u00f3n, uno de los aspectos que m\u00e1s nos alejan de los objetivos de Lisboa; en segundo lugar, la igualdad real y efectiva de oportunidades, por la que nuestro Grupo ha apostado siempre, y que pasa por la incorporaci\u00f3n, permanencia y promoci\u00f3n de la mujer en el empleo y, por supuesto, por la igualdad de salarios; y, en tercer lugar, la apuesta importante por el empleo estable, y digo esto porque gran parte del empleo que se est\u00e1 creando es mayoritariamente empleo precario.

We will not succeed in this objective if we do not succeed \u2013 and soon \u2013 in putting the European Union on an independent and accountable financial footing, nor will we succeed in it if we do not succeed in talking about taboo subjects, including the need for a common fiscal policy in this European Union of ours.\nThe reason I say this is that, in the economic situation in which we find ourselves, there is no longer any justification for taboos of any kind. Anyone who brings fresh air into this debate has my backing, for, if we consider the economic situation, we simply cannot afford to carry on letting debates be ritualistic and keeping fresh air out of this House and out of our debates. In 2005, our economic development lagged behind what it had been in 2004; our unemployment rate is still alarmingly high at around nine per cent, and long-term unemployment in particular is again on the rise. I am very glad to hear Commissioner Almunia say \u2013 and he has my backing for saying it \u2013 that there are indications of the economy developing in the right direction, but I have to tell him that there is no guarantee that the European Union will be able to fuel its own recovery.\nThat is why we have to talk about what needs to be put on the agenda. When will we in the European Union at last introduce a common investment policy? That is the most urgent thing we have to do. When will we start investing, as a Community, in research and development? In the last ten years, we have managed to increase that investment from 1.8% to 1.9%. When will we start on better and longer-term investment in education, with a coordinated strategy in the Member States? When will we start making use of the great potential of energy efficiency? That is where the key to the next technological revolution is to be found, so let us set to work!\nWhere, in this field, are the Member States investing money? Where is Europe-wide discussion of it being guided? Looking at the transport sector, we sometimes feel that we actually ought to rewrite Delors\u2019 White Paper in view of the many transposition deficits in this area, and if we were to face up to them and invest more, we could make progress.\nChildcare is one of the core issues. If we invest more in childcare, we get higher birthrates and more people \u2013 women in particular \u2013 into the workplace; that much is demonstrated by statistics. We support all those who want to make advances in this area.\nI urge you, once and for all, to put cooperation with this House on a proper institutional footing, and then we will no longer need \u2013 and I thank Mr Garc\u00eda-Margallo for pointing this out \u2013 to spend our time merely writing own-initiative reports, but discussions in this House will be on a different and stable basis.", "lang": "DE", "original": "Udo Bullmann, im Namen der PSE-Fraktion . \u2013 Herr Pr\u00e4sident, meine Herren Kommissare, liebe Kolleginnen und Kollegen! Wir sind uns alle einig darin, dass der Europ\u00e4ische Binnenmarkt unsere gro\u00dfe Chance ist: unsere gro\u00dfe Chance, mit rund 450 Millionen Menschen in der Globalisierung einen eigenst\u00e4ndigen Weg zu finden, der gekennzeichnet sein muss von wirtschaftlichem Wohlergehen und gesunden Finanzen, aber auch von einem Ertrag, der bei den Menschen ankommt.\nWas wir diskutieren m\u00fcssen \u2013 und da steht diese Debatte im Mittelpunkt\u00a0\u2013, ist folgende Frage: Haben wir alle Instrumente an Bord, die wir f\u00fcr diesen Weg brauchen, und setzen wir die Instrumente, die vorr\u00e4tig sind, richtig ein, um diesem Binnenmarkt den richtigen Rahmen zu geben und um auch die Prozesse der wirtschaftlichen Entwicklung nachhaltig zu beeinflussen?\nLassen Sie mich zwei Bemerkungen machen, die \u00fcber die heutige Diskussion und die Berichte hinausgehen: Wenn es uns nicht bald gelingt, die Finanzen der Europ\u00e4ischen Union auf eigenst\u00e4ndige und berechenbare F\u00fc\u00dfe zu stellen, werden wir dieser Aufgabe nicht gerecht werden. Und wenn es uns nicht bald gelingt, auch \u00fcber Tabus zu reden, auch dar\u00fcber zu reden, dass man in dieser Europ\u00e4ischen Union eine gemeinsame Steuerpolitik machen muss, werden wir unserer Aufgabe nicht gerecht werden.\nIch sage das deswegen, weil die wirtschaftliche Situation, in der wir uns befinden, keine Tabus mehr rechtfertigt. Ich unterst\u00fctze jeden, der frischen Wind in diese Diskussion bringt, weil wir, wenn wir uns die wirtschaftliche Lage vergegenw\u00e4rtigen, es uns \u00fcberhaupt nicht leisten k\u00f6nnen, weiterhin Diskussionen zu ritualisieren und frischen Wind aus unserem Haus oder aus unseren Diskussionen herauszuhalten. Wir hatten im Jahr 2005 eine wirtschaftliche Wachstumsentwicklung, die hinter das zur\u00fcckgefallen ist, was wir 2004 hatten. Wir haben weiterhin bedrohlich hohe Arbeitslosenquoten \u2013 um die neun Prozent. Und insbesondere die Langzeitarbeitslosigkeit ist wieder im Ansteigen begriffen. Ich unterst\u00fctze es sehr, und ich freue mich sehr, wenn Kommissar Almunia sagt, es gibt Anzeichen f\u00fcr eine gute wirtschaftliche Entwicklung. Aber, Herr Kommissar Almunia, es gibt keine Garantie daf\u00fcr, dass dies zu einem selbsttragenden Aufschwung in der Europ\u00e4ischen Union f\u00fchren wird.\nDeswegen m\u00fcssen wir dar\u00fcber reden, was auf die Tagesordnung geh\u00f6rt. Wann endlich fangen wir an, in der Europ\u00e4ischen Union eine gemeinsame Investitionspolitik zu machen? Dies ist das dringendste Erfordernis, dem wir uns stellen m\u00fcssen. Wann fangen wir an, in Forschung und Entwicklung gemeinschaftlich zu investieren? Wir haben es in den letzten zehn Jahren von 1,8\u00a0% gerade mal auf 1,9\u00a0% geschafft. Wann fangen wir an, besser und nachhaltiger in die Bildung zu investieren, mit einer koordinierten Strategie in den Mitgliedstaaten? Wann machen wir das gro\u00dfe Potenzial flott, das bei der Energieeffizienz liegt? Hier liegt der Schl\u00fcssel zur n\u00e4chsten technologischen Revolution. Machen wir uns an die Arbeit!\nWo sind die Investitionen der Mitgliedstaaten, wo ist die F\u00fchrung der europ\u00e4ischen Diskussion in diesem Feld? Wenn wir an das Transportwesen denken, dann m\u00fcssen wir uns manchmal fragen, ob wir eigentlich Delors\u2019 Wei\u00dfbuch neu schreiben m\u00fcssen. Jedenfalls gibt es viele Umsetzungsdefizite in diesem Bereich, die uns voranbringen k\u00f6nnten, wenn wir uns ihnen stellen und mehr investieren.\nKinderbetreuung \u2013 eines der zentralen Themen! Wer mehr in Kinderbetreuung investiert, hat h\u00f6here Geburtenraten und auch mehr Menschen \u2013 insbesondere Frauen \u2013 im Arbeitsleben; das zeigen unsere Statistiken. Wir unterst\u00fctzen all diejenigen, die hier voranschreiten wollen.\nStellen Sie die Zusammenarbeit mit dem Europ\u00e4ischen Parlament endlich auf ein vern\u00fcnftiges institutionelles Fundament!

The employment policy guidelines now not only serve as the formal basis for the national employment plans, but also make their influence felt on the shape and development of national labour markets, and so it is not a matter of indifference that the Council should simply walk off with the fourth pillar of the European employment policy, equality of opportunity for women in the labour market. Women are hit much harder by unemployment than are men; it is they, still, who do most of the part-time jobs. They still earn 15% less than men for comparable work, and they have fewer opportunities for promotion. They still find it much harder to get back into the labour market, especially where there is no universal, freely accessible and all-day childcare.\nGender mainstreaming still needs to be backed up by pro-active measures to promote the interests of women, and so I really am very grateful to Mrs K\u00f3s\u00e1n\u00e9 Kov\u00e1cs for making it possible for us to agree on a compromise, at any rate in the recitals, in order to incorporate into the guidelines measurable indicators for the promotion of equality of opportunity.\nI would also like to draw your attention to a second amendment. We want Guideline No 22 to be deleted. We believe that wages should be determined by the parties to a collective agreement, and must be kept out of political resolutions. I cannot but note, to my considerable disquiet, that there seems to be in this House a tacit agreement between the two main groups to the effect that, in future, governmental policy decisions, in the shape of national employment plans, should ensure that overall wages trends be brought into line with the rise of productivity in the economic cycle. I had thought that the planned economy with which we were familiar in the former East Germany had been banished from Europe once and for all, until I realised that the guidelines determine the support to be given by the European Social Fund. It would be inconsistent for the ESF to determine wages; that is something that the two sides of industry are quite capable of doing, and should be left to them.", "lang": "DE", "original": "Elisabeth Schroedter, im Namen der Verts/ALE-Fraktion . \u2013 Herr Pr\u00e4sident, sehr geehrte Kommissare, liebe Kolleginnen und Kollegen! Kommissar Verheugen sprach davon, dass die besch\u00e4ftigungspolitischen Leitlinien zum Herzst\u00fcck der Lissabon-Strategie geh\u00f6ren. Das stimmt. Inzwischen stellen die besch\u00e4ftigungspolitischen Leitlinien nicht nur formal die Grundlage der nationalen Besch\u00e4ftigungspl\u00e4ne dar, sondern entfalten ihre Wirkung in der Ausgestaltung und F\u00f6rderung des nationalen Arbeitsmarktes. Da ist es nicht egal, dass der Rat die vierte S\u00e4ule der europ\u00e4ischen Besch\u00e4ftigungspolitik, die F\u00f6rderung der Chancengleichheit f\u00fcr Frauen auf dem Arbeitsmarkt, einfach einkassiert. Frauen sind von Arbeitslosigkeit viel st\u00e4rker betroffen als M\u00e4nner. Sie sind es immer noch, die die meisten Teilzeitjobs haben. Sie bekommen immer noch 15\u00a0% weniger Lohn als M\u00e4nner f\u00fcr vergleichbare Arbeit. Ihre Aufstiegschancen sind geringer. Sie haben es immer noch wesentlich schwerer, wieder in den Arbeitsmarkt integriert zu werden, besonders dort, wo es keine fl\u00e4chendeckende, frei zug\u00e4ngliche Kinderbetreuung f\u00fcr den ganzen Tag gibt.\nEs bleibt weiter notwendig, gender mainstreaming mit aktiven Frauenf\u00f6rderungsma\u00dfnahmen zu flankieren. Insofern bin ich Magda K\u00f3s\u00e1n\u00e9 Kov\u00e1cs wirklich dankbar, dass wir wenigstens in den Erw\u00e4gungen einen gemeinsamen Kompromiss finden konnten, um messbare Indikatoren f\u00fcr die F\u00f6rderung der Chancengleichheit in die Leitlinien einzubringen.\nIch m\u00f6chte Sie auch noch auf einen zweiten \u00c4nderungsantrag aufmerksam machen. Wir wollen die Leitlinie Nr. 22 streichen. Wir sind der Meinung, dass Lohnkostengestaltung allein Sache der Tarifpartner ist und nicht Bestandteil politischer Beschl\u00fcsse sein darf. Es ist f\u00fcr mich sehr befremdlich, feststellen zu m\u00fcssen, dass hier scheinbar eine stille \u00dcbereinkunft zwischen den beiden gro\u00dfen Fraktionen im Parlament besteht, dass in Zukunft politische Regierungsbeschl\u00fcsse in Form von nationalen Besch\u00e4ftigungspl\u00e4nen daf\u00fcr zu sorgen haben, dass die allgemeine Lohnentwicklung mit dem Produktivit\u00e4tszuwachs im Konjunkturzyklus in Einklang zu bringen ist. Ich dachte, wir h\u00e4tten die Planwirtschaft, die ich aus der DDR kenne, in Europa endlich \u00fcberwunden, zumal daran gedacht werden muss, dass die Leitlinien die Vorgaben f\u00fcr das F\u00f6rderkonzept des Europ\u00e4ischen Sozialfonds sind. Es w\u00e4re inkonsequent, wenn der ESF Lohngestaltung betreiben sollte.

The notion that the interests of a particular country can be protected by restricting freedom of movement within the EU is pie in the sky. This kind of attitude may work as a short term panacea but will never properly solve the challenges facing the EU.\nIn order for Europe to gain a firmer foothold in an increasingly globalised world, it needs, first and foremost, to press ahead with liberalising the markets. As we know, the demographic situation on the European continent and the phenomenon of globalisation make it imperative that we carry out a range of reforms to the social and economic models of many EU Member States. The higher the economic growth in Europe, the easier it will be to carry out these reforms, but in order for that growth to emerge, the internal market must be functioning completely. While Europe grows at rates of 1, 2 or even 3%, it is very difficult to implement these reforms, which are so vital for peace and social stability in the EU.\nI therefore wish to highlight the fact that the completion of the internal market of course contains an economic component, but there is a further crucial element, and that is social policy. This is yet another reason why I support the Commission\u2019s efforts thus far in this area.\nI should like to make one final remark about the free movement of workers.

We in Parliament have, of course, come out in favour of the Guidelines being long-term three-year cycles and of their being integrated. Once suitably long-term, integrated Guidelines are in place, it is incredibly important for us to examine the National Reform Programmes. It is important for the Commission to do this, but it is also important for Parliament to be involved in examining and following up the National Reform Programmes.\nCommissioner Almunia said that the economic prospects are better now. That is true, but the employment situation in Europe is anything but encouraging. It is entirely possible that it can be improved, but allow me to discuss three areas that are extremely worrying.\nFirstly, there is the question of youth unemployment. This is of very great concern because, if young people leave education only to be immediately unemployed \u2013 and in the long term, at that \u2013 it is incredibly difficult to get them back into the labour market subsequently. I do not believe in the French model or believe, as a number of other parties expressly do, that employment is boosted by making one particular group or another less secure. Employment is stimulated through proactive industrial and labour market policies.\nWhere the older labour force is concerned, we have the dilemma that people are leaving the EU labour market far too early nowadays. Older workers need to be able to develop their skills to a higher degree, but we also need to increase health and safety in workplaces.\nI turn, finally, to gender equality, which must permeate everything. I welcome the Gender Equality Pact which is now, or will in time be, part of the Lisbon process.

N\u00e4r man har denna l\u00e5ngsiktighet och denna integration s\u00e5 \u00e4r det oerh\u00f6rt viktigt att vi granskar de nationella reformplanerna. Det \u00e4r viktigt att kommissionen g\u00f6r det, men det \u00e4r ocks\u00e5 viktigt att parlamentet blir involverad i granskningen och uppf\u00f6ljningen av de nationella reformplanerna.\nKommission\u00e4r Almunia sa att de ekonomiska utsikterna \u00e4r b\u00e4ttre nu. Det \u00e4r sant, men syssels\u00e4ttningssituationen i Europa \u00e4r allt annat \u00e4n ljus. Det \u00e4r mycket m\u00f6jligt att den kan f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttras, men l\u00e5t mig ta tre omr\u00e5den som \u00e4r ytterst besv\u00e4rliga.\nF\u00f6r det f\u00f6rsta g\u00e4ller det ungdomsarbetsl\u00f6sheten. Ungdomsarbetsl\u00f6sheten \u00e4r oerh\u00f6rt viktig, f\u00f6r om ungdomar g\u00e5r direkt fr\u00e5n utbildning till arbetsl\u00f6shet och l\u00e5ngtidsarbetsl\u00f6shet s\u00e5 \u00e4r det oerh\u00f6rt sv\u00e5rt att f\u00e5 dem tillbaka in p\u00e5 arbetsmarknaden senare. Jag tror inte p\u00e5 den franska modellen eller, som en del andra partier s\u00e4ger, att man genom att f\u00f6rs\u00e4mra tryggheten f\u00f6r den gruppen eller f\u00f6r n\u00e5gon annan speciell grupp stimulerar syssels\u00e4ttningen. Styrsyssels\u00e4ttningen stimuleras genom en aktiv n\u00e4ringspolitik och en aktiv arbetsmarknadspolitik.\nN\u00e4r det g\u00e4ller den \u00e4ldre arbetskraften s\u00e5 har vi dilemmat att man l\u00e4mnar arbetsmarknaden alldeles f\u00f6r tidigt inom EU idag. Det beh\u00f6vs mer kompetensutveckling f\u00f6r den \u00e4ldre arbetskraften, men samtidigt ocks\u00e5 att vi st\u00e4rker h\u00e4lsan och s\u00e4kerheten p\u00e5 arbetsplatserna.\nTill slut j\u00e4mst\u00e4lldheten. J\u00e4mst\u00e4lldheten m\u00e5ste genomsyra allt. Jag v\u00e4lkomnar den j\u00e4mst\u00e4lldhetspakt som nu \u00e4r, eller kommer att bli, en del av Lissabonprocessen. Speciellt viktigt \u00e4r det att barnomsorg och annat byggs ut s\u00e5 att det blir m\u00f6jligt f\u00f6r m\u00e4n och kvinnor att tillsammans b\u00e5de arbeta och ha ett fungerande familjeliv.

At the European level, we call for the creation of a single tax base for the taxation of businesses, improvements in the VAT systems, for the adoption of the 14th companies directive, which will make it easier for companies to put themselves on an international footing; for further reductions in subsidies, the introduction of a Community patent and the consistent opening-up of the markets.

Equality of opportunity between men and women on the labour market is unquestionably an important issue.

First of all I would like to thank the rapporteur for having drawn attention in the report to restrictions on the free movement of labour within the European Union internal market.\nUnfortunately, the most recent enlargement of the European Union was perceived within the internal market as a threat, instead of a new opportunity. The mythical Polish plumber, who in real life would be welcome, but is difficult to find, clearly illustrates the fears which after enlargement now hold sway in the European Union internal market. We see a negative attitude towards all four market freedoms, and not just the free movement of labour.\nIt is therefore a pity that the report provides no assessment of the draft Services Directive as watered down by this Parliament, which in the variant put forward by the Commission was supposed in the coming years to become the main stimulus for the labour market in the European Union.\nSimilarly, the report did not assess the negative repercussions for employment of restrictions on the free movement of capital. These include those restrictions adopted by this Parliament at last month\u2019s part-session in Strasbourg. I am referring to the report entitled \u2018Restructuring and employment\u2019 and particularly the report entitled \u2018Relocation in the context of regional development\u2019. The main leitmotiv of both reports is the creation of restrictions preventing businesses from freely relocating within the European Union internal market.\nThis is a time of untapped opportunities for boosting the European Union labour market. The development and strengthening of the European Union\u2019s internal market is the most effective tool in preparing the Member States\u2019 labour market for increasing global competition. Therefore, we ought to look at the basic approach of the Member States\u2019 employment policies in close connection with the goal of developing the potential of the European Union internal market.", "lang": "LV", "original": "Guntars Krasts (UEN). \u2013 Paldies priek\u0161s\u0113d\u0113t\u0101jam!

For women, motherhood represents an enormous challenge in their working lives. Flexibility also makes it possible for the youngest and oldest workers to join the labour force and obtain employment, which is currently a major problem. Not everyone in Europe is in favour of such flexibility, as is obvious from events taking place on the streets of Paris. The only action we can therefore take at European level is to scale down harmonisation in this area, so as to achieve flexibility in at least some countries and areas of the European Union.\nIf we were asked to identify a key word relating to economic policy it would have to be competition along with tax competition. Contrary to statements in the report, competition is not detrimental to the financing of public needs. The opposite is actually the case, as increased receipts have been recorded by the national budgets of countries that recently radically reformed their tax systems, notably by reducing corporate taxes. Tax competition in countries such as Ireland or Slovakia also contributes to increasing the competitiveness of Europe as a whole, thus improving our competitiveness at global level.\nConsequently, tax competition does not threaten Europe in any way.

As the report frequently reiterates, one of the serious problems facing the European Union at present is the fact that most Member States underestimate the need for far-reaching structural reform. Paradoxically, some Member States have tried to address the loss of competitiveness that is a natural consequence of rejecting such reform by implementing new measures to protect their markets, which only makes the problem worse. We must again concede that the internal market is not fully functional and does not enable the free movement of labour or the free provision of services. The consequences of this approach are markedly negative. Companies have been relocating their operations to areas with cheaper labour or, alternatively, have been outsourcing them, which has also caused job contraction.\nIn macroeconomic terms, one major result of such a policy is slow growth and, given the unchanged structure of public finances, a deteriorating general government deficit, frequently exceeding the limits imposed under the Stability and Growth Pact. If we take into consideration the low volumes of investment in research, technological development and innovation, and if we add the high energy dependence of most Member States, we can hardly expect a significant increase in the competitiveness of the European economy vis-\u00e0-vis major global players such as the USA and China. We must respond quickly to these challenges by putting in place a fully functional internal market, operating without any discrimination and unhampered by unnecessary regulation.\nThe harmonisation of European legislation must advance rather than hinder the competitive environment. Efforts to harmonise corporate income tax provide unfortunate examples of such hindrance. In order to increase the internal competitiveness of Member States, and hence of the entire EU, the subsidiarity principle must become a\u00a0significant component of all Commission initiatives. In this respect, I also welcome the action programme on state aid reform that puts conditions in place for more investment into research, technological development and innovation, aiming to benefit small and medium-sized enterprises. By the same token, we should praise the Green Paper on a European strategy for a sustainable, competitive and secure energy supply.", "lang": "SK", "original": "J\u00e1n Hudack\u00fd (PPE-DE). \u2013 \u00davodom mi dovo\u013ete pogratulova\u0165 spravodajcovi p\u00e1novi Garc\u00edovi-Margallovi k\u00a0jeho ve\u013emi v\u00fdsti\u017enej a\u00a0vyv\u00e1\u017eenej spr\u00e1ve.

Secondly, countering relocation which is an objective economic process involving an effort to reduce manufacturing costs and thus improve the competitiveness of businesses in the global economy. Thirdly, introducing additional regulations concerning economic and social processes when what is actually required is a drastic reduction of such measures. Lastly, despite the positive experiences of countries such as Great Britain and Ireland following the opening up of their labour markets, the labour markets in the largest countries of the European Union remain closed to workers from the new Member States.\nThis is in fact one of the reasons why the European Union is developing much more slowly than the United States, and why the old Member States of the Union are developing more slowly than the new ones.", "lang": "PL", "original": "Zbigniew Krzysztof Ku\u017amiuk (UEN). \u2013 Panie Przewodnicz\u0105cy!

The first of these is that it is those European economies that are most open to globalisation that now have the best economic development. The second is that it is those countries that have the most flexible labour markets that also have the best development in terms of new jobs. It is in the light of this that I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr\u00a0Garc\u00eda-Margallo\u00a0y\u00a0Marfil, for the work he has done, because it is the changes and policy direction proposed in his report that constitute the approach that can provide more jobs and greater prosperity.\nThe crucial question is that of whether all this will lead to changes and of whether policy will be changed at European and Member State level. A Swedish politician once said that \u2018if things are allowed to go on operating as they have done in the past, things will proceed unchanged\u2019. We now have more than 20\u00a0million unemployed. That is an economic issue, but it is also to the very highest degree a social issue. There is no issue more important for social protection than the growth of new jobs. In this area, the Commission has a number of tasks with which it must get to grips.\nFirstly, it must implement those directives that open the way to greater competition. Secondly, it must take action to open the door to more enterprise, and that brings the whole of competition policy into focus. New enterprise does not only mean the growth of small companies. It also means the ability to establish new cross-border companies in Europe that can be \u2018global champions\u2019. The Commission must assume responsibility for doing these things, but the Member States also have a responsibility to implement those reforms that will give rise to new enterprise. Finally, we must ensure that we obtain more flexible labour markets in Europe. If we do not do so, we shall be excluding millions of people from the labour market and from social protection. Those who are in favour of social protection and economic development are also in favour of more flexible labour markets.

Europe\u2019s economies are developing slowly, we have high unemployment and our public finances are in crisis. The situation has remained unchanged for a number of years and may result in Europe losing its leading role in the world. Major structural reform is needed, together with a change of economic policy.\nThe broad economic policy guidelines put forward by the Commission correctly identify the essential action required. This includes creating more flexible labour markets and a business-friendly environment, in addition to supporting education, training and research. The Commission has been advocating all this for years, however, to no great avail. I would remind the House that the reasons for the weakness of European economies are well known. So too is the nature of the action required to stimulate economic growth and create new jobs. Unfortunately, politicians in the Member States are reluctant to take the necessary measures for fear of losing popularity or because of short-sighted political calculations or even sheer ignorance at times. Europe is actually suffering from a crisis of political leadership.\nToday\u2019s debate ought to be directed principally towards the governments of Member States and the political circles supporting them. It should aim to send out alarm signals to the effect that if essential reforms are not undertaken, Europe is likely to stagnate and fall behind. The economic and social progress it has achieved will also be threatened. A politician\u2019s brief is actually to resolve specific problems, not to be subservient to popularity polls and the voters\u2019 whims.

Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start with warm thanks to the rapporteur for the hard work he has put in on this topic. The report spells out once more the fact that the European Union presents the people of Europe, in the face of globalisation, with an opportunity to find a fair compromise between economic conditions on the one hand and social conditions on the other. The problem is, though, that this has completely passed the people of Europe by. The 20 million unemployed and the hundreds of millions of people who fear for their jobs attribute their circumstances more to the European Union than to globalisation. The others, whose jobs are kept safe by the European Union and by the work of the Commission and of this House, are completely unaware of that fact and attribute it to the national governments.\nI want to say how much I am in agreement with Mr\u00a0Rosati: It would indeed be much to be desired, when considering these important issues, for the Council, which alone is competent to act on many of these issues in the context of the Lisbon Strategy, to apply itself with greater earnestness to this matter and if the debates in this House were not to be in the hands only of its own Members and the Members of the Commission, and, while it is indeed the case that the Commission does have an important function to perform in ensuring that the measures already adopted at Council level are actually implemented by the Member States, we must nevertheless be honest, for \u2013 as we shall probably see later on when considering the \u0150ry report \u2013 what matters at the end of the day is that the Member States should keep to what they themselves once decided.\nThat is why it is very good that the Commission has indicated \u2013 indeed, Commissioner \u0160pidla has been saying so to the German media \u2013 that bringing greater flexibility to the labour markets is the only way we in Europe can provide our people with more work, and that this, being a means whereby work is created, must not be a source of anxiety. That, in fact, is what we all want.\nI therefore strongly encourage you to spell it out to the Member States with greater emphasis that the decisions taken by the Council need, at last, to be put into effect.", "lang": "DE", "original": "Andreas Schwab (PPE-DE). \u2013 Herr Pr\u00e4sident! Ich freue mich nat\u00fcrlich, dass ich doch ann\u00e4hernd in dem Zeitraum sprechen darf, der mir urspr\u00fcnglich zugewiesen wurde. Sehr geehrte Kommissare, meine lieben Kollegen! Zun\u00e4chst m\u00f6chte ich auch dem Berichterstatter herzlich f\u00fcr seine intensive Arbeit zu diesem Thema danken. Der Bericht stellt nochmals eindeutig klar, dass die Europ\u00e4ische Union die Chance f\u00fcr die B\u00fcrgerinnen und B\u00fcrger in Europa ist, innerhalb der Globalisierung einen fairen Kompromiss zwischen den wirtschaftlichen Rahmenbedingungen einerseits und den sozialen Rahmenbedingungen andererseits zu erreichen. Aber das Problem ist, dass die B\u00fcrgerinnen und B\u00fcrger in Europa davon nichts mitbekommen. Die 20 Millionen, die arbeitslos sind, und die ca. 100 Millionen Menschen, die Angst um ihren Arbeitsplatz haben, schieben dies auf die Europ\u00e4ische Union und weniger auf die Globalisierung. Die anderen, deren Arbeitspl\u00e4tze durch die Europ\u00e4ische Union und die Arbeit der Kommission und des Parlaments gesichert wurden, wissen davon nichts und schreiben es den nationalen Regierungen zu.\nIch m\u00f6chte dem Kollegen Rosati ausdr\u00fccklich beipflichten: Es w\u00e4re durchaus w\u00fcnschenswert, wenn bei diesen wichtigen Themen der Rat, der in diesem Bereich innerhalb der Lissabon-Strategie in vielen Fragen allein zust\u00e4ndig ist, sich dieses Themas ernsthafter annehmen w\u00fcrde und die Debatten im Europ\u00e4ischen Parlament nicht zwischen Kommission und Parlament alleine gef\u00fchrt w\u00fcrden. Es stimmt zwar, dass auch die Kommission eine wichtige Aufgabe wahrzunehmen hat, dass die Ma\u00dfnahmen, die bereits im Rat beschlossen wurden, von den Mitgliedstaaten de facto auch umgesetzt werden. Aber wir m\u00fcssen auch ehrlich sein \u2013 wir werden das wahrscheinlich sp\u00e4ter beim Bericht \u0150ry sehen \u2013: Letztlich kommt es darauf an, dass die Mitgliedstaaten sich an das halten, was sie einmal selbst beschlossen haben.\nDeswegen ist es sehr gut, dass die Kommission \u2013 Herr \u0160pidla hat sich auch in den deutschen Medien dazu ge\u00e4u\u00dfert \u2013 darauf hinweist, dass die Flexibilisierung der Arbeitsm\u00e4rkte das Einzige ist, was wir in Europa daf\u00fcr tun k\u00f6nnen, um unseren B\u00fcrgerinnen und B\u00fcrgern mehr Arbeit zu geben, und dass das keine Angst mit sich bringen muss, sondern dass dadurch im Gegenteil mehr Arbeit geschaffen wird. Das ist eigentlich das, was alle wollen.\nDeshalb ermuntere ich Sie ausdr\u00fccklich, auch in den Mitgliedstaaten st\u00e4rker darauf hinzuweisen, dass die Beschl\u00fcsse, die der Rat in dieser Beziehung gefasst hat, endlich umgesetzt werden.", "agenda_item": "Guidelines for Member States\u2019 employment policies \u2013 Broad economic policy guidelines for 2006 (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060404-ITEM-006", "intervention_id": "2-053", "summary_english": "{\n\"headline\": \"EU Must Better Communicate Its Economic Benefits While Council Should Implement Lisbon Strategy Decisions More Effectively\",\n\"issueSum\": \"The speaker identifies a communication problem where Europeans don't understand the EU's protective role against globalization, with 20 million unemployed and hundreds of millions fearing job loss blaming the EU rather than globalization.

All that remains is for those recommendations to be heeded.\nAs things stand, we should be speaking of deepening, rather than reviewing, the Lisbon Strategy, given that what we are now seeing \u2013 and have been since the outset \u2013 is increased economic growth and more jobs, both of which help to sustain the social models in the long term, and foster adequate social cohesion in the short term.\nIn spite of recent progress, the key issues remain untouched. Unemployment is at an intolerable level and overall economic growth is insufficient to reverse this trend. Consequently, greater integration and better coordination of economic policies is required, and the work of the institutions forming the emerging economic government of the Union must be developed.\nThe Council decided to support the Commission in drawing up a common European energy policy. Although this was an interesting decision, it still falls short of what is required. The Union\u2019s energy dependency is unsustainable. Oil imports currently account for 2.3% of Union GDP, which is two and a half times the budget earmarked for all European policies. By 2030, that dependency may prove overwhelming, especially in the oil sector (94% of foreign dependency). The simple agreements between Member States promoted by the Council are therefore inadequate.\nIncreased competition is a necessary prerequisite to the creation of a common energy policy. A common regulation will, above all, require huge investment if existing networks are to be improved and if genuine progress is to be made once again in the area of alternative energy and energy saving.

Debate Information\n\nThis parliamentary debate focused on the EU's integrated economic guidelines for 2006, combining employment policies with broad economic policy guidelines as part of the revised Lisbon Strategy. The debate featured 40 contributions from Commission officials, MEPs across various political groups, and covered themes including employment creation, economic competitiveness, structural reforms, and the coordination between national and European policies. The discussion took place during a critical period when Europe faced high unemployment (around 20 million unemployed) and needed to address globalization challenges.\n\n## 2. Executive Summary\n\n### Commission Position and Framework\n\nCommission Vice-President G\u00fcnther Verheugen outlined the integrated approach, stating that \"at the heart of the new growth and employment policy with which we seek to move the Lisbon agenda forward, are the integrated economic guidelines; they are integrated because they reflect the recognition that we cannot satisfactorily perform the task of bringing Europe more growth and more jobs if we fail to make the close connection between macro-economic, micro-economic and employment goals.\" The Commission maintained a three-year cycle for guidelines stability while reserving the right to introduce country-specific recommendations.\n\nCommissioner Joaqu\u00edn Almunia praised Parliament's support and highlighted progress in synchronizing the Lisbon Strategy with the Stability and Growth Pact, noting that \"the European economy is making better progress today towards fiscal consolidation than it was a year ago, as one of the necessary conditions for more solid growth and growth that is capable of generating employment.\"\n\nCommissioner Vladim\u00edr \u0160pidla focused on employment guidelines, emphasizing that \"the Union would be capable of creating 2 million jobs per year. Yet job creation and cuts in unemployment will not happen unless we take advantage of the current economic growth to continue with the necessary reforms.\"\n\n### Parliamentary Positions and Debates\n\n**Support for Integrated Approach**: Rapporteur Magda K\u00f3s\u00e1n\u00e9 Kov\u00e1cs (PSE) supported the integrated guidelines but emphasized that \"work that is not accompanied by and founded on social security cannot produce significant economic results.\" She called for better labor market inclusion of women, aging workers, and young people.\n\n**Calls for Structural Reform**: Jos\u00e9 Manuel Garc\u00eda-Margallo y Marfil (PPE-DE) demanded action on ignored recommendations, warning that \"this Parliament will not approve any directive by means of the Lamfalussy procedure if the problem of call-back is not resolved by 2008.\" He advocated for institutional reforms including tax coordination.\n\n**Market Liberalization Debate**: Several speakers divided on market liberalization. Jos\u00e9 Albino Silva Peneda (PPE-DE) argued that \"every obstacle to the freedom of movement of persons, goods, capital and services is a major obstacle to competitiveness, growth and job creation,\" while Elisabeth Schroedter opposed certain aspects, particularly government wage controls that resembled \"the planned economy with which we were familiar in the former East Germany.\"\n\n**Tax Policy Controversies**: Significant disagreement emerged on tax harmonization. Eoin Ryan strongly opposed common tax policies, stating \"I absolutely reject all sections of this report that call for support for the Commission's common consolidated corporate tax base,\" while others like Udo Bullmann called for \"a common fiscal policy for this European Union of ours.\"\n\n**Employment Flexibility vs. Security**: The debate revealed tensions between flexibility and security. Konrad Szyma\u0144ski (UEN) argued that \"if we were asked to identify a key word relating to European employment policy, it would have to be flexibility,\" while Jan Andersson (PSE) opposed \"making one particular group or another less secure\" as a solution to unemployment.\n\n### Key Policy Proposals\n\n**Investment and Innovation**: Multiple speakers called for increased R&D investment. Udo Bullmann proposed \"a common investment policy\" and coordinated investment in research, education, and energy efficiency. G\u00e1bor Harangoz\u00f3 (PSE) emphasized the need to \"support for R&D, encouragement of private and public investments, development of innovative actions for biotechnologies, sustainable energies and ICTs.\"\n\n**Gender Equality and Vulnerable Groups**: Ana Mato Adrover advocated for \"genuine equality of opportunities including women's incorporation, permanent positions, promotion and equal pay,\" while Ji\u0159\u00ed Ma\u0161t\u00e1lka called for scrupulous application of anti-discrimination laws.\n\n**Energy Policy**: Manuel Ant\u00f3nio dos Santos highlighted that \"oil imports currently account for 2.3% of Union GDP, which is two and a half times the budget earmarked for all European policies,\" calling for comprehensive European energy policy.\n\n**Internal Market Completion**: Othmar Karas (PPE-DE) demanded \"codecision for this European Parliament in all matters touching upon the single market\" and full implementation of internal market directives.\n\n### Critical Perspectives\n\nSeveral speakers expressed skepticism about EU policies. Derek Roland Clark warned that \"your tax systems are under threat\" through EU interference, while Ilda Figueiredo criticized the guidelines as serving \"large economic and financial groups\" rather than workers. Georgios Karatzaferis painted a dire picture, stating \"we need 40 million jobs in Europe\" and questioned whether such promises could be delivered.\n\n### Consensus Areas\n\nDespite disagreements, broad consensus emerged on several issues: the need to address high unemployment, the importance of the Lisbon Strategy, the necessity of structural reforms, and the goal of creating quality jobs. Most speakers agreed on the integrated approach to economic and employment guidelines, though they differed on implementation methods.\n\nThe debate reflected fundamental tensions between market-oriented and social protection approaches, national sovereignty versus European integration, and short-term political considerations versus long-term structural reform needs. The discussion highlighted the complexity of coordinating economic policy across diverse EU member states while maintaining democratic accountability and social cohesion.", "src_model": "claude", "model_type": "claude", "model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "structured": true, "incremental": false, "hierarchical": false, "grouped": false, "shuffle": false, "prompt": false, "lang": "english"}
