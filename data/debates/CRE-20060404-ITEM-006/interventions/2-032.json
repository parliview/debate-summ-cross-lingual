Well, let us do that. The French took a 35-hour working week, not a 48-hour week. But when the Working Time Directive was given flesh last year, many of their workers protested at EU interference.\nPort workers protested earlier this year at more EU interference. French cities are now under siege due to new youth employment policies. Who is going to tell Mr\u00a0Chirac or Mr de Villepin that they are wrong, they are not conforming to guidelines? Of course you will not. The French will govern themselves, as all of us should do, as grown-up democracies. But most sinister of all in this report is Guideline 19: continual review of incentives and disincentives resulting from the tax and benefits systems. Already a colleague has spoken this morning of a single fiscal policy. Is this the start of EU harmonisation of tax policy across the Union \u2013 something they said would never happen?
