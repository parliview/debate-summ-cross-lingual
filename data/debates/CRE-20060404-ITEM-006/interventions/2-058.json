The European economy suffers from a lower demographic growth, employment rate and productivity. Europe must foresee long-term strategies and sufficient resources to invest in its future. The strategies were designed in order to address these problems but the situation is getting worse. There are various reasons for this situation: a lack of appropriate infrastructure, insufficient private and public investments, delays in the development of innovative technologies and inappropriate vocational training and education.\nEurope needs a clear vision for a more competitive economy. To be in line with the employment and growth objectives of the Lisbon Strategy, structural changes are required: support for R&D, encouragement of private and public investments, development of innovative actions for sectors such as biotechnologies, sustainable energies and ICTs. Besides the structural changes and the development of innovative sectors, environmental protection and the quality of products must remain, within the framework of global economy, a genuine European specificity. Finally, it is paramount to foster related education and vocational training in order to meet the requirements and challenges of economic development.", "lang": "EN", "original": "G\u00e1bor Harangoz\u00f3 (PSE). \u2013 In recent years the EU has been facing serious economic problems: the Union\u2019s growth is below its potential when compared to the US or to emerging countries such as China or India.
