It appears, however, that the report fails to focus appropriately on the most difficult area of the economy, the one that consumes most Union resources, requires protection and is inadequately exploited in economic terms. I refer to the agricultural sector in its broadest sense.\nThe most substantial payments benefit magnates, whilst small farms are going out of business and the amount of uncultivated land is increasing along with the number of people who have lost their jobs and all hope for the future. The enormous potential of the sector remains unexploited, although sound policies could enable it to make a positive contribution to the development of the wider economy.\nThe programme of activities aimed at developing industrial crops is not ambitious enough, and the research and implementation programme fails to provide the necessary backing for swift progress. We are lagging behind countries whose economies are efficient in this regard. The issue merits broad debate and calls for swift and effective action to be taken in the course of 2006.", "lang": "PL", "original": "Leopold J\u00f3zef Rutowicz (NI). \u2013 Panie Przewodnicz\u0105cy!
