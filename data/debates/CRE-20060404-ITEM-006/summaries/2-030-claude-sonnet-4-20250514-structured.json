{"speaker": "Ilda Figueiredo,", "english": "Ilda Figueiredo, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group . \u2013 (PT) The bulk of the integrated guidelines for employment growth contain the main barriers to an effective employment policy that prioritises the creation of high-quality jobs with rights, social and territorial cohesion, and people\u2019s well-being.\nThis is, first of all, because priority is attached to ensuring economic stability, to enlarging and deepening the internal market, to opening up the markets and promoting competition, and to creating a more business-friendly environment. All of which is music to the ears of the large economic and financial groups, and to the overlords of international trade who, enjoying the fruits of exploiting cheap labour from third countries, prefer the enormous returns from relocating production to maintaining and developing jobs with rights in EU Member States.\nWhat is more, the guidelines for employment are much too vague, as they omit key areas, such as the need to increase female involvement in the labour market, and to ensure high-quality jobs with rights. This would help to combat the kind of salary- and career-related discrimination that women continue to fall victim to, and would not lead to the precarious, poorly-paid work that we see today.\nIt is also crucial to boost regional economies, to promote micro, small and medium-sized enterprises and to create jobs in regions where there are high levels of unemployment.\nFamilies must also be supported, both in terms of rearranging and reducing working hours, without any loss of rights, and in terms of investing in public services to support the family, as this would help to create jobs better suited to local and regional needs. Greater public investment is therefore urgently required in health, housing and guaranteed access to free, high-quality education and training. We have therefore tabled a proposal to attach these guidelines to the proposals submitted, as we believe it is vital to include them in the guidelines for employment.", "lang": "PT", "original": "Ilda Figueiredo, em nome do Grupo GUE/NGL . \u2013 As orienta\u00e7\u00f5es integradas para o crescimento do emprego cont\u00eam no seu bojo os principais entraves a uma pol\u00edtica de emprego eficaz, que d\u00ea prioridade \u00e0 cria\u00e7\u00e3o de emprego de qualidade, a empregos com direitos, \u00e0 coes\u00e3o social e territorial, bem como ao bem-estar das pessoas.\nDesde logo, porque a prioridade \u00e9 dada \u00e0 garantia de estabilidade econ\u00f3mica, ao alargamento e aprofundamento do mercado interno, \u00e0 garantia da abertura e da competitividade dos mercados, \u00e0 cria\u00e7\u00e3o de um ambiente empresarial mais atractivo, ou seja, tudo m\u00fasica celestial para os grupos econ\u00f3micos e financeiros, para os senhores do com\u00e9rcio internacional que, beneficiando da explora\u00e7\u00e3o de m\u00e3o-de-obra barata em pa\u00edses terceiros, preferem a aposta nos enormes ganhos resultantes das deslocaliza\u00e7\u00f5es da produ\u00e7\u00e3o do que manter e desenvolver empregos com direitos nos pa\u00edses da Uni\u00e3o Europeia.\nAcresce que as orienta\u00e7\u00f5es propriamente ditas para o emprego s\u00e3o demasiado vagas e esquecem \u00e1reas fundamentais, designadamente a necessidade de aumentar a participa\u00e7\u00e3o das mulheres no mercado de trabalho, garantindo-lhes empregos de qualidade e com direitos, e combatendo discrimina\u00e7\u00f5es a n\u00edvel salarial e de carreira, a que continuam sujeitas, e n\u00e3o criando um trabalho prec\u00e1rio e mal pago, como hoje acontece.\nDe igual modo imp\u00f5e-se que se promovam as economias regionais, as micro, as pequenas e m\u00e9dias empresas e a cria\u00e7\u00e3o de postos de trabalho nas regi\u00f5es com elevadas taxas de desemprego.\nTal como \u00e9 fundamental que se apoiem as fam\u00edlias, quer em termos de reorganiza\u00e7\u00e3o do hor\u00e1rio de trabalho e da sua redu\u00e7\u00e3o, sem perdas de direitos, quer ao n\u00edvel do investimento em servi\u00e7os p\u00fablicos de apoio \u00e0 fam\u00edlia, o que contribuiria igualmente para criar mais empregos adaptados \u00e0s necessidades locais e regionais.
