(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the debate has shown just how much distance we have covered together, but it has also shown that the new growth and employment strategy is increasingly understood and that there is increasing pressure to take seriously and to realise the priorities we have set. The Commission has listened very carefully, and we will pay very careful attention to what the groups and the speakers have told us, and will, in future debates, endeavour to take on board your House\u2019s wishes and suggestions.\nLet me conclude by reiterating, and very clearly, that the reason why growth and employment are priorities for the years ahead of us is that without more growth and the creation of more jobs, we will be unable to realise our great and far-reaching political goals. We will not be able to maintain a high environmental standard, we will not be able to maintain high social standards, and we will not be able to maintain a high standard of living if we do not have strong economic foundations that can bear their weight, and that is why we say that growth and jobs are our number one task.\nThe guidelines, which we have been discussing today, are among the essential means whereby we ensure that we in Europe are able, perhaps, to make a virtue of necessity. Our inability to have a common economic policy is of course a defect, but it can become a virtue if we can agree on a new kind of cooperation of the kind that we have developed in the shape of the Partnership for Growth and Jobs.", "lang": "EN", "original": "G\u00fcnther Verheugen, Vice-President of the Commission .
