{"speaker": "Dariusz Rosati (PSE). \u2013", "english": "Dariusz Rosati (PSE). \u2013 (PL) Mr President, today\u2019s debate concerns the future of the European Union. Europe\u2019s economies are developing slowly, we have high unemployment and our public finances are in crisis. The situation has remained unchanged for a number of years and may result in Europe losing its leading role in the world. Major structural reform is needed, together with a change of economic policy.\nThe broad economic policy guidelines put forward by the Commission correctly identify the essential action required. This includes creating more flexible labour markets and a business-friendly environment, in addition to supporting education, training and research. The Commission has been advocating all this for years, however, to no great avail. I would remind the House that the reasons for the weakness of European economies are well known. So too is the nature of the action required to stimulate economic growth and create new jobs. Unfortunately, politicians in the Member States are reluctant to take the necessary measures for fear of losing popularity or because of short-sighted political calculations or even sheer ignorance at times. Europe is actually suffering from a crisis of political leadership.\nToday\u2019s debate ought to be directed principally towards the governments of Member States and the political circles supporting them. It should aim to send out alarm signals to the effect that if essential reforms are not undertaken, Europe is likely to stagnate and fall behind. The economic and social progress it has achieved will also be threatened. A politician\u2019s brief is actually to resolve specific problems, not to be subservient to popularity polls and the voters\u2019 whims. We are relying on politicians in the Member States to undertake the relevant reforms and persuade their citizens that they are indeed necessary.\nI urge the Commission to take strong and decisive action in this regard.", "lang": "PL", "original": "Dariusz Rosati (PSE). \u2013 Panie Przewodnicz\u0105cy! Dzisiejsza debata dotyczy przysz\u0142o\u015bci Unii Europejskiej. Gospodarki europejskie rozwijaj\u0105 si\u0119 wolno, mamy wysokie bezrobocie, finanse publiczne s\u0105 w kryzysie. Sytuacja ta utrzymuje si\u0119 od lat i grozi utrat\u0105 przez Europ\u0119 jej wiod\u0105cej roli w \u015bwiecie. Potrzebne s\u0105 g\u0142\u0119bokie reformy strukturalne i zmiana polityki gospodarczej.\nPrzedstawione przez Komisj\u0119 zintegrowane wytyczne polityki gospodarczej prawid\u0142owo wskazuj\u0105 na konieczne kierunki dzia\u0142a\u0144. Elastyczne rynki pracy, przyjazne otoczenie dla biznes\u00f3w, wsparcie dla edukacji, kszta\u0142cenia, bada\u0144 naukowych, ale Komisja powtarza te postulaty od lat, bez wi\u0119kszego skutku. Przecie\u017c powszechnie wiadomo, jakie s\u0105 przyczyny s\u0142abo\u015bci europejskich gospodarek i jakie dzia\u0142ania trzeba podj\u0105\u0107, aby zapewni\u0107 wzrost gospodarczy i nowe miejsca pracy. Jednak obawa przed utrat\u0105 popularno\u015bci i kr\u00f3tkowzroczne kalkulacje polityczne, a czasami po prostu zwyk\u0142a ignorancja, powoduj\u0105, \u017ce politycy w pa\u0144stwach cz\u0142onkowskich powstrzymuj\u0105 si\u0119 przed podj\u0119ciem koniecznych dzia\u0142a\u0144. W efekcie mamy w Europie do czynienia z kryzysem przyw\u00f3dztwa politycznego.\nDzisiejsza debata powinna by\u0107 adresowana przede wszystkim do rz\u0105d\u00f3w pa\u0144stw cz\u0142onkowskich i ich politycznego zaplecza. G\u0142\u00f3wnym przes\u0142aniem powinien by\u0107 sygna\u0142 alarmowy, \u017ce bez niezb\u0119dnych reform Europie grozi stagnacja, zacofanie i utrata dotychczasowych osi\u0105gni\u0119\u0107 ekonomicznych i socjalnych. Zadaniem polityk\u00f3w jest bowiem rozwi\u0105zywanie konkretnych problem\u00f3w, a nie \u015bledzenie sonda\u017cy popularno\u015bci i schlebianie wyborcom. Oczekujemy od nich, w pa\u0144stwach cz\u0142onkowskich, \u017ce podejm\u0105 konieczne reformy i przekonaj\u0105 do nich swoich obywateli.\nApeluj\u0119 do Komisji o energiczne i stanowcze dzia\u0142ania w tej sprawie.", "agenda_item": "Guidelines for Member States\u2019 employment policies \u2013 Broad economic policy guidelines for 2006 (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060404-ITEM-006", "intervention_id": "2-052", "summary_english": "{\n  \"headline\": \"MEP Warns of European Economic Stagnation and Calls for Urgent Structural Reforms\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"The speaker highlights that Europe faces slow economic growth, high unemployment, and public finance crises that have persisted for years.
