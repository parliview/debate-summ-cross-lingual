{"speaker": "Jos\u00e9 Albino Silva Peneda (PPE-DE).", "english": "Jos\u00e9 Albino Silva Peneda (PPE-DE). \u2013 (PT) Mr President, at a time when the phenomenon of globalisation has ultimately determined many of the aspects of the economic and social systems of all our countries, we must be aware that every obstacle to the freedom of movement of persons, goods, capital and services is a major obstacle to competitiveness, growth and job creation. The notion that the interests of a particular country can be protected by restricting freedom of movement within the EU is pie in the sky. This kind of attitude may work as a short term panacea but will never properly solve the challenges facing the EU.\nIn order for Europe to gain a firmer foothold in an increasingly globalised world, it needs, first and foremost, to press ahead with liberalising the markets. As we know, the demographic situation on the European continent and the phenomenon of globalisation make it imperative that we carry out a range of reforms to the social and economic models of many EU Member States. The higher the economic growth in Europe, the easier it will be to carry out these reforms, but in order for that growth to emerge, the internal market must be functioning completely. While Europe grows at rates of 1, 2 or even 3%, it is very difficult to implement these reforms, which are so vital for peace and social stability in the EU.\nI therefore wish to highlight the fact that the completion of the internal market of course contains an economic component, but there is a further crucial element, and that is social policy. This is yet another reason why I support the Commission\u2019s efforts thus far in this area.\nI should like to make one final remark about the free movement of workers. By putting up certain types of barrier to the free movement of workers, some Member States are actually in the preposterous situation of helping workers from third countries to gain access to jobs ahead of those from new EU Member States.", "lang": "PT", "original": "Jos\u00e9 Albino Silva Peneda (PPE-DE). \u2013 Senhor Presidente, num tempo em que o fen\u00f3meno da globaliza\u00e7\u00e3o acaba por determinar muitos dos aspectos dos sistemas econ\u00f3micos e sociais de todos os nossos pa\u00edses, temos de ter consci\u00eancia de que cada obst\u00e1culo que limite a liberdade de circula\u00e7\u00e3o de pessoas, bens, capitais e servi\u00e7os \u00e9 um entrave s\u00e9rio \u00e0 competitividade, ao crescimento e \u00e0 cria\u00e7\u00e3o de emprego. \u00c9 pura ilus\u00e3o pensar que restringindo a liberdade de circula\u00e7\u00e3o dentro do espa\u00e7o da Uni\u00e3o Europeia se pode proteger interesses de um dado pa\u00eds.
