{"speaker": "Konrad Szyma\u0144ski (UEN). \u2013", "english": "Konrad Szyma\u0144ski (UEN). \u2013 (PL) Mr\u00a0President, if we were asked to identify a key word relating to European employment policy, it would have to be flexibility.\nEmployment law of this nature that is flexible regarding both the place of employment and the hours worked encourages women to be active in the labour market. For women, motherhood represents an enormous challenge in their working lives. Flexibility also makes it possible for the youngest and oldest workers to join the labour force and obtain employment, which is currently a major problem. Not everyone in Europe is in favour of such flexibility, as is obvious from events taking place on the streets of Paris. The only action we can therefore take at European level is to scale down harmonisation in this area, so as to achieve flexibility in at least some countries and areas of the European Union.\nIf we were asked to identify a key word relating to economic policy it would have to be competition along with tax competition. Contrary to statements in the report, competition is not detrimental to the financing of public needs. The opposite is actually the case, as increased receipts have been recorded by the national budgets of countries that recently radically reformed their tax systems, notably by reducing corporate taxes. Tax competition in countries such as Ireland or Slovakia also contributes to increasing the competitiveness of Europe as a whole, thus improving our competitiveness at global level.\nConsequently, tax competition does not threaten Europe in any way. It actually represents a tremendous opportunity. I fear, however, that it may be one of the few real opportunities open to us, if not the only one.", "lang": "PL", "original": "Konrad Szyma\u0144ski (UEN). \u2013 Panie Przewodnicz\u0105cy! Gdyby\u015bmy mieli szuka\u0107 s\u0142owa-klucza do europejskiej polityki zatrudnienia, tym s\u0142owem powinna by\u0107 \"elastyczno\u015b\u0107\".\nTo elastyczne prawo pracy, tak pod wzgl\u0119dem miejsca pracy, jak i czasu pracy aktywizuje kobiety, kt\u00f3re musz\u0105 stan\u0105\u0107 wobec najwi\u0119kszego wyzwania w swojej karierze zawodowej, jakim jest macierzy\u0144stwo. To elastyczno\u015b\u0107 u\u0142atwia wprowadzanie, zatrudnianie najm\u0142odszych i najstarszych uczestnik\u00f3w rynku pracy, z czym mamy tak wielkie problemy dzisiaj. Nie wszyscy w Europie na t\u0105 elastyczno\u015b\u0107 si\u0119 zgadzaj\u0105, widzimy to na paryskich ulicach. Zatem jedyne, co mo\u017cemy zrobi\u0107 na poziomie europejskim to zmniejszy\u0107 harmonizacj\u0119 w tej dziedzinie. Mniej harmonizacji, aby osi\u0105gn\u0105\u0107 elastyczno\u015b\u0107 w polityce zatrudnienia chocia\u017c w niekt\u00f3rych krajach, chocia\u017c w niekt\u00f3rych obszarach Unii Europejskiej.\nGdyby\u015bmy w polityce gospodarczej mieli szuka\u0107 takiego s\u0142owa-klucza to jest nim \"konkurencja\", a tak\u017ce \"konkurencja podatkowa\".

Konkurencja podatkowa kraj\u00f3w takich jak Irlandia czy S\u0142owacja jest zatem czynnikiem wzmacniaj\u0105cym konkurencyjno\u015b\u0107 Europy jako ca\u0142o\u015bci, wzmacniaj\u0105cym konkurencyjno\u015b\u0107 Europy w skali \u015bwiata.\nZatem konkurencja podatkowa nie jest zagro\u017ceniem dla Europy, ale jest olbrzymi\u0105 szans\u0105.
