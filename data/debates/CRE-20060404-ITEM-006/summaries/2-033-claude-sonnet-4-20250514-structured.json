We also have insufficient entrepreneurial dynamism, weak labour markets, sluggish productivity growth, lack of investment, lack of innovation and bad systems of education. Here we are calling for the entrepreneurial spirit to be encouraged, for a reduction in labour costs and for improved standards of teaching in mathematics and natural sciences. The description is very succinct, but very hypocritical. This Parliament could take concrete steps towards productivity, flexibility and encouraging the entrepreneurial spirit, and really \u2013 not just formally \u2013 liberalising the services market, instead of surrendering in a cowardly manner to the demonstrators in the nearby area.
