I shall comment on just a few of them.\nFirstly, countering tax competition and the suggestion of harmonising solutions concerning income tax payable by legal entities in a situation when reducing income tax rates has an obvious impact on the acceleration of economic growth. Secondly, countering relocation which is an objective economic process involving an effort to reduce manufacturing costs and thus improve the competitiveness of businesses in the global economy. Thirdly, introducing additional regulations concerning economic and social processes when what is actually required is a drastic reduction of such measures. Lastly, despite the positive experiences of countries such as Great Britain and Ireland following the opening up of their labour markets, the labour markets in the largest countries of the European Union remain closed to workers from the new Member States.\nThis is in fact one of the reasons why the European Union is developing much more slowly than the United States, and why the old Member States of the Union are developing more slowly than the new ones.", "lang": "PL", "original": "Zbigniew Krzysztof Ku\u017amiuk (UEN). \u2013 Panie Przewodnicz\u0105cy!
