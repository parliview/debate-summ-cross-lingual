{"speaker": "Sergej Kozl\u00edk (NI).", "english": "Sergej Kozl\u00edk (NI). \u2013 (SK) In my statement I\u00a0would like to take up several ideas from the resolution on the report into the energy sector, and I intend to do so in the context of the broader economic policy goals for 2006.\nThese ideas get to the heart of the issue without indulging in vain laments over the economic slowdown in Europe. Miracles simply do not happen, and therefore I\u00a0agree that an in-depth analysis of the structural reform policies of the past decade is necessary. This should clarify the causes of persistently slow growth rates and unsatisfactory productivity. Also important is the call for what is known as \u2018smart growth strategy\u2019. This strategy should consolidate the different approaches to EU economic policy into a consistent strategy.\nThe goal is to strengthen the European Union\u2019s potential with regard to a new generation of products and production methods by harnessing information and communication technologies. I also support the call for EU Member States to promote private investment. The shift of public and private capital expenditure towards investments that generally increase economic performance and productivity will also be important. However, it will be necessary to pursue and apply this approach also within the context of EU fund disbursements, as the saying applies that the areas most in need of attention are often those closest to home.", "lang": "SK", "original": "Sergej Kozl\u00edk (NI). \u2013 Vo svojom vyst\u00fapen\u00ed by som chcel vyzdvihn\u00fa\u0165 nieko\u013eko my\u0161lienok vypl\u00fdvaj\u00facich z\u00a0uznesenia ku spr\u00e1ve o\u00a0stave energetick\u00e9ho hospod\u00e1rstva v\u00a0kontexte \u0161ir\u0161\u00edch z\u00e1merov hospod\u00e1rskej politiky na rok 2006.\nSpomenut\u00e9 body bez zbyto\u010dn\u00e9ho n\u00e1reku nad spomalen\u00fdm ekonomick\u00fdm pohybom v\u00a0Eur\u00f3pe presne triafaj\u00fa do jadra probl\u00e9mu.
