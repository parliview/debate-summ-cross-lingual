The problem is that this combination of factors differs from country to country and must take into account peculiarities of the national economy. On the evidence of the unsuccessful experience of the International Monetary Fund in attempting to create a single universal model, it is doubtful whether we should try to create an economic strategy model on a European scale. I believe that we must stress three basic points. First of all, we ought to agree with Mr Garcia-Margallo's view that we must consolidate all economic policy documents; there are too many of them and they are repetitive. Secondly, we must outline a mechanism of interaction between national and European level economic strategies. And thirdly, this can be achieved by determining clear and concrete priorities which complement each other.", "lang": "LT", "original": "Margarita Starkevi\u010di\u016bt\u0117, ALDE frakcijos vardu . \u2013 Mokslininkai jau seniai nustat\u0117, kad n\u0117ra stebuklingo vaisto, kuris pad\u0117t\u0173 sukurti darbo vietas, i\u0161spr\u0119sti visas u\u017eimtumo problemas ir paskatinti konkurencingum\u0105, o yra daugyb\u0117 veiksni\u0173 ir tiesiog reikia surasti ger\u0105 j\u0173 derin\u012f.
