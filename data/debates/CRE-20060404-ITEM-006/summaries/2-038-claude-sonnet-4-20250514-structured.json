{"speaker": "Guntars Krasts (UEN). \u2013", "english": "Guntars Krasts (UEN). \u2013 (LV) Thank you, Mr\u00a0President. First of all I would like to thank the rapporteur for having drawn attention in the report to restrictions on the free movement of labour within the European Union internal market.\nUnfortunately, the most recent enlargement of the European Union was perceived within the internal market as a threat, instead of a new opportunity. The mythical Polish plumber, who in real life would be welcome, but is difficult to find, clearly illustrates the fears which after enlargement now hold sway in the European Union internal market. We see a negative attitude towards all four market freedoms, and not just the free movement of labour.\nIt is therefore a pity that the report provides no assessment of the draft Services Directive as watered down by this Parliament, which in the variant put forward by the Commission was supposed in the coming years to become the main stimulus for the labour market in the European Union.\nSimilarly, the report did not assess the negative repercussions for employment of restrictions on the free movement of capital. These include those restrictions adopted by this Parliament at last month\u2019s part-session in Strasbourg. I am referring to the report entitled \u2018Restructuring and employment\u2019 and particularly the report entitled \u2018Relocation in the context of regional development\u2019. The main leitmotiv of both reports is the creation of restrictions preventing businesses from freely relocating within the European Union internal market.\nThis is a time of untapped opportunities for boosting the European Union labour market. The development and strengthening of the European Union\u2019s internal market is the most effective tool in preparing the Member States\u2019 labour market for increasing global competition. Therefore, we ought to look at the basic approach of the Member States\u2019 employment policies in close connection with the goal of developing the potential of the European Union internal market.", "lang": "LV", "original": "Guntars Krasts (UEN). \u2013 Paldies priek\u0161s\u0113d\u0113t\u0101jam!
