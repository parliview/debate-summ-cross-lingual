The rapporteur has considered some fundamental issues relating to employment, which at the current time \u2013 a time of obsession over economic growth \u2013 are often overlooked, and these include the issues of equal opportunity for men and women, access to employment for young and old people, health and safety at work and freedom of movement for workers throughout the Union. On the basis of experience from the Czech Republic and conversations with colleagues, and also looking at the current situation in France, I know that the issue of first jobs for graduates, for example, is often one of the most challenging.\nDespite the fact that there have been efforts at a solution on the part of the European Commission, the recommendations and instruments of the European Commission have so far had little effect, due in part to patchy implementation by the Member States, as the rapporteur has stated. It is precisely this area that should be occupying most of our attention, together with age discrimination on the labour market. Equality of opportunity between men and women on the labour market is unquestionably an important issue. We know from the statistics that even though women constitute a growing segment of society, this trend is not reflected in their share of employment. What is more striking still is the proportion of women in leading positions. We must call on all Member States to apply anti-discrimination laws scrupulously and without delay, in order that this pattern may be reversed.", "lang": "CS", "original": "Ji\u0159\u00ed Ma\u0161t\u00e1lka (GUE/NGL). \u2013 Kolegov\u00e9 a kolegyn\u011b, v prv\u00e9 \u0159ad\u011b bych velice r\u00e1d vyj\u00e1d\u0159il up\u0159\u00edmn\u00e9 pod\u011bkov\u00e1n\u00ed pan\u00ed Kov\u00e1cs za p\u0159edlo\u017eenou zpr\u00e1vu.
