The Commission has technical analysis papers and supports France's solidarity contribution on air tickets as a positive example.\n\nSo, the key points from McCreevy are: the need for increased aid, but more aid alone isn't sufficient. He introduced the Commission's stance on innovative financing mechanisms needing to meet specific criteria. Also, he mentioned supporting the air ticket levy as an example.\n\nNow, structuring this into the required JSON fields. \n\nissueSum should be about the core issue he mentioned.

Ever since the Monterrey Conference in 2002 and the United Nations Summit in September 2005, the international community has recognised the need to rise to the challenge of development by executing a common policy integrating the Millennium Goals. At a time when the gap between the North and the South is ever widening and when the growing prosperity of industrialised countries is plunging many countries of the South back into poverty, it is high time the involvement of the international community took the form of practical measures.\nWhile the European Union is the main donor, it must do more today; it must work more effectively and it must move more swiftly. The European consensus on development and the new strategy for Africa are steps in the right direction, as was the recent announcement of the creation of a European fund to finance African projects, and I am delighted at these breakthroughs. Despite the increase in traditional public aid, the current figures show that the attainment of the Millennium Goals hinges on the adoption of mechanisms of complementary funding. On the initiative of several Member States, innovative and complementary financial instruments are being created. The European Union must work on implementing these instruments so as to produce stable and predictable resources needed to meet the unfulfilled requirements of developing countries, particularly in the health care sector. Several Member States already support these initiatives. Commissioner, you pointed out that some of these countries, including France, committed themselves to implementing international solidarity contributions, for example on flight tickets.\nAt the next ministerial conference, the Member States will strengthen the international consensus on the need to introduce innovative and practical sources of funding.

The task is to outline the main points made by Tokia Sa\u00effi, but only the parts attributed to her.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the debate summary and find any mentions of Tokia Sa\u00effi. Looking at the sections, under \"Key Positions and Approaches,\" there's a mention of Tokia Sa\u00effi. The exact quote is: \"Tokia Sa\u00effi argued that 'la r\u00e9alisation des objectifs du Mill\u00e9naire passe par l'adoption de m\u00e9canismes de financement compl\u00e9mentaire' (achieving the Millennium Goals requires adopting complementary financing mechanisms), advocating for the EU to be 'un fer de lance dans la r\u00e9alisation des objectifs du mill\u00e9naire pour le d\u00e9veloppement' (a spearhead in achieving the millennium development goals).\"\n\nSo, the issue she's addressing is the need for complementary financing mechanisms to achieve the Millennium Goals. Her position is that the EU should take a leading role. The argument here is that traditional aid isn't enough, so they need additional mechanisms. However, the summary doesn't mention any specific proposals from her beyond advocating for complementary mechanisms and the EU's leadership. \n\nWait, the user's example response includes \"issueSum\", \"positionSum\", \"argSum\", \"propSum\". So I need to structure that. \n\nFor \"issueSum\", it's the key issue she raised. The core issue in the debate was innovative financing, but specifically for her, it's the need for complementary mechanisms. \n\n\"positionSum\" would be her stance: supporting complementary financing and the EU as a spearhead. \n\n\"argSum\" would be the reasoning, but the summary doesn't give arguments from her, just her position. The debate summary mentions her argument as part of the key positions, but the actual argument is that complementary mechanisms are necessary. \n\n\"propSum\" would be her proposals. The summary says she advocated for the EU to be a spearhead, but maybe the proposal is adopting complementary mechanisms. However, the exact proposal is the complementary financing mechanisms. \n\nBut the user's example has \"propSum\" as a specific action. In her case, the proposal is to adopt complementary financing mechanisms. However, the summary doesn't mention any specific proposals beyond that.

Why did not the Commission put its own stamp on this idea? I take no pleasure whatsoever in searching for a solution outside our budgets: our countries should be quite serious about doing what they say they are going to do, but given that they are incapable of keeping their promises, this new idea at least has the virtue of not bothering anyone and of being unrestricted, if, in each of the Member States, it is the legislative authority that allocates this share of the profit to the World Food Programme instead of to the local State authorities.

Je n\u2019ai aucun plaisir \u00e0 chercher une solution en dehors de nos budgets: nos pays devraient \u00eatre assez s\u00e9rieux pour \u00e9lever leurs engagements au niveau de leurs promesses, mais comme ils n\u2019en sont pas capables, cette nouvelle id\u00e9e a au moins le m\u00e9rite de ne g\u00eaner personne et d\u2019\u00eatre sans contrainte, si ce n\u2019est l\u2019autorisation l\u00e9gale, dans chacun de nos \u00c9tats, d\u2019affecter cette part de profit au Programme alimentaire mondial plut\u00f4t qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9tat local.

The user provided a debate summary and wants the main points from Michel Rocard's speech. First, I need to scan through the debate summary to find any mentions of Michel Rocard.\n\nLooking at the \"Specific Proposals and Arguments\" section, there's a part about Michel Rocard proposing a global lottery system. The key points here are his criticism of rich countries not meeting their 0.7% aid commitment, his proposal for a lottery to generate funds for child hunger, and the estimated amount (400 million annually). \n\nI need to make sure I only include what's attributed to him. The summary mentions he criticized the failure to meet the 0.7% target and introduced the lottery idea. The arguments he used are based on the long-standing failure of rich countries and the potential of the lottery to generate funds. His proposal is the global lottery system. \n\nNow, structuring this into the required JSON fields. The issueSum should mention the lack of fulfillment of aid commitments and the need for new financing. PositionSum would state his advocacy for the lottery. The argument is that the lottery can generate funds despite the failure to meet existing targets. The proposal is the global lottery system. \n\nI need to check if there's any other info about him. The summary also says he's part of the PSE group, but the user didn't ask for that. Stick to the points mentioned. No other contributions from him are listed. So the JSON should reflect only his proposal, the argument behind it, and the issue he's addressing.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"Michel Rocard highlighted the failure of rich countries to meet their UN commitment to increase development aid to 0.7% of GDP and emphasized the need for innovative financing mechanisms to address global poverty and hunger.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"He advocated for a global lottery system as a novel approach to generate funds for development, criticizing the lack of progress in traditional aid commitments.\",\n\"argSum\": \"Rocard argued that the global lottery could provide a steady financial resource (400 million dollars annually) to combat child hunger, citing the long-standing failure of wealthy nations to fulfill their existing aid obligations.\",\n\"propSum\": \"He proposed the implementation of a global lottery system to raise funds for development purposes, specifically targeting child hunger.\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "President.", "english": "President. \u2013 I have received five motions for resolutions under Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.\nThe debate is closed.\nThe vote will take place on Thursday at 10 a.m.", "lang": "EN", "original": "President. \u2013 I have received five motions for resolutions under Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.\nThe debate is closed.\nThe vote will take place on Thursday at 10 a.m.", "agenda_item": "New financial instrument for development in connection with the Millenium Goals (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060214-ITEM-015", "intervention_id": "2-384", "summary_english": "```json\n{\n  \"headline\": \"\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"\",\n  \"positionSum\": \"\",\n  \"argSum\": \"\",\n  \"propSum\": \"\",\n  \"quotes\": []\n}\n```", "summary_original": "```json\n{\n  \"headline\": \"\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"\",\n  \"positionSum\": \"\",\n  \"argSum\": \"\",\n  \"propSum\": \"\",\n  \"quotes\": []\n}\n```", "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "method": "structured", "formatted_summary": {"headline": "", "issueSum": "", "positionSum": "", "argSum": "", "propSum": "", "quotes": []}, "reconstructed_position": "<think>\nOkay, let's see.
