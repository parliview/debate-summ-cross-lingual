Mr President, the Commission was asked last week by the European Parliament to make a statement on innovative sources of financing for development cooperation. Commissioner Michel cannot be here tonight as he is travelling to eastern Africa to previous engagements which could not be rescheduled. He is extremely sorry not to be able to share with you the Commission\u2019s views on this topic and has asked me to step in for him.\nAid needs to be substantially increased if the Millennium Development Goals are to be achieved. The European Union has not shied away from its responsibilities towards its partner countries. Quite the contrary: the European Council of June 2005 forcefully restated its support for the Millennium Development Goals with ambitious commitments on both the quality and the quantity of aid.\nIn particular, the European Council has committed itself to increasing official development assistance with the aim of achieving a target of 0.7% of gross national income in 2015. To that end, a collective target of 0.56% of GNI has been fixed for 2010.\nHowever, more aid will not be enough. We need to ensure that current and promised increases in financing are provided in ways which actually help countries meet their commitments to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.\nIn the recently approved joint statement by the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission on the European consensus for development, the European Union commits itself to the more predictable and less volatile aid mechanisms. The Commission believes that innovative mechanisms for financing development have a useful role to play. For this reason during 2005, at the request of the Council, the Commission produced a series of staff working papers providing technical analysis of innovative sources of financing for development.\nIn addition, in April 2005, the Commission adopted a communication to the Council and the European Parliament, \u2018Accelerating progress towards attaining the Millennium Development Goals \u2013 Financing for Development and Aid Effectiveness\u2019. Amongst other things, this communication discussed innovative sources of financing and new delivery aid mechanisms and invited the Council to \u2018agree to accelerate work on the most promising options for innovative additional sources of finance\u2019. The Commission noted that any innovative sources of financing must be assessed in light of a number of criteria. For example: how much would each proposal raise? To what extent would the funds be additional to existing commitments? How stable and predictable would they be? What are the competitiveness and sectoral impacts? What would the launch and administration costs be? Which proposals can go forward fastest? Is universal support required or can proposals be implemented at regional \u2013 that is EU \u2013 level?\nThe Commission notes France\u2019s readiness to start implementation of one of the proposals emerging from that debate, namely, the imposition of a solidarity contribution on all air tickets sold in France as of July 2006. This initiative may have a positive effect on other countries\u2019 readiness to carry forward initiatives in the area of financing for development.\nThe Commission would also like to inform the European Parliament that, to support the debate and preserve the momentum on these issues, a technical workshop between the Commission and Member State representatives was held on 9\u00a0February 2006. The workshop touched upon the existing initiatives, as well as possible alternatives with respect to innovative financing. The Commission, however, also looked at ways in which existing aid arrangements could be modified and complemented so as to deliver resources in more predictable ways.\nFinally, the Commission would like to note that, during the workshop, the French representatives gave an update on the high-level conference to be held in Paris on 28\u00a0February and 1\u00a0March.

Ever since the Monterrey Conference in 2002 and the United Nations Summit in September 2005, the international community has recognised the need to rise to the challenge of development by executing a common policy integrating the Millennium Goals. At a time when the gap between the North and the South is ever widening and when the growing prosperity of industrialised countries is plunging many countries of the South back into poverty, it is high time the involvement of the international community took the form of practical measures.\nWhile the European Union is the main donor, it must do more today; it must work more effectively and it must move more swiftly. The European consensus on development and the new strategy for Africa are steps in the right direction, as was the recent announcement of the creation of a European fund to finance African projects, and I am delighted at these breakthroughs. Despite the increase in traditional public aid, the current figures show that the attainment of the Millennium Goals hinges on the adoption of mechanisms of complementary funding. On the initiative of several Member States, innovative and complementary financial instruments are being created. The European Union must work on implementing these instruments so as to produce stable and predictable resources needed to meet the unfulfilled requirements of developing countries, particularly in the health care sector. Several Member States already support these initiatives. Commissioner, you pointed out that some of these countries, including France, committed themselves to implementing international solidarity contributions, for example on flight tickets.\nAt the next ministerial conference, the Member States will strengthen the international consensus on the need to introduce innovative and practical sources of funding.

This is a scandal, and we are all here to search for new ideas.\nI find it very regrettable that the Commission should have so few of them, and that the communication that you have been asked to read should be so flimsy. You did not even mention the British idea of a tax on the movement of capital. You only mentioned a French idea of a tax on the movement of aeroplanes. In this quest for new ideas, allow me to propose another one to you.\nI believe that it was in its document issued in April 2005 that the Commission proposed the idea of a global lottery. Mr Michel, whom I myself questioned during a sitting in this very Chamber, acknowledged that this was an option. You did not even take it up. Commissioner, I think that the option of a global lottery is easier to follow through than many other options.\nThe World Food Programme, which took up this idea with the aim of looking into it further, concluded that, on the basis of an estimated minimum of 1% of our countries\u2019 turnover being spent on each draw, four draws per year would raise an annual sum of USD\u00a0400\u00a0million, which the World Food Programme proposes allocating to the measures aimed at preventing children in the world from starving. Why did not the Commission put its own stamp on this idea? I take no pleasure whatsoever in searching for a solution outside our budgets: our countries should be quite serious about doing what they say they are going to do, but given that they are incapable of keeping their promises, this new idea at least has the virtue of not bothering anyone and of being unrestricted, if, in each of the Member States, it is the legislative authority that allocates this share of the profit to the World Food Programme instead of to the local State authorities. Setting up a global lottery is an easy thing to do. I therefore suggest to the Commission that it take the initiative in setting up the lottery and firmly encourages our Member States to implement it.", "lang": "FR", "original": "Michel Rocard (PSE). - Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, Monsieur le Commissaire, cela fait trente ans maintenant que les pays riches sont incapables de remplir l\u2019engagement qu\u2019ils ont pris devant l\u2019ONU d\u2019\u00e9lever leur aide au d\u00e9veloppement \u00e0 0,7%.

Debate Information\n\n**Topic:** New financial instrument for development in connection with the Millennium Goals  \n**Number of Contributions:** 8 speakers (9 slots with one empty)  \n**Date:** Not specified in provided materials  \n**Context:** Discussion on innovative financing mechanisms to achieve the UN Millennium Development Goals, with focus on complementing traditional development aid\n\n## 2. Executive Summary\n\n### Key Issues Identified\n\nThe debate centered on the urgent need for innovative financing mechanisms to achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. All speakers acknowledged that current development aid levels are insufficient, with traditional commitments to reach 0.7% of GDP in development assistance remaining unfulfilled by many wealthy nations for decades. The core challenge identified was finding predictable, stable, and additional funding sources beyond traditional aid budgets.\n\n### Positions and Arguments\n\n**Commission Perspective:** Charlie McCreevy outlined the Commission's supportive stance on innovative financing, emphasizing that \"more aid will not be enough. We need to ensure that current and promised increases in financing are provided in ways which actually help countries meet their commitments to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.\" The Commission supported France's solidarity contribution on air tickets as a positive model.\n\n**Strong Support for Multiple Mechanisms:** Several speakers advocated for diverse approaches. Tokia Sa\u00effi argued that \"the European Union must work on implementing these instruments so as to produce stable and predictable resources needed to meet the unfulfilled requirements of developing countries, particularly in the health care sector.\" Fiona Hall emphasized that \"no country has ever been lifted out of poverty by aid alone\" and supported exploring multiple financing methods including foreign direct investment.\n\n**International Financing Facility Advocacy:** Glenys Kinnock strongly promoted the UK's International Financing Facility proposal, highlighting its ability to provide \"frontloaded, long-term, stable and predictable funding\" that could \"prevent the needless deaths of 30,000 children every day.\"\n\n**Innovative Proposals:** Michel Rocard offered the most unconventional solution, criticizing that \"for 30 years now, the wealthy countries have been unable to fulfil the commitment they made before the UN to increase their development aid to 0.7%\" and proposing a global lottery system that could generate \"USD 400 million annually for preventing child starvation worldwide.\"\n\n### Common Concerns\n\n**Additionality:** Multiple speakers, including Caroline Lucas and Karin Scheele, stressed that any new financing must be \"genuinely additional to, and not a substitute for, existing development budgets.\" This concern reflected skepticism that innovative mechanisms might simply replace rather than supplement traditional aid commitments.\n\n**Urgency:** Alessandro Battilocchio captured the moral imperative, stating that \"in the current state of technological development and agricultural production, the fact that this situation persists is economically irrational, politically unacceptable and morally shameful.\"\n\n**Transparency and Accountability:** Caroline Lucas called for parliamentary oversight of development financing discussions, while Fiona Hall insisted that financing methods \"must have public support and they must never be covert.\"\n\n### Key Proposals\n\n1. **Air Ticket Solidarity Levy:** Supported by multiple speakers as implemented by France\n2. **International Financing Facility:** UK proposal for bond-based development financing\n3. **Global Lottery System:** French proposal for lottery-based funding\n4. **Enhanced Foreign Direct Investment:** Structured investment agreements under UN auspices\n5. **Accelerated National Commitments:** Faster implementation of 0.7% GDP targets\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe debate revealed broad consensus on the need for innovative development financing, with speakers agreeing that traditional aid commitments alone are insufficient. While supporting various mechanisms, participants emphasized the critical requirements of additionality, predictability, and transparency. The upcoming Paris conference on innovative financing was viewed as a crucial opportunity to translate these discussions into concrete action, with Karin Scheele warning that \"it is highly likely that we will fail to reach the development goals set by the international community\" without immediate additional funding mechanisms.", "src_model": "claude", "model_type": "claude", "model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "structured": true, "incremental": false, "hierarchical": false, "grouped": false, "shuffle": false, "prompt": false, "lang": "english"}
