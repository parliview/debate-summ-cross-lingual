{"speaker": "Tokia Sa\u00effi,", "english": "Tokia Sa\u00effi, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . \u2013 (FR) Mr\u00a0President, Commissioner, the European Union must play a leading role in ensuring that the Millennium Development Goals are attained. Ever since the Monterrey Conference in 2002 and the United Nations Summit in September 2005, the international community has recognised the need to rise to the challenge of development by executing a common policy integrating the Millennium Goals. At a time when the gap between the North and the South is ever widening and when the growing prosperity of industrialised countries is plunging many countries of the South back into poverty, it is high time the involvement of the international community took the form of practical measures.\nWhile the European Union is the main donor, it must do more today; it must work more effectively and it must move more swiftly. The European consensus on development and the new strategy for Africa are steps in the right direction, as was the recent announcement of the creation of a European fund to finance African projects, and I am delighted at these breakthroughs. Despite the increase in traditional public aid, the current figures show that the attainment of the Millennium Goals hinges on the adoption of mechanisms of complementary funding. On the initiative of several Member States, innovative and complementary financial instruments are being created. The European Union must work on implementing these instruments so as to produce stable and predictable resources needed to meet the unfulfilled requirements of developing countries, particularly in the health care sector. Several Member States already support these initiatives. Commissioner, you pointed out that some of these countries, including France, committed themselves to implementing international solidarity contributions, for example on flight tickets.\nAt the next ministerial conference, the Member States will strengthen the international consensus on the need to introduce innovative and practical sources of funding. This meeting must provide the opportunity to build on the momentum generated in New York during the last United Nations Summit.", "lang": "FR", "original": "Tokia Sa\u00effi, au nom du groupe PPE-DE . - Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, Monsieur le Commissaire, l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne se doit d\u2019\u00eatre un fer de lance dans la r\u00e9alisation des objectifs du mill\u00e9naire pour le d\u00e9veloppement. Depuis la conf\u00e9rence de Monterrey de 2002 et le sommet des Nations unies de septembre 2005, la communaut\u00e9 internationale a compris qu\u2019il fallait relever le d\u00e9fi du d\u00e9veloppement en menant une politique commune int\u00e9grant les objectifs du Mill\u00e9naire. \u00c0 l\u2019heure o\u00f9 le foss\u00e9 ne cesse de se creuser entre le Nord et le Sud et o\u00f9 la prosp\u00e9rit\u00e9 grandissante des pays industrialis\u00e9s renvoie \u00e0 la pauvret\u00e9 de nombreux pays du Sud, il est grand temps que la mobilisation de la communaut\u00e9 internationale se traduise par des actions concr\u00e8tes.\nSi l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne est la principale donatrice, aujourd\u2019hui elle doit faire plus, elle doit faire mieux et elle doit aller plus vite. Le consensus europ\u00e9en pour le d\u00e9veloppement et la nouvelle strat\u00e9gie pour l\u2019Afrique vont dans ce sens, comme la r\u00e9cente annonce de la cr\u00e9ation d\u2019un fonds europ\u00e9en pour financer des projets africains, et je m\u2019en r\u00e9jouis. Malgr\u00e9 l\u2019augmentation de l\u2019aide publique traditionnelle, les chiffres actuels montrent que la r\u00e9alisation des objectifs du Mill\u00e9naire passe par l\u2019adoption de m\u00e9canismes de financement compl\u00e9mentaire. \u00c0 l\u2019initiative de plusieurs \u00c9tats membres, des instruments financiers innovants et compl\u00e9mentaires voient le jour.

Plusieurs \u00c9tats membres soutiennent d\u00e9j\u00e0 ces initiatives. Certains d\u2019entre eux, dont la France, vous l\u2019avez rappel\u00e9, Monsieur le Commissaire, se sont engag\u00e9s \u00e0 mettre en place des contributions internationales de solidarit\u00e9, notamment sur les billets d\u2019avions.\nLors de la prochaine conf\u00e9rence minist\u00e9rielle, les \u00c9tats membres approfondiront le consensus international sur la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019instaurer des sources innovantes et concr\u00e8tes de financement.
