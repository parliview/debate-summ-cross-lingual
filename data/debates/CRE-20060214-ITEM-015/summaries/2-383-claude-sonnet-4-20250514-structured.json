{"speaker": "Michel Rocard (PSE). \u2013", "english": "Michel Rocard (PSE). \u2013 (FR) Mr\u00a0President, Commissioner, for 30 years now, the wealthy countries have been unable to fulfil the commitment they made before the UN to increase their development aid to 0.7%. This is a scandal, and we are all here to search for new ideas.\nI find it very regrettable that the Commission should have so few of them, and that the communication that you have been asked to read should be so flimsy. You did not even mention the British idea of a tax on the movement of capital. You only mentioned a French idea of a tax on the movement of aeroplanes. In this quest for new ideas, allow me to propose another one to you.\nI believe that it was in its document issued in April 2005 that the Commission proposed the idea of a global lottery. Mr Michel, whom I myself questioned during a sitting in this very Chamber, acknowledged that this was an option. You did not even take it up. Commissioner, I think that the option of a global lottery is easier to follow through than many other options.\nThe World Food Programme, which took up this idea with the aim of looking into it further, concluded that, on the basis of an estimated minimum of 1% of our countries\u2019 turnover being spent on each draw, four draws per year would raise an annual sum of USD\u00a0400\u00a0million, which the World Food Programme proposes allocating to the measures aimed at preventing children in the world from starving. Why did not the Commission put its own stamp on this idea? I take no pleasure whatsoever in searching for a solution outside our budgets: our countries should be quite serious about doing what they say they are going to do, but given that they are incapable of keeping their promises, this new idea at least has the virtue of not bothering anyone and of being unrestricted, if, in each of the Member States, it is the legislative authority that allocates this share of the profit to the World Food Programme instead of to the local State authorities. Setting up a global lottery is an easy thing to do. I therefore suggest to the Commission that it take the initiative in setting up the lottery and firmly encourages our Member States to implement it.", "lang": "FR", "original": "Michel Rocard (PSE). - Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, Monsieur le Commissaire, cela fait trente ans maintenant que les pays riches sont incapables de remplir l\u2019engagement qu\u2019ils ont pris devant l\u2019ONU d\u2019\u00e9lever leur aide au d\u00e9veloppement \u00e0 0,7%. C\u2019est un scandale et nous sommes tous ici pour rechercher des id\u00e9es neuves.\nJe trouve tr\u00e8s regrettable que la Commission en ait si peu et que la communication qu\u2019on vous a charg\u00e9 de lire soit aussi creuse. Vous n\u2019avez m\u00eame pas cit\u00e9 l\u2019id\u00e9e britannique de la taxation des mouvements de capitaux. Vous n\u2019avez cit\u00e9 qu\u2019une id\u00e9e fran\u00e7aise de taxation des mouvements d\u2019avions. Dans cette qu\u00eate d\u2019id\u00e9es neuves, laissez-moi vous en proposer une de plus.\nLa Commission, dans son document du mois d\u2019avril de l\u2019ann\u00e9e derni\u00e8re, je crois, \u00e9mettait l\u2019id\u00e9e d\u2019une loterie mondiale. Le commissaire Michel, interrog\u00e9 par mes soins, ici m\u00eame en s\u00e9ance, a reconnu que c\u2019\u00e9tait une possibilit\u00e9. Vous ne l\u2019avez m\u00eame pas reprise. Monsieur le Commissaire, je la crois plus facile \u00e0 r\u00e9aliser que beaucoup d\u2019autres.\nLe Programme alimentaire mondial, qui a repris cette id\u00e9e pour l\u2019\u00e9tudier, a conclu, qu\u2019avec quatre tirages annuels par an sur la base d\u2019une \u00e9valuation minimale de 1% du chiffre d\u2019affaires du jeu dans nos pays, on r\u00e9colterait 400\u00a0millions de dollars par an que le Programme alimentaire mondial propose d\u2019affecter \u00e0 la lutte contre la faim des enfants dans le monde. Pourquoi la Commission n\u2019a-t-elle pas fait sienne cette id\u00e9e? Je n\u2019ai aucun plaisir \u00e0 chercher une solution en dehors de nos budgets: nos pays devraient \u00eatre assez s\u00e9rieux pour \u00e9lever leurs engagements au niveau de leurs promesses, mais comme ils n\u2019en sont pas capables, cette nouvelle id\u00e9e a au moins le m\u00e9rite de ne g\u00eaner personne et d\u2019\u00eatre sans contrainte, si ce n\u2019est l\u2019autorisation l\u00e9gale, dans chacun de nos \u00c9tats, d\u2019affecter cette part de profit au Programme alimentaire mondial plut\u00f4t qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9tat local.
