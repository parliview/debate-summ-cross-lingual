{"speaker": "Caroline Lucas,", "english": "Caroline Lucas, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . \u2013 Mr President, I thank the Commissioner. One of the reasons why we are discussing this issue tonight is because there is an international conference in Paris at the end of this month, a key opportunity to make progress on the subject of innovative sources of finance for development. My group particularly welcomes the fact that this meeting looks set to agree an air ticket levy with proceeds going to benefit some of the world\u2019s poorest people. Of course there are a range of other tools and instruments as well. Mrs\u00a0Kinnock has already spoken very eloquently about the benefits of the IFF. However, I believe that the air ticket levy is also important because it marks a turning point in the quest for the introduction of global levies for the financing of global development needs. It deserves our full support. I would stress, however, that the new finances must be genuinely new: in other words, additional to, and not a substitute for, existing development budgets.\nI am very glad that the Commission will be represented at the meeting in Paris, but I would like to know whether it has plans to encourage the other Member States to go, whether there will be a mechanism for feeding back to Parliament the results of the meeting in Paris, and whether there are plans to share the contents of the workshop that took place on 9\u00a0February between the Commission and the Council. I am sure that many of us would be very interested to know.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Caroline Lucas, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . \u2013 Mr President, I thank the Commissioner.
