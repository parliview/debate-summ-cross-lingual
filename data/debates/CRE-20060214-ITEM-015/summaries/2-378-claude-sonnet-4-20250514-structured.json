{"speaker": "Glenys Kinnock,", "english": "Glenys Kinnock, on behalf of the PSE Group . \u2013 Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to talk about the potential offered by the International Financing Facility proposed by the UK Chancellor Gordon Brown.

It raises one billion a year, which can be used to get children into school and to abolish the fees that jeopardise the education of millions of children in developing countries, especially little girls.\nThe IFF has already put in place a pilot scheme for immunisation, which is searching for vaccines for malaria and for HIV/AIDS \u2013 the scourge in Africa and many other parts of the world \u2013 for which there is no cure. The agreement is to provide a global advanced purchasing scheme to make sure that life-saving vaccines are commercially produced at affordable prices and that these are produced in ways of which we in this Parliament should all approve and which we should find essential at this time.\nWe acknowledge that meeting the Millennium Development Goals, which is part of the purpose of this debate, is difficult, but if we can put the money in place \u2013 predictable money \u2013 then we will get every child into school and we will prevent the needless deaths of 30\u00a0000 children every day. That is what we are talking about; that is about us trying to translate hope into reality.\nWhen he heard about the IFF, Nelson Mandela said that it was an absolutely necessary and timely initiative that deserves an active response from the international community. I very much hope that the European Union will support this initiative firmly and in a very committed way.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Glenys Kinnock, on behalf of the PSE Group . \u2013 Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to talk about the potential offered by the International Financing Facility proposed by the UK Chancellor Gordon Brown.
