Over a billion people in the world live in extreme poverty, surviving on less than a dollar a day. Millions of children still die each year through lack of appropriate health care, clean water, decent dwellings and adequate nutrition, while 20\u00a0000 people a day die of causes linked to a shortage of food.\nIn the current state of technological development and agricultural production, the fact that this situation persists is economically irrational, politically unacceptable and morally shameful. We are therefore eagerly and hopefully looking forward to the work of the forthcoming Paris conference, although we are well aware that not only are greater resources needed, but also other kinds of resources, which must be diverse, innovative and also, perhaps, predictable and stable.\nThe biggest scandal is not that there is still hunger in the world, but that it persists even though the international community has the means to eliminate it.
