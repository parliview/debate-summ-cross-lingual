{"speaker": "Paolo Costa,", "english": "Paolo Costa, on behalf of the ALDE Group . \u2013 (IT) Mr\u00a0President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in my language, the word \u2018 sicurezza \u2019 covers the meaning of the two English words \u2018safety\u2019 and \u2018security\u2019. It seems to me, however, that today\u2019s confusion cannot be ascribed purely to the linguistic factor.\nThese two subjects are too important to be tackled together. I must admit, however, that when it comes to the \u2018safety\u2019 aspect of the word, it is thanks to the contribution of Parliament that fundamental progress has been made with regard to driving time and driving licences.\nI would like to make just one point: the greatest contribution we could probably make to road safety would be to make less people use the roads. If we worked harder and faster on the third railway package, therefore, we would perhaps succeed in making a more significant contribution to safety than any of the other proposals that have been illustrated today.\nComing, though, to the \u2018security\u2019 sense of the word, and to its financing \u2013 which is a problem that concerns me directly, as rapporteur of this measure \u2013 I ask myself the following question: \u2018Can we proceed with amending the regulation in accordance with the standards that define security without answering the question our citizens are asking, namely who will pay for it?\u2019 This strikes me as the key point. It is rather difficult to answer \u2018yes\u2019, partly because we have also come to realise that security is a single issue, that there are not 25 types of security and that it is not possible for each Member State to establish its own security.\nIf, however, a single security exists for all countries, then we cannot do anything other than define standard, potentially uniform, measures, and establish in a clear, transparent way how to pay for it. There could then also be additional measures, which are more stringent and apply only in particular countries. Even in this case, though, how can we guarantee that these independent measures do not interfere negatively with, and have repercussions on, the security of the other countries?\nWhile we wait, reality moves on. What we have today is, in fact, a basic security financed through fares and extra ticket costs, and more or less cofinanced by the Member States according to the levels of security they wish to establish. This system must be regulated differently. I think that the Member States should at least pay for the surplus measures and that it is essential that there be clarity regarding the basic level of cofinance between operator or, better, user Member States. We must follow these principles at least in order to continue our work.", "lang": "IT", "original": "Paolo Costa, a nome del gruppo ALDE . \u2013 Signor Presidente, signor Commissario, onorevoli colleghi, nella mia lingua, il termine \u201csicurezza\u201d si adopera sia per il termine inglese \u201c safety \u201d che per il termine \u201c security \u201d. Tuttavia, mi sembra che la confusione che ci \u00e8 stata oggi non dipenda solo dal fattore linguistico.\nSi tratta di due temi troppo importanti per essere affrontati insieme. Tuttavia devo ammettere che per la cosiddetta sicurezza, nel senso di safety , \u00e8 grazie al contributo del Parlamento che sono stati compiuti dei passi in avanti fondamentali per quanto riguarda il tempo di guida e la patente di guida.\nVorrei ricordare solo un punto: il maggior contributo alla sicurezza stradale potremmo darlo probabilmente facendo andare meno gente sulle strade e quindi, se lavorassimo di pi\u00f9 e pi\u00f9 rapidamente sul terzo pacchetto ferroviario, forse riusciremmo ad apportare un contributo alla sicurezza pi\u00f9 importante di tutte le altre proposte che sono state illustrate oggi.\nMa venendo alla security e al suo finanziamento \u2013 che \u00e8 un problema che mi riguarda direttamente come relatore di questo provvedimento \u2013 mi pongo la seguente domanda: \u201cPossiamo procedere alla modifica del regolamento sugli standard che definiscono la sicurezza, senza rispondere alla domanda che si pongono i nostri cittadini, su chi la paga?\u201d Mi pare che questo sia il punto fondamentale. \u00c8 un po\u2019 difficile rispondere di s\u00ec, anche perch\u00e9 al contempo ci siamo resi conto che la sicurezza \u00e8 una sola, non ne esistono 25 e non \u00e8 possibile che ogni Stato membro stabilisca la propria sicurezza.\nMa, se esiste un\u2019unica sicurezza per tutti i paesi, noi non possiamo non definire misure standard tendenzialmente uniformi e non stabilire in modo chiaro e trasparente come finanziarla. Ci potranno poi essere anche delle misure aggiuntive, pi\u00f9 stringenti e vigenti solo in determinati paesi, ma, anche in questo caso, come si potr\u00e0 garantire che queste misure indipendenti non interferiscano negativamente e abbiano delle ripercussioni sulla sicurezza degli altri paesi?\nMentre noi aspettiamo, la realt\u00e0 avanza. Oggi abbiamo, di fatto, una sicurezza di base che \u00e8 finanziata per mezzo di tariffe, costi extra sui biglietti ed \u00e8 pi\u00f9 o meno cofinanziata dagli Stati membri a seconda dei livelli di sicurezza che essi intendono stabilire. Occorre che questo sistema sia regolato in modo diverso: ritengo che gli Stati debbano farsi carico almeno delle misure eccedenti ed \u00e8 indispensabile fare chiarezza sul livello base di cofinanziamento tra Stati operatori, o meglio tra Stati utenti.
