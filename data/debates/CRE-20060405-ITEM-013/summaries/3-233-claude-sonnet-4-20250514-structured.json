{"speaker": "Hubert Gorbach,", "english": "Hubert Gorbach, President-in-Office of the Council . (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I will do my best to be brief. The Austrian Presidency plans to deal with the question of the financing of security measures in the next Council working group, which takes place tomorrow, 6 April, and in particular to discuss the way forward with this dossier, especially as the Commission has now announced that it will not be presenting its study on the matter until the end of 2006. In any case, close contact between Council Presidency, Commission and Parliament is essential in this matter, especially since we want to reach agreement with Parliament quickly. I will gladly discuss in detail all questions of financing as the Council Presidency sees them, but there is no time for that today. I have tried to report on road safety, on which the Council has focussed in the last few weeks and months, and to do so in close contact with the Commission, which has concentrated more on the financing of security in aviation, for example.\nHow difficult this question of financing is is shown by the fact that there are also different views in the European Parliament, as is evident from the Costa report and also from what you said, Mr Jarzembowski. Of course I know as well as you do that we need clear rules, if only in order to have fair conditions of competition and for reasons of transparency. I also believe that this really is about fighting terrorism, and that must be a national function, because if it is passed on to the airlines, the responsibility will again lie with the passenger, and I do not believe that is where it belongs. The passenger has the right to adequate protection against threats, in one form or another. That is why my clear position is that all this is a national function, and we have to face up to that.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Hubert Gorbach, President-in-Office of the Council .
