{"speaker": "Jacques Barrot,", "english": "Jacques Barrot, Vice-President of the Commission . (FR) Madam President, Mr Gorbach, ladies and gentlemen, contrary to what one of you said, I am well aware of the importance of both road safety and security problems. We are working on these issues, and I have listened very carefully to what has been said in this debate.\nI should like to point out that, in its communication on the repercussions of the 11 September attacks on the air transport sector, the Commission has already stressed that the public authorities should take responsibility for strengthening certain security measures put in place by the public authorities in the wake of those attacks, which were attacks on the whole of society and not solely on those involved in the transport sector. I believe I share Mr\u00a0Costa\u2019s view on this distinction, which will probably be one of the guiding principles of any future stance taken by the European institutions.\nAs I said, Madam President, air transport safety studies have been carried out, and the findings of maritime transport studies will soon be made known to Parliament. What these studies reveal \u2013 and I quoted some figures earlier \u2013 is that the costs of security measures can be high even if they may seem insignificant in relation to the overall cost of transport. In spite of everything, they are, in absolute terms, costs, and I said just before in this Chamber that we shall certainly be bringing up this issue tomorrow and the day after tomorrow in this meeting between European transport companies and the airports.\nIt is true that different Member States have different approaches to funding, that there is a certain lack of transparency and that we must try to assess and rectify any distortion of competition.\nMr Jarzembowski, Mr\u00a0El\u00a0Khadhraoui and Mrs\u00a0Lichtenberger, I note your impatience. I should like to point out that, while it awaits the findings of the maritime transport study, the Commission is drawing up a report, to be ready by the summer, which will respond to the interinstitutional statement on the regulation on implementing common rules in the field of civil aviation security, as well as to the regulation on enhancing ship and port facility security. Let me assure you that we will have completed this report by the beginning of the summer.\nI hope that I will be able to benefit from today\u2019s debate, even though it has been too short to cover every aspect of the issue. I should like to thank Parliament for its commitment to this important matter and the Presidency for enabling us to raise this tricky but very important issue.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Jacques Barrot, Vice-President of the Commission .
