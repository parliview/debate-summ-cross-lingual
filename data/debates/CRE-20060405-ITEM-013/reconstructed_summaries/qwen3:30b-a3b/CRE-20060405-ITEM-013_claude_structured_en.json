The user provided a debate summary and wants the main points from the speaker named \"President.\" But wait, in the debate summary, the speaker mentioned is \"Hubert Gorbach, representing the Austrian Presidency,\" not a President. Maybe \"President\" here refers to Gorbach as the Austrian Presidency representative.\n\nFirst, I need to check the debate summary for any contributions from the Austrian Presidency. The summary mentions Hubert Gorbach from the Austrian Presidency. The user's instruction says to only include points attributed to the specified speaker, which in this case is \"President.\" But the actual speaker's name is Hubert Gorbach. However, the user might have used \"President\" as a placeholder or referring to his role. \n\nLooking at the debate summary, Gorbach's contributions are about road safety targets. He mentions that the EU might not meet the 2010 target, with current projections at 32,500 fatalities. He also talks about motorcycle fatalities increasing. Additionally, he mentions that counter-terrorism is a public function and that financing should be public, not passed to passengers or airlines. \n\nWait, the user's example response includes issueSum, positionSum, etc. So I need to extract Gorbach's points. The user's query says \"Speaker Name: President.\" But in the debate, the Austrian Presidency is represented by Gorbach. So maybe the user intended to refer to him as the President. \n\nSo, the main points from Gorbach (assuming \"President\" refers to him) are:\n\n- Road safety targets not being met, with specific numbers.\n- Concerns about motorcycle fatalities.\n- Security financing should be public, not on passengers or airlines.\n\nNow, structure this into the JSON fields. The issueSum would be about road safety targets and security financing. PositionSum would be his stance on public financing. ArgSum would be the reasoning, like counter-terrorism being a public duty. PropSum would be his proposals for public funding.\n\nBut need to make sure not to include other speakers' points. Check the debate summary again to confirm Gorbach's contributions. Yes, he did mention the 2010 target, motorcycle fatalities, and public financing for security. \n\nSo the JSON should reflect those points. The user's example uses specific language, so I need to paraphrase accordingly without including other speakers' arguments.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The key issues raised by the speaker relate to the EU's progress toward road safety targets and the financing of transport security measures.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"The speaker emphasized that counter-terrorism and transport security are public responsibilities, not to be shifted onto passengers or airlines, and highlighted the EU's failure to meet road safety targets.\",\n\"argSum\": \"The speaker argued that public funding is necessary for security measures to avoid placing financial burdens on passengers and that the EU's current road safety progress is insufficient, with projections showing higher fatalities than target levels.\",\n\"propSum\": \"The speaker called for public financing of transport security measures and urged accelerated action to meet road safety targets, particularly addressing the rising trend of motorcycle fatalities.\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Hubert Gorbach,", "english": "Hubert Gorbach, President-in-Office of the Council . (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my gratitude to you for having the topic of road safety on the order of business for today. As you know, making people in every European state even more aware of this issue than they already are is a particular concern of the Austrian Presidency, the intention being that this should lay another vital foundation stone for a common European road safety policy.\nIt was this that led the Presidency to call the informal meeting in Bregenz in Austria on 2 and 3 March, the object being to devote two whole days, at European level, to road safety to the exclusion of all else. In the course of this meeting, and during numerous bilateral conversations, we succeeded in doing justice to the Austrian Presidency's slogan: \u2018Crossing Borders in Road Safety \u2013 Creating a Trans-European Road Safety Culture\u2019.\nI am, then, very grateful to the Commission for its presentation of the mid-term review of the European Road Safety Action Programme, which was discussed during the informal meeting of transport ministers on 2 and 3 March, which I have already mentioned, and most recently at the Council of Transport Ministers on 27\u00a0March in Brussels. It is at this point that I would like to make an advance announcement to the effect that the Austrian Presidency also intends that the formal Council of Ministers in Luxembourg on 9\u00a0June should adopt final conclusions on road safety.\nThe European Road Safety Action Programme, which dates back to 2003 and aims to reduce by half the number of deaths in road traffic in the European Union by 2010, lays down EU-wide road safety targets for the period from 2003 to 2010, and includes 60 measures to be implemented across the EU, most of which are not legislative in character. This constitutes a consistent reiteration of the priority of road safety, which had already been laid down in the 2001 White Paper on Transport.\nUnderpinning all these efforts towards road safety is the long-term determination that in future no more citizens of the EU should be killed or seriously injured in road accidents. A great deal of joint effort is still required if we are to progress further towards this goal. It is abundantly clear from the mid-term review of the EU Road Safety Action Programme, which Vice-President Barrot presented to the meeting I have already mentioned, that Europe may well be on the right road, but is still proceeding at too low a speed.\nLet me mention just two or three striking figures, which Mr\u00a0Barrot has already put before us. The goal of having some 25\u00a0000 road traffic fatalities in 2010, lamentable though they would still be, might well be achieved if we were already making better progress. If we were to extrapolate from what we have achieved so far, we would end up with a figure of 32\u00a0500. We must step up all our efforts in order to achieve as far as possible the ambitious target we have set ourselves.\nA successful transport policy rests on three essential pillars \u2013 people, vehicles and infrastructure, and, in the course of the meeting to which I have referred, we were able to discuss all three of them in detail. What does give cause for concern \u2013 and this is something I particularly want to stress today \u2013 is the trend as regards the numbers of motorcycle and moped users killed. They constitute the only category of road users among whom the number of deaths is increasing rather than decreasing. If this trend is not stopped, there will, in 2010, be only half as many people killed on Europe\u2019s roads, but one out of every three of them will be a motorcyclist, as against the present one in six.\nPassing on to infrastructure, Europe must be aware of its responsibility for making suitable instruments available to infrastructure operators, for only if it does so will we succeed in minimising the risk to those who travel on our European road networks. Where vehicles are concerned, it should be emphasised that modern e-safety technology can make a quite essential contribution to improving road safety. E-safety technology is intended to ensure an intelligent link between man and machine and to enable drivers to free themselves from routine actions.\nOne of the things on which the informal Council in Bregenz (Austria) focussed was the subject of public awareness. In Bregenz we had a very brief and concentrated opportunity to study and compare our European colleagues\u2019 activities in raising public awareness. The evaluation of the various campaign activities showed that targeted awareness campaigns can in fact achieve a great deal. We in Austria, too, have done a lot in this regard in the last few years, stirring people up, thinking or making people think and ultimately, and most importantly, getting people to change their behaviour in a way that makes for greater road safety and fewer road deaths, fewer people injured and seriously injured in road accidents.\nWe also agreed that a joint European awareness campaign on the subject could bring synergy effects and greater effectiveness. On the basis of a poll, we found that the subjects of drunken driving and fatigue at the wheel should be tackled as a matter of priority. I am pleased to say that the Commission promised to provide assistance, chiefly of an organisational nature and of course within the rules that apply, and suggested that the High Level Group on Road Safety could be asked to develop a proposal to that effect.\nThe Commission\u2019s intention of also introducing a \u2018European Road Safety Day\u2019 is also fully in line with our common objectives for enhancing road safety. I am sure that an initiative of that kind will also help to create greater public awareness throughout Europe. My special thanks are due here to Vice-President and Commissioner Jacques Barrot for his particular commitment.\nSignificant efforts have been made since 2001 to make Europe\u2019s roads safer. A number of legislative measures have been taken in both the technical and regulatory fields, for example provisions governing seat belts, the digital tachograph, driving and rest periods, the driving licence or rules for professional lorry drivers. Initiatives such as CARS 21 or the European Road Safety Charter, which create awareness in European local authorities, regions, undertakings, associations etc., should also be mentioned here. Vice-President Barrot\u2019s activities and initiatives, which include proposals already announced for daytime running lights, blind-spot mirrors and in the field of infrastructure, will help to make our roads safer at European level.\nMay I say in conclusion that if the problems in some Member States with a high level of transit traffic are even greater than the European average, then we should start where the figures are not falling very much or where fatalities are in some cases still rising, for every death on Europe\u2019s roads is one such death too many.\nI want to thank Parliament for the opportunity of speaking on this important topic of road safety today and I would like to say that we must not flag in our efforts to make Europe\u2019s roads as safe as possible and thereby prevent much misery and grief.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Hubert Gorbach, President-in-Office of the Council .

(FR) Mr\u00a0President, Mr\u00a0Gorbach, ladies and gentlemen, the debate on the agenda concerns two issues: road safety and security measures in the transport sector.\nI should like to echo what Mr\u00a0Gorbach said in his excellent speech and to thank him straightaway for his personal commitment to this great cause that is road safety. Thank you, Mr\u00a0Gorbach, for having placed this major problem of road safety at the heart of the Austrian Presidency\u2019s priorities.\nJust as I, myself, had to do when I gave an account, after five years, of our assessment on the basis of the programme that the European Union had set itself in 2002, we must note that the countries comprising today\u2019s European Union saw 50\u00a0000 people die on the roads in 2001. The common objective proposed in 2001 and updated today is not to exceed the figure of 25\u00a0000 deaths in 2010. To save 25\u00a0000 lives!\nWhat stage are we at with this? In 2005, we still recorded 41\u00a0600 deaths. That corresponds to a reduction of 17.5% in four years. Considerable progress has been made in some Member States in particular, but it is not enough. As you said, Mr\u00a0Gorbach, the number of deaths in the Union is in danger of increasing to 32\u00a0500 in the year 2010 if we do not take it upon ourselves to give new impetus to this road safety policy. Greater efforts are necessary, and the disparities between the Member States must be rectified.\nThe Austrian Presidency has enabled us to make progress with an agreement on the European driving licence, for which I should like to express my gratitude once again. I would point out that this driving licence is accompanied by a licence for mopeds and a progressive licence for the most powerful motorcycles. That should enable us to reduce the number of motorcycle deaths, which is increasing at an alarming rate.\nOver and above this assessment and over and above the progress made during this Presidency, the Commission will present, in 2006, new initiatives to be included in the action plan that I will propose in the revised White Paper.\nFirstly, a proposal for a directive on the management of road safety in the trans-European network. It is not a question of us explaining how a road should be made safer, but of the European Union confirming, in each of the Member States, that a great deal of attention is paid to safety when a new road is built or an existing one is improved.\nSecondly, a proposal for a directive that will enable cross-border legal action to be taken in the most serious cases of a violation of the highway code: speeding, drink driving and driving without wearing a seat belt. It is not right that the perpetrator of a serious offence should escape punishment simply by crossing the border.\nFinally, as you said, Mr\u00a0Gorbach, we are going to close a loophole in the current legislation regarding the blind-spot mirrors fitted to existing heavy goods vehicles. We are also endeavouring to make progress with the idea of a third \u2018daytime\u2019 running light. Some Member States already want the opportunity to request this extra equipment for cars. Together with my colleague, Mr\u00a0Verheugen, we are now going to examine how this issue should be dealt with and what follow-up action should be taken in relation to the recommendations made by the CARS 21 group, which has listed a whole host of safety equipment that is likely to be very beneficial to the vehicles on Europe's roads.\nIn concluding this first point, I should like to confirm that our assessment of the progress made in the field of road safety will continue on an annual basis. Mr\u00a0Gorbach also mentioned the idea of a European Road Safety Day, as well as the launch of awareness campaigns, events that will all need to be carried out at European level. I can confirm to Parliament that we are working in conjunction with the Presidency on all of these matters.\nIf you will allow me, I am now going to address the issue of the security of modes of transport, including the difficult subject of how they are financed. I know that this issue worries the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission. Following the events of 11\u00a0September 2001, the Commission proposed a framework regulation designed to lay down common rules in the field of civil aviation security. The support of Parliament, together with that of the Council, was crucial to the successful conclusion of that legislative process. That regulation was accompanied by an interinstitutional declaration in which our three institutions reaffirmed their determination to enhance the quality of aviation security systems in the Community. Furthermore, it seemed necessary to prevent any distortion of internal and external competition.\nFinally, the three institutions noted the Commission\u2019s intention to commission a study concerning the way in which the financing of security is divided up between public authorities and operators. The Commission committed itself to submitting to the European Parliament and the Council the results and the proposals that would emerge from this study. A similar position was taken when the regulation on the improvement of ships and ports security was adopted in 2004. The regulation recognised that the actual, uniform application of security measures raised important questions, which were always linked to financing. In that respect, the Commission also had to embark upon a study with a view to sending information to the European Parliament and to examining any proposals that would be worth presenting.\nThe Commission put in place, from 2004, an inspection system that has helped significantly to enhance aviation security. To date, the Commission has carried out 69 inspections in all of the Member States. In the light of these inspections, the Commission proposed, at the end of 2005, the revision of Regulation 2320/2002, which is currently being looked into by the Committee on Transport and Tourism and for which you, Mr\u00a0Costa, are the rapporteur. Together with this proposal for a revision, the Commission presented the first annual report on the implementation of the regulation currently in force, as well as the main results of the inspections.\nFurthermore, I would highlight the fact that the regulatory committee created by the framework regulation of 2002 has worked hard and has made it possible for eight implementing regulations to be adopted. The Commission has also launched two crucial studies, which have confirmed the importance of the issue of financing.\nAs regards aviation, the study was brought to completion in 2004. The results were published on the Commission\u2019s website. The study on the financing of maritime security will shortly be completed, and the results will be submitted to you as soon as they become available.\nAs regards civil aviation security, the study carried out shows that the costs incurred within the Union, which consisted at that time of 15 Member States, fluctuated between EUR\u00a02.5\u00a0billion and EUR\u00a03.6\u00a0billion in 2002. We can regard this amount as a large figure at the same time as emphasising the fact that, in the field of intra-Community transport, the combination of airport and security charges and taxes represented 1% to 2% of the average price of flight tickets.\nThis study also highlighted some differences in the methods of financing. There are major differences as regards the role of the State. The study also highlighted a certain lack of transparency as regards security taxes and charges. In that respect, I must explain to Parliament that I have decided to organise a meeting between all of the air traffic operators, which will be held tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. This meeting will mainly focus on airport taxes, but it will certainly reflect on these security problems and their associated cost.\nOn the subject of maritime security, the preliminary results from the study also confirm that the costs are substantial, even though expenditure in the maritime sector is rather limited in relation to the total costs. The European Union has more than 1\u00a0200 seaports and around 3\u00a0700 port facilities, for which, according to this report, the average investment in security amounts to more than EUR\u00a0400\u00a0000, with running costs exceeding EUR\u00a0200\u00a0000 per year. As regards the security of ships, the average investment stands at EUR\u00a0100\u00a0000, with running costs of around EUR\u00a025\u00a0000 per year.\nThose are the facts in relation to this complex problem. I recognise that it is a major problem, but I also have to admit that it is now difficult to say for certain that we can find a solution that can be imposed on everyone. That is why we must reflect together on these security problems and on the way in which they will be financed, and I am delighted to hear your contributions on this subject. This is a problem that will obviously have to be dealt with very rigorously in the future.\nThat, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is what I wanted to say, and I should like to thank you and to thank the Austrian Presidency for allowing us to hold this debate on the two issues of road safety and security problems.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Jacques Barrot, Vice-President of the Commission . (FR) Mr\u00a0President, Mr\u00a0Gorbach, ladies and gentlemen, the debate on the agenda concerns two issues: road safety and security measures in the transport sector.\nI should like to echo what Mr\u00a0Gorbach said in his excellent speech and to thank him straightaway for his personal commitment to this great cause that is road safety. Thank you, Mr\u00a0Gorbach, for having placed this major problem of road safety at the heart of the Austrian Presidency\u2019s priorities.\nJust as I, myself, had to do when I gave an account, after five years, of our assessment on the basis of the programme that the European Union had set itself in 2002, we must note that the countries comprising today\u2019s European Union saw 50\u00a0000 people die on the roads in 2001. The common objective proposed in 2001 and updated today is not to exceed the figure of 25\u00a0000 deaths in 2010. To save 25\u00a0000 lives!\nWhat stage are we at with this? In 2005, we still recorded 41\u00a0600 deaths. That corresponds to a reduction of 17.5% in four years. Considerable progress has been made in some Member States in particular, but it is not enough. As you said, Mr\u00a0Gorbach, the number of deaths in the Union is in danger of increasing to 32\u00a0500 in the year 2010 if we do not take it upon ourselves to give new impetus to this road safety policy. Greater efforts are necessary, and the disparities between the Member States must be rectified.\nThe Austrian Presidency has enabled us to make progress with an agreement on the European driving licence, for which I should like to express my gratitude once again. I would point out that this driving licence is accompanied by a licence for mopeds and a progressive licence for the most powerful motorcycles. That should enable us to reduce the number of motorcycle deaths, which is increasing at an alarming rate.\nOver and above this assessment and over and above the progress made during this Presidency, the Commission will present, in 2006, new initiatives to be included in the action plan that I will propose in the revised White Paper.\nFirstly, a proposal for a directive on the management of road safety in the trans-European network. It is not a question of us explaining how a road should be made safer, but of the European Union confirming, in each of the Member States, that a great deal of attention is paid to safety when a new road is built or an existing one is improved.\nSecondly, a proposal for a directive that will enable cross-border legal action to be taken in the most serious cases of a violation of the highway code: speeding, drink driving and driving without wearing a seat belt. It is not right that the perpetrator of a serious offence should escape punishment simply by crossing the border.\nFinally, as you said, Mr\u00a0Gorbach, we are going to close a loophole in the current legislation regarding the blind-spot mirrors fitted to existing heavy goods vehicles. We are also endeavouring to make progress with the idea of a third \u2018daytime\u2019 running light. Some Member States already want the opportunity to request this extra equipment for cars. Together with my colleague, Mr\u00a0Verheugen, we are now going to examine how this issue should be dealt with and what follow-up action should be taken in relation to the recommendations made by the CARS 21 group, which has listed a whole host of safety equipment that is likely to be very beneficial to the vehicles on Europe's roads.\nIn concluding this first point, I should like to confirm that our assessment of the progress made in the field of road safety will continue on an annual basis. Mr\u00a0Gorbach also mentioned the idea of a European Road Safety Day, as well as the launch of awareness campaigns, events that will all need to be carried out at European level. I can confirm to Parliament that we are working in conjunction with the Presidency on all of these matters.\nIf you will allow me, I am now going to address the issue of the security of modes of transport, including the difficult subject of how they are financed. I know that this issue worries the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission. Following the events of 11\u00a0September 2001, the Commission proposed a framework regulation designed to lay down common rules in the field of civil aviation security. The support of Parliament, together with that of the Council, was crucial to the successful conclusion of that legislative process. That regulation was accompanied by an interinstitutional declaration in which our three institutions reaffirmed their determination to enhance the quality of aviation security systems in the Community. Furthermore, it seemed necessary to prevent any distortion of internal and external competition.\nFinally, the three institutions noted the Commission\u2019s intention to commission a study concerning the way in which the financing of security is divided up between public authorities and operators. The Commission committed itself to submitting to the European Parliament and the Council the results and the proposals that would emerge from this study. A similar position was taken when the regulation on the improvement of ships and ports security was adopted in 2004. The regulation recognised that the actual, uniform application of security measures raised important questions, which were always linked to financing. In that respect, the Commission also had to embark upon a study with a view to sending information to the European Parliament and to examining any proposals that would be worth presenting.\nThe Commission put in place, from 2004, an inspection system that has helped significantly to enhance aviation security. To date, the Commission has carried out 69 inspections in all of the Member States. In the light of these inspections, the Commission proposed, at the end of 2005, the revision of Regulation 2320/2002, which is currently being looked into by the Committee on Transport and Tourism and for which you, Mr\u00a0Costa, are the rapporteur. Together with this proposal for a revision, the Commission presented the first annual report on the implementation of the regulation currently in force, as well as the main results of the inspections.\nFurthermore, I would highlight the fact that the regulatory committee created by the framework regulation of 2002 has worked hard and has made it possible for eight implementing regulations to be adopted. The Commission has also launched two crucial studies, which have confirmed the importance of the issue of financing.\nAs regards aviation, the study was brought to completion in 2004.

The user provided a parliamentary debate summary and wants the main points from Jacques Barrot's speech. First, I need to go through the debate summary carefully.\n\nLooking at the sections, there's a part under \"Road Safety Progress and Challenges\" where Jacques Barrot is mentioned. The summary says he acknowledged progress but confirmed it's inadequate. He noted the 2005 death toll and the 17.5% reduction over four years. Also, the Commission proposed measures like a directive on trans-European network safety and cross-border legal actions.\n\nThen, in the \"Commission Response and Timeline\" section, Barrot mentions recognizing the complexity of security financing but admits difficulty in finding a solution. He mentions the Commission's commitment to a report by summer on aviation and maritime security financing, and the principle that public authorities should take responsibility.\n\nNow, the user wants only the points attributed to Jacques Barrot. So I need to extract his statements. The issueSum should cover road safety and security financing. His position is that progress is made but not enough, and he's pushing for specific measures. The arguments would be the stats from 2005 and the need for directives. Proposals include the directive and cross-border actions. Also, in the Commission response, he talks about the report and public responsibility.\n\nWait, but the user's example response has specific sections. Let me structure it properly. IssueSum: Road safety targets and security financing. PositionSum: Acknowledged progress but inadequate, needs more measures. ArgSum: Cited 2005 data and the need for directives. PropSum: Proposed directives and cross-border legal actions, plus the report on security financing.\n\nI need to make sure not to include other speakers' points. For example, Gorbach's comments about the 2010 target are from him, not Barrot. So stick strictly to Barrot's contributions. Also, check if there's anything else about security financing from him. The Commission response section mentions Barrot's acknowledgment of complexity and the report timeline.

Thank you for what you have said, Vice-Chancellor, I agree with you. The heart of the matter is the simple question: how can we pay for security measures in aviation? This problem was raised with the Costa report. It is high time we discussed it. May I remind you that we as the European Parliament agreed in 2002 that the aviation security measures occasioned by terrorism should be paid for by the Member States. Counter-terrorism is a public function and paying for it is therefore also a public function. Then, because we were unable to agree, in the legislative process for the basic regulation in 2002 we settled for at least an interinstitutional agreement that the Commission should present a proposal for the public financing of such aviation security measures.\nMr Vice-President, you know how much I respect you, but I do not expect you to submit studies, I expect you to present a clear report with clear legislative proposals.

Since the attacks of 9/11, safety in the transport sector has become an important area of concern, for Europe as much as for anyone else, and with good reason. The port sector has been looked at, European legislation has changed safety at airports beyond all recognition, and I am glad to see that other measures are under way.\nIf we want to adopt sound safety policy, though, we should not only draft common safety guidelines which, needless to say, should apply everywhere in the same way, we must also be clear about who will be footing the bill for all of this. We need common European rules for this, along with a level playing field, therefore. We cannot have a situation where in one Member State, all of the costs are passed on to the passengers, while in another Member State, most of the costs are borne by the state. A regulation in this respect is all the more urgent, because the costs involved in new safety measures continue to spiral out of all proportion. Accordingly, since 2001, Brussels airport has doubled its safety supplement which it charges each of its passengers. We have now also started to draft fresh legislation.\nAs already stated, though, an interinstitutional declaration was drafted on this very topic as long ago as 2002. This was accompanied by the pledge that a solution for the problem of funding would be tabled shortly. The Commission promised to present a communication on a strategy to tackle this problem by the end of 2005. We are still waiting for this communication. A while ago, rumour had it that we could expect this by the end of April, which turned out incorrect. I would like to ask the Commissioner when we can expect this communication.\nIndeed, under these circumstances, it is difficult for us, as co-legislators, to do our jobs properly. We may be discussing the change to Regulation 2320, but we have no idea where we are headed in respect of an important component in the dossier.

Ik denk dat het thema van de verkeersveiligheid een apart debat verdient en dat we daar bij een andere gelegenheid zeker nog eens uitgebreid op willen ingaan.\nIk wil het alleen hebben over de problematiek van de financiering van de veiligheid. Sinds de aanslagen van 11 september is veiligheid in de transportsector terecht een belangrijk aandachtspunt geworden, ook op Europees niveau. De havensector is aan bod gekomen, de veiligheid van luchthavens onderging een ware metamorfose dankzij Europese wetgeving, en andere maatregelen zijn in voorbereiding en dat is goed.\nMaar, als we een goed veiligheidsbeleid willen voeren, dan moeten we niet alleen gemeenschappelijke veiligheidsrichtlijnen uitwerken die uiteraard overal op dezelfde manier moeten worden toegepast, maar moeten we ook klaarheid scheppen over wie dat allemaal gaat betalen. We hebben hiervoor gemeenschappelijke Europese regels nodig en dus ook gelijke concurrentievoorwaarden. Het kan niet zo zijn dat de kosten in de ene lidstaat volledig verhaald worden op de passagiers en in een andere lidstaat de overheid een groot deel op zich neemt. Een regeling terzake is des te dringender omdat de kosten die aan nieuwe veiligheidsmaatregelen verbonden zijn, op een spectaculaire manier blijven stijgen. Zo heeft de luchthaven van Brussel bijvoorbeeld de veiligheidstoeslag die zij aanrekent per passagier sinds 2001 verdubbeld. En ondertussen zijn we met nieuwe wetgeving bezig.\nNochtans - het is al gezegd - werd reeds in 2002 een interinstitutionele verklaring daarover gemaakt met de afspraak dat er snel een oplossing zou komen voor het probleem van de financiering. De Commissie beloofde tegen eind 2005 met een mededeling te komen over een strategie om dat probleem aan te pakken. Die mededeling hebben we nog niet gezien. Een tijdje geleden deed het gerucht de ronde dat we deze tegen eind april zouden mogen verwachten. Dit blijkt niet waar te zijn. Ik zou inderdaad willen vragen aan de commissaris wanneer we deze mededeling mogen verwachten.\nWant in deze omstandigheden is het moeilijk voor ons, als medewetgever, om ons werk goed te doen. We zijn inderdaad bezig met de bespreking van de wijziging van Verordening 2320 maar we hebben geen idee waar we naartoe gaan met betrekking tot een belangrijk element in het dossier.

It seems to me, however, that today\u2019s confusion cannot be ascribed purely to the linguistic factor.\nThese two subjects are too important to be tackled together. I must admit, however, that when it comes to the \u2018safety\u2019 aspect of the word, it is thanks to the contribution of Parliament that fundamental progress has been made with regard to driving time and driving licences.\nI would like to make just one point: the greatest contribution we could probably make to road safety would be to make less people use the roads. If we worked harder and faster on the third railway package, therefore, we would perhaps succeed in making a more significant contribution to safety than any of the other proposals that have been illustrated today.\nComing, though, to the \u2018security\u2019 sense of the word, and to its financing \u2013 which is a problem that concerns me directly, as rapporteur of this measure \u2013 I ask myself the following question: \u2018Can we proceed with amending the regulation in accordance with the standards that define security without answering the question our citizens are asking, namely who will pay for it?\u2019 This strikes me as the key point. It is rather difficult to answer \u2018yes\u2019, partly because we have also come to realise that security is a single issue, that there are not 25 types of security and that it is not possible for each Member State to establish its own security.\nIf, however, a single security exists for all countries, then we cannot do anything other than define standard, potentially uniform, measures, and establish in a clear, transparent way how to pay for it. There could then also be additional measures, which are more stringent and apply only in particular countries. Even in this case, though, how can we guarantee that these independent measures do not interfere negatively with, and have repercussions on, the security of the other countries?\nWhile we wait, reality moves on. What we have today is, in fact, a basic security financed through fares and extra ticket costs, and more or less cofinanced by the Member States according to the levels of security they wish to establish. This system must be regulated differently. I think that the Member States should at least pay for the surplus measures and that it is essential that there be clarity regarding the basic level of cofinance between operator or, better, user Member States.

Oggi abbiamo, di fatto, una sicurezza di base che \u00e8 finanziata per mezzo di tariffe, costi extra sui biglietti ed \u00e8 pi\u00f9 o meno cofinanziata dagli Stati membri a seconda dei livelli di sicurezza che essi intendono stabilire.

The tragic events in Madrid have given us cause to reflect that other traffic routes and modes of transport are faced with the same challenge. However, if we want fair competition between the different modes of transport, there must also be fair rules for the financing of security measures. Hence my question: when can we expect the study?

But it will also be particularly important that all projects and all measures are well organised. The proposed policy mix sounds sensible, but it will also cost money. In this connection, we must try to ensure that European money is used sensibly, appropriately and economically. It is of course also important that these scarce European resources ultimately end up with the people and do not drain away somewhere.\nWhen I say that, I am not at all thinking of embezzlement, fraud and the like, but am thinking of the fact that, in aviation in particular, most European airports and airport operators make a great deal of money.

Let me start by reading through the summary again to make sure I don't miss anything.\n\nThe user wants the main points or arguments made by Hubert Gorbach. The debate is about road safety and transport security financing. The summary mentions that Hubert Gorbach is representing the Austrian Presidency. \n\nLooking at the section on Road Safety Progress and Challenges, it says he highlighted that current projections show 32,500 fatalities instead of the target 25,000. He said Europe is on the right road but too slow. He also mentioned motorcycle fatalities increasing, which is a problem. Then, in the Transport Security Financing Controversy section, there's a part where he takes a stance on public vs. private financing. He says counter-terrorism is a public function, so paying for it is public responsibility. He demands clear legislative proposals instead of studies. Also, in the Positions on Public vs. Private Financing section, he states that counter-terrorism is a national function, and if it's passed to airlines, responsibility lies with passengers, which he disagrees with.\n\nSo the key points for Gorbach are about road safety targets not being met, specifically motorcycle deaths, and his position on public financing for security measures. His arguments are based on the need for legislative action and public responsibility. His proposals include clear legislative measures and ensuring security is a public function.\n\nI need to structure this into the JSON format as per the example. The issueSum should mention road safety targets and motorcycle fatalities. PositionSum would be his stance on public financing and legislative proposals. ArgSum would be the reasoning behind his position, like ensuring responsibility isn't shifted to passengers.

The summary says he acknowledged progress but confirmed it's inadequate. He noted the 2005 deaths figure and mentioned the Commission's proposed measures like a directive on trans-European network safety and cross-border legal actions.\n\nThen, in the \"Transport Security Financing Controversy\" section, Barrot is quoted again. He says the Commission recognizes the complexity of security financing and admits it's hard to find a solution that works for everyone. He also mentions the Commission's commitment to a report by summer on aviation and maritime security financing, supporting the idea that public authorities should take responsibility.\n\nSo, the key issues for Barrot are road safety progress and security financing. His positions are that progress is made but not enough, and that security financing is complex. The arguments are based on the need for EU-wide solutions and acknowledging the challenges. The proposals include the directive and cross-border actions, plus the report on security financing.\n\nI need to structure this into the JSON format. Make sure not to include other speakers' points.

However, the user's input says the speaker is \"President,\" so I should proceed with that.\n\nLooking at the debate summary, under the \"Road Safety Progress and Challenges\" section, Hubert Gorbach (Austrian Presidency) is mentioned. His points include the EU not meeting the 2010 road safety target, current projections showing 32,500 fatalities, and the increasing motorcycle fatalities. He also mentions that if the trend continues, motorcyclists will make up a third of deaths in 2010. \n\nBut the user's query says the speaker is \"President.\" If the actual speaker is Hubert Gorbach, but the user refers to him as \"President,\" maybe that's a mistake.

He also mentions that Europe is on the right road but too slow. However, in the \"Transport Security Financing Controversy\" section, Gorbach's position is about counter-terrorism being a public function, stating that it's a national function and responsibility shouldn't lie with passengers. \n\nWait, the user's example response includes issueSum, positionSum, argSum, propSum.

But in the debate summary, the \"President\" (assuming Gorbach) is mentioned in two parts: road safety and security financing. \n\nSo, the key issues would be road safety targets and the financing of security measures. His position is that counter-terrorism is a public function, so it's a national responsibility. The arguments would be that passing it to airlines would shift responsibility to passengers, which he disagrees with. His proposals would be that public authorities should handle security measures, and he supports clear legislative proposals.\n\nBut I need to make sure I'm only including what's attributed to the speaker. The user's example has the speaker's name as \"President,\" but in the summary, the speaker is Hubert Gorbach. However, the user might have a typo. Since the user's instruction says to use the speaker name given, even if it's \"President,\" I need to check if there's any mention of \"President\" in the debate summary. \n\nLooking back, the debate summary mentions \"Austrian Presidency\" and \"Hubert Gorbach, representing the Austrian Presidency.\" There's no mention of a \"President\" as a speaker. So maybe the user made a mistake in the speaker's name. However, the user's query says the speaker is \"President,\" so perhaps they meant the Austrian Presidency. But in the debate, the Austrian Presidency is represented by Gorbach. \n\nIn that case, maybe the user intended to refer to Gorbach as the \"President,\" but the correct name is Hubert Gorbach. However, the user's instruction says to use the speaker name as given. If there's no \"President\" in the debate summary, then the answer would be an empty string. But the user might have intended \"President\" to refer to Gorbach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is referring to the European Commission President, but in the summary, the Commission is represented by Jacques Barrot. The user's query says \"Speaker Name: President,\" which might be a mistake. But given the information, I need to check if the speaker \"President\" is mentioned. \n\nSince the debate summary doesn't mention a \"President\" as a speaker, but the Austrian Presidency is represented by Gorbach, perhaps the user intended that. However, the user's instruction says to only include points attributed to the speaker. If the speaker is \"President\" and there's no such speaker in the debate, then the answer would be empty. But the user might have made a mistake. \n\nIn this case, I'll proceed under the assumption that \"President\" refers to Hubert Gorbach, the Austrian Presidency representative. So, the issues he raised are road safety targets and security financing. His positions are about counter-terrorism being a public function, and the need for clear legislation. The arguments are about shifting responsibility to passengers and the need for public funding. Proposals include public authorities taking responsibility and legislative measures.\n\nSo, structuring the JSON with those points.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The key issues raised by the speaker relate to road safety targets and the financing of transport security measures.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"The speaker emphasized that counter-terrorism and transport security are public responsibilities, not to be shifted onto passengers or private entities.\",\n\"argSum\": \"The speaker argued that passing responsibility for security measures to airlines or operators would unfairly place the burden on passengers, and that public authorities must bear the cost of security measures implemented after 9/11.\",\n\"propSum\": \"The speaker advocated for clear legislative proposals to ensure that public authorities, not passengers or private entities, fund and manage transport security measures.\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}]
