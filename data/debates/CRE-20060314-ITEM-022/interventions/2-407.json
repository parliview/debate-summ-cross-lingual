{"speaker": "Elspeth Attwooll,", "english": "Elspeth Attwooll, on behalf of the ALDE Group . \u2013 Mr President, the ALDE Group congratulates Mr \u00d3 Neachtain on his report. It is clear and succinct and yet comprehensive in its coverage of the issues. We particularly endorse the references to biodiversity and to the need for action in relation both to ghost fishing and discards, as well as the call for the Commission to continue to promote the adoption of an FAO International Plan of Action on bycatch reduction.\nOn ghost fishing, we stressed the importance of monitoring the existing transitional measure, to ensure that it is not simply leading to displacement of effort, and the importance of the full involvement of the European Parliament in discussions relating to long-term controls. We entirely agree with the report\u2019s emphasis on the role that regional advisory councils can play in the promotion of environmentally friendly fishing methods and with the necessity of affording them increased technical and financial support.\nWe regret that we cannot vote for either of the amendments. Whilst we sympathise with the approach expressed in Amendment 1, particularly on decentralisation and co-management, we have difficulties with some of the wording and feel that the points are effectively addressed in paragraph 19. In the same way we believe that the issue of compensation, as raised in Amendment 2, is already adequately covered by the existing paragraph 6.\nIn conclusion, we commend the report to the Commission, the Council and Parliament as a whole.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Elspeth Attwooll, on behalf of the ALDE Group . \u2013 Mr President, the ALDE Group congratulates Mr \u00d3 Neachtain on his report.
