(EL) Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur and to add that, despite the actions taken by the European Union, fish stocks are under constant threat and that this is due to three very important factors: firstly intensive rates of fishing, secondly fishing methods and thirdly maritime pollution.\nThe Committee on Fisheries adopted a report in January, the purpose of which is to promote environmentally-friendly fishing methods by proposing various technical measures, such as the definition of fishing areas, fishing periods and fishing tools.\nWe all wish for and are seeking sustainable exploitation of the seas and that is why we all need to move in this direction. As part of this effort, I too should like to emphasise certain things:\nFirstly, the measures applied must be based on adequate, substantiated scientific studies, taking account of the peculiarities of each area.\nSecondly, fishing organisations must have a right of participation, opinion and codecision in the overall procedure. In this way fishermen, realising the importance of and the need for the measures, will contribute to their more effective application.\nThirdly, more environmentally-friendly fishing methods imply less and more selective fishing, new equipment and loss of income. It is therefore important to make provision for adequate resources to support efforts.\nFourthly, it is very important that stricter measures be taken to protect seas from contamination either from land or sea and\nFifthly, seas know no borders. The European Union must find ways of ensuring that measures to protect the seas are applied not only by the Member States, but also by third countries.\nTo close, I wish to emphasise that it is the sacred duty of the entire world to leave clean seas with fish in them to future generations.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Ioannis Gklavakis (PPE-DE).
