I cannot agree more with what the rapporteur has just said regarding the honesty and integrity of fishermen; the abuses of the few should not be blamed on everyone at large and we need to clamp down strongly on the real culprits.\nThe Commission attaches great importance to the development of more environmentally friendly fishing methods. Improving selectivity is one of the objectives of the technical measures that we propose in that context. In that regard, I am pleased to note that some progress has been achieved on the technical measures in the Baltic that were adopted by the Council in December, and the Commission intends to increase selectivity and the new technical measures to be proposed for the Mediterranean Sea, the Atlantic and North Sea.\nI have noted your interest in combating ghost fishing. The Commission is prepared to be at the forefront of this battle. Following the Deepnet report, measures were decided, in the last TAC and in the quota regulation for 2006, to ban temporarily deepwater gillnet fishery in the areas covered by the report and concerned by this activity until such time as permanent measures \u2013 also applicable to other areas, in lieu of a complete ban \u2013 are adopted, hopefully, during this year. I have also reserved funds to support retrieval surveys of ghost nets. The Commission will continue to follow these issues with particular attention.\nThe reduction of discards will be a major objective of the new technical measures for the Atlantic and the North Sea. It needs to be underscored that, due to the variety of the catch composition and the level of discards in European Union waters, the regional aspects of the different fisheries will be taken into account. The various areas to be considered will correspond to the spheres of influence of the different RACs, thereby incorporating more easily the proposals made by those councils, a positive evaluation being made by the relevant RAC.\nThe Commission is encouraging the industry to engage in pilot programmes by making use of the RACs for this purpose. Two such pilot projects have already been carried out in France and Sweden. Further pilot projects, in full cooperation with the industry, will allow us to test on a case-by-case basis possible measures to reduce discards effectively.\nThe Commission is also encouraging the development of efforts in fisheries management in the Kattegat in cooperation with Denmark, Sweden and Germany. This will hopefully lead to positive results later this year. This kind of management, among other objectives, is aimed at reducing or eliminating discards.\nBycatch reduction is linked to selectivity and discard issues and, at international level, the Commission has promoted a global approach for bycatch issues within the FAO. This could result in an international plan of action on bycatch reduction and/or technical guidelines elaborated by the FAO.\nMost of the measures to promote environmentally friendly fishing methods will be included in the new technical measures for the Atlantic and the North Sea. As you know, technical measures are considered as a complement to effort limitations, TACs and quotas, long-term management and recovery plans, and as part of the overall package of management measures.\nI have noted your request to simplify the regulatory system and can inform you that these new technical measures will be a fundamental test case in the simplification programme led by the Commission. They are one of the principal points of the action plan on simplification.\nTurning to the amendments: with regard to Amendment 1 on centralisation and co-management, the Commission would like to see substantial RAC involvement in the elaboration of technical measures without, however, any change to the decision-making process. The Commission agrees with taking into account initiatives of RACs so as to improve fisheries management and can accept that point on condition that the positive effects of such measures are confirmed by scientific assessment. I would like to emphasise that we already have examples to illustrate that the Commission takes into account proposals from the RACs, such as the case of the French square-meshed panel, the Swedish grid and the proposed new rule under which \u2013 for safety reasons \u2013 the cod line is to be placed as far as ten metres, instead of one metre, away from the meshes of the cod end when using an onboard pump system in pelagic fisheries.\nIt is premature to give a definitive reaction to Amendment 2, since discussions on depleted fish stocks are still under way.

Following the Deepnet report, measures were decided, in the last TAC and in the quota regulation for 2006, to ban temporarily deepwater gillnet fishery in the areas covered by the report and concerned by this activity until such time as permanent measures \u2013 also applicable to other areas, in lieu of a complete ban \u2013 are adopted, hopefully, during this year. I have also reserved funds to support retrieval surveys of ghost nets. The Commission will continue to follow these issues with particular attention.\nThe reduction of discards will be a major objective of the new technical measures for the Atlantic and the North Sea. It needs to be underscored that, due to the variety of the catch composition and the level of discards in European Union waters, the regional aspects of the different fisheries will be taken into account. The various areas to be considered will correspond to the spheres of influence of the different RACs, thereby incorporating more easily the proposals made by those councils, a positive evaluation being made by the relevant RAC.\nThe Commission is encouraging the industry to engage in pilot programmes by making use of the RACs for this purpose. Two such pilot projects have already been carried out in France and Sweden. Further pilot projects, in full cooperation with the industry, will allow us to test on a case-by-case basis possible measures to reduce discards effectively.\nThe Commission is also encouraging the development of efforts in fisheries management in the Kattegat in cooperation with Denmark, Sweden and Germany. This will hopefully lead to positive results later this year. This kind of management, among other objectives, is aimed at reducing or eliminating discards.\nBycatch reduction is linked to selectivity and discard issues and, at international level, the Commission has promoted a global approach for bycatch issues within the FAO. This could result in an international plan of action on bycatch reduction and/or technical guidelines elaborated by the FAO.\nMost of the measures to promote environmentally friendly fishing methods will be included in the new technical measures for the Atlantic and the North Sea. As you know, technical measures are considered as a complement to effort limitations, TACs and quotas, long-term management and recovery plans, and as part of the overall package of management measures.\nI have noted your request to simplify the regulatory system and can inform you that these new technical measures will be a fundamental test case in the simplification programme led by the Commission. They are one of the principal points of the action plan on simplification.\nTurning to the amendments: with regard to Amendment 1 on centralisation and co-management, the Commission would like to see substantial RAC involvement in the elaboration of technical measures without, however, any change to the decision-making process. The Commission agrees with taking into account initiatives of RACs so as to improve fisheries management and can accept that point on condition that the positive effects of such measures are confirmed by scientific assessment. I would like to emphasise that we already have examples to illustrate that the Commission takes into account proposals from the RACs, such as the case of the French square-meshed panel, the Swedish grid and the proposed new rule under which \u2013 for safety reasons \u2013 the cod line is to be placed as far as ten metres, instead of one metre, away from the meshes of the cod end when using an onboard pump system in pelagic fisheries.\nIt is premature to give a definitive reaction to Amendment 2, since discussions on depleted fish stocks are still under way. They will hopefully be concluded by April. However, the draft proposal from the Commission already provides for socio-economic compensation linked to recovery plans, and I can assure you that this topic will be given the necessary attention.", "reconstructed_position": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out what Joe Borg's main points were in the debate.

Also, he mentioned addressing over-capacity and fishing effort as root causes of stock depletion.\n\nSo, Joe Borg's arguments are about technical measures, regional cooperation, tackling over-capacity, and fishing effort. The key points are the Commission's focus on technical measures, regional cooperation, and the need to address over-capacity and fishing effort. I need to make sure I don't include anything from other speakers like the rapporteur or others. Just Joe Borg's points. Let me check again to confirm there's nothing else attributed to him.

Our group is satisfied with the report and we also support the two amendments tabled. The report is very timely. Last month, it became public knowledge that a number of deep-sea fish are threatened with exhaustion and even extinction. There are no two ways about it: the fish stocks are in a desperate fix and a change of tack towards sustainable and environmentally-friendly fisheries is desperately needed, and affects us all.\nLet me begin by saying that fishermen will need to adjust to the depletion of fish stocks. While there is a need for technical measures, such as acoustic deterring devices, electric impulses which will render the disturbance of the sea bed unnecessary, adequate mesh sizes and fish hooks in order to minimise bycatch, non-technical measures are at least equally important. I am mainly concerned about preventing illegal fishing and introducing marine reserves so as to replenish fish populations.\nThis sounds simple, but it is an unfortunate fact that it is not. Our group stresses the need for fishermen to be encouraged to apply sustainable methods. The fisheries sector is having a tough time, not least due to increasing oil prices. In this light, we need an active and involved government in order to promote sustainable fishing. The governments must also stand surety for control and enforcement. Illegal fishing renders the situation impossible for all parties. Without effective control measures, this situation will irrevocably lead to a tragedy of common sense. Everyone stands to lose and soon there will be no fish left to catch.\nThirdly, consumers must also be involved in sustainable fishing. Many consumers wish to buy well-caught fish, but they do not know which of the fish is sustainable. Certification and quality marks are therefore important. Sustainable fish is, first and foremost, fish that is not overfished, without unnecessary bycatch and discards, and good information to consumers is needed in this respect. Only then will consumers take an informed decision in favour of sustainably caught fish.\nFinally, in order to make a change of tack possible, we as politicians must shoulder our responsibility. We must constantly draw the attention to sustainable fishing and we must act; we must respond to the fishermen who make the temporary introduction of marine reserves possible, thus ensuring that they do not lose their incomes in the short term. The report that is before us constitutes a few sound steps in that direction and these must be fleshed out in the near future. Needless to say, the fishing industry must be involved in the measures. Only with responsible politicians and active government, innovative fishermen and involved consumers can both the fishing industry and the fish look forward to a sustainable future.", "lang": "NL", "original": "Dorette Corbey, namens de PSE-Fractie . \u2013 Voorzitter, commissaris, collega's, allereerst mijn complimenten voor het uitstekende verslag van collega \u00d3 Neachtain. Onze fractie is ingenomen met het verslag en wij steunen ook de twee amendementen die nog ingebracht zijn. Het verslag komt op een belangrijk moment. Vorige maand werd bekend dat een aantal diepzeevissen met uitputting en zelfs uitsterving bedreigd worden. We kunnen er niet meer onderuit, het gaat slecht met de visstanden en koersverandering in de richting van een duurzame en milieuvriendelijke visserij is hard nodig en die verandering treft ons allemaal.\nLaat ik beginnen bij de vissers, zij zullen zich moeten aanpassen aan het feit dat visbestanden uitgeput raken. Technische maatregelen zijn nodig, zoals akoestische afschrikmiddelen, elektrische impulsen om bodemberoering overbodig te maken, adequate mazen en vishaken om bijvangst te minimaliseren, maar de niet-technische maatregelen zijn minstens even belangrijk. Daarbij denk ik in de eerste plaats aan het voorkomen van illegale visvangst en het instellen van visreservaten. Vispopulaties krijgen zo weer de kans om te groeien.\nHet klinkt eenvoudig, maar dat is het helaas niet. Onze fractie benadrukt dat vissers in staat gesteld moeten worden, duurzame methoden toe te passen. De visserijsector heeft het niet gemakkelijk, alleen al vanwege de stijgende olieprijzen. Daarmee is een actieve en betrokken overheid noodzakelijk om duurzame visserij te bevorderen. De overheden moeten daarnaast garant staan voor controle en handhaving. Illegale visserij maakt de situatie onmogelijk voor alle partijen. Zonder effectieve controle leidt dit onherroepelijk tot een tragedy of the common sense. Iedereen verliest en er is straks geen vis meer over.\nTen derde moet ook de consument betrokken worden bij duurzame visserij. Veel consumenten willen goed gevangen vis kopen, maar ze weten niet welke vis duurzaam is. Certificering en keurmerken zijn daarom belangrijk. Duurzame vis is allereerst vis die niet wordt overbevist zonder onnodige bijvangst en teruggooi, en goede voorlichting aan consumenten is daarbij nodig. Alleen dan zal de consument ook weloverwogen kiezen voor duurzaam gevangen vis.\nTen slotte, om een koersverandering mogelijk te maken, moeten we ook als politici verantwoordelijkheid nemen. We moeten voortdurend de aandacht vragen voor duurzame visserij en we moeten handelen; we moeten een antwoord geven aan die vissers die de instelling van visreservaten tijdelijk mogelijk maken, zodat ze tijdelijk niet hun inkomens verliezen. Het verslag dat voor ons ligt zijn een aantal goede stappen in die richting en deze moeten vorm krijgen in de nabije toekomst. De visserijsector moet natuurlijk bij de maatregelen betrokken worden. Alleen met verantwoordelijke politici en actieve overheid, innovatieve vissers en betrokken consumenten hebben zowel de visserijsector als de vis een duurzame toekomst.", "agenda_item": "More environmentally friendly fishing methods (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060314-ITEM-022", "intervention_id": "2-406", "summary_english": "{\n\"headline\": \"Urgent Need for Sustainable Fishing with Government Support, Consumer Involvement, and Marine Reserves to Prevent Fish Stock Collapse\",\n\"issueSum\": \"The speaker highlights the critical depletion of fish stocks, with deep-sea fish threatened with exhaustion and extinction.

The user wants me to outline the main points or arguments made by Ian Hudghton based on the provided debate summary. First, I need to locate any mentions of Ian Hudghton in the summary.\n\nLooking through the document, under the \"Positions and Arguments\" section, there's a mention of Ian Hudghton (Verts/ALE). The key point he made is criticizing the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) itself, stating that it's not environmentally friendly. His exact quote is: \"The CFP itself, I would contend, is not environmentally friendly: TACs and quotas measure not the amount of fish caught but only the fish landed.\" \n\nSo, the main argument here is that the CFP's current approach, which uses Total Allowable Catches (TACs) and quotas, is flawed because they only track landed fish, not the total caught. This means that practices like discards (throwing back fish) aren't accounted for, leading to environmental issues. Hudghton is advocating for a change in the CFP to address this systemic problem.\n\nI need to make sure there are no other points attributed to him. The rest of the summary mentions other speakers, but for Ian Hudghton, only this specific argument is noted. The user's instruction says to only include points from the specified speaker, so I shouldn't add anything else. \n\nTherefore, the response should clearly state that Ian Hudghton criticized the CFP for not being environmentally friendly, pointing out the flaw in TACs and quotas only measuring landed fish instead of total catches.

This sustainability should also be based on technical measures arising from scientific fishing research, in particular via the implementation of closed seasons, prohibited zones and mesh size regulations.\nThat being said, we feel that fisheries management policies should not be used to penalise this strategically valuable activity, which is of vital economic and social importance. It is therefore necessary to strike a balance between meeting social and economic needs and environmental sustainability, in particular by implementing appropriate social and economic measures to compensate fishermen for the costs of reducing their activities connected with plans to rebuild depleted stocks, especially those working in less well-developed areas. Given that the common fisheries policy is a common policy, we believe that those taking decisions in this field need to take responsibility for those decisions.

I feel that in this and other areas, and using other instruments, we need to find solutions to the problems that we are facing, and that, accordingly, this debate today is of vital importance.\nIn the autonomous region of the Azores, considerable progress has been made in recent years, not least the prohibition of bottom gillnets and bottom trawls.

Secondly, we must prioritise the problem of discards, as the rapporteur has done.\nWe know that there are other countries within and outside Europe that operate a ban on any discard and I see no reason why we should not act more quickly and follow suit in the EU.\nThere is also the crucial problem of satellite systems for monitoring and detecting vessels, on which there is much to do if they are to comply fully.

As part of this effort, I too should like to emphasise certain things:\nFirstly, the measures applied must be based on adequate, substantiated scientific studies, taking account of the peculiarities of each area.\nSecondly, fishing organisations must have a right of participation, opinion and codecision in the overall procedure.

The summary mentions Gklavakis in two places. The first is about stakeholder involvement, emphasizing the need for fishing organizations to have participation rights. The second is a concluding statement about the duty to preserve seas for future generations. \n\nI need to check if there are any other mentions. The \"Positions and Arguments\" section mentions other speakers like \u00d3 Neachtain, Borg, Stevenson, Corbey, Hudghton, but not Gklavakis. In the \"Areas of Consensus and Disagreement\" section, there's no mention of Gklavakis. \n\nSo the two points are: 1) Advocating for fishing organizations' participation in decision-making, and 2) Emphasizing the duty to preserve marine environments. The user wants only the arguments from Gklavakis. The conclusion quote is a bit more of a general statement, but since it's attributed to him, it should be included. \n\nI need to present these points clearly, ensuring not to include anything from other speakers.

The user provided a debate summary and asked for the main points of the speaker named \"President.\" First, I need to check the debate summary to see if the President is mentioned.\n\nLooking through the sections, the debate information mentions 17 contributions from MEPs and the European Commission. The key sections are the positions and arguments, key proposals, and areas of consensus. The speakers listed here include Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Neachtain, Joe Borg, Struan Stevenson, Dorette Corbey, Ian Hudghton, Gklavakis, Pedro Guerreiro, and others. \n\nWait, the President isn't listed among the contributors. The European Commission's representative is Joe Borg, but the President of the European Commission at the time was Jos\u00e9 Barroso. However, the summary doesn't mention the President specifically. The user might be referring to the President of the European Commission or the President of the Parliament. But in the given debate summary, there's no mention of the President making a contribution. \n\nThe user's instruction says to only include points attributed to the specified speaker. Since the President isn't mentioned in the contributions, the answer should be an empty string. I need to confirm that there's no reference to the President in any part of the summary. Scanning through again, the contributions are from specific individuals and the Commission, but no President. Therefore, the correct response is an empty string.\n</think>\n\n\"\"\n\nThe debate summary provided does not attribute any contributions or arguments to a \"President\" (likely referring to the President of the European Commission or Parliament).
