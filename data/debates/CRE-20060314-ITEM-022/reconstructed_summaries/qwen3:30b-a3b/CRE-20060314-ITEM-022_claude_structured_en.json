The various areas to be considered will correspond to the spheres of influence of the different RACs, thereby incorporating more easily the proposals made by those councils, a positive evaluation being made by the relevant RAC.\nThe Commission is encouraging the industry to engage in pilot programmes by making use of the RACs for this purpose. Two such pilot projects have already been carried out in France and Sweden. Further pilot projects, in full cooperation with the industry, will allow us to test on a case-by-case basis possible measures to reduce discards effectively.\nThe Commission is also encouraging the development of efforts in fisheries management in the Kattegat in cooperation with Denmark, Sweden and Germany. This will hopefully lead to positive results later this year. This kind of management, among other objectives, is aimed at reducing or eliminating discards.\nBycatch reduction is linked to selectivity and discard issues and, at international level, the Commission has promoted a global approach for bycatch issues within the FAO. This could result in an international plan of action on bycatch reduction and/or technical guidelines elaborated by the FAO.\nMost of the measures to promote environmentally friendly fishing methods will be included in the new technical measures for the Atlantic and the North Sea.

Our group is satisfied with the report and we also support the two amendments tabled. The report is very timely. Last month, it became public knowledge that a number of deep-sea fish are threatened with exhaustion and even extinction. There are no two ways about it: the fish stocks are in a desperate fix and a change of tack towards sustainable and environmentally-friendly fisheries is desperately needed, and affects us all.\nLet me begin by saying that fishermen will need to adjust to the depletion of fish stocks. While there is a need for technical measures, such as acoustic deterring devices, electric impulses which will render the disturbance of the sea bed unnecessary, adequate mesh sizes and fish hooks in order to minimise bycatch, non-technical measures are at least equally important. I am mainly concerned about preventing illegal fishing and introducing marine reserves so as to replenish fish populations.\nThis sounds simple, but it is an unfortunate fact that it is not. Our group stresses the need for fishermen to be encouraged to apply sustainable methods. The fisheries sector is having a tough time, not least due to increasing oil prices. In this light, we need an active and involved government in order to promote sustainable fishing. The governments must also stand surety for control and enforcement. Illegal fishing renders the situation impossible for all parties. Without effective control measures, this situation will irrevocably lead to a tragedy of common sense. Everyone stands to lose and soon there will be no fish left to catch.\nThirdly, consumers must also be involved in sustainable fishing. Many consumers wish to buy well-caught fish, but they do not know which of the fish is sustainable. Certification and quality marks are therefore important. Sustainable fish is, first and foremost, fish that is not overfished, without unnecessary bycatch and discards, and good information to consumers is needed in this respect. Only then will consumers take an informed decision in favour of sustainably caught fish.\nFinally, in order to make a change of tack possible, we as politicians must shoulder our responsibility. We must constantly draw the attention to sustainable fishing and we must act; we must respond to the fishermen who make the temporary introduction of marine reserves possible, thus ensuring that they do not lose their incomes in the short term. The report that is before us constitutes a few sound steps in that direction and these must be fleshed out in the near future. Needless to say, the fishing industry must be involved in the measures. Only with responsible politicians and active government, innovative fishermen and involved consumers can both the fishing industry and the fish look forward to a sustainable future.", "lang": "NL", "original": "Dorette Corbey, namens de PSE-Fractie . \u2013 Voorzitter, commissaris, collega's, allereerst mijn complimenten voor het uitstekende verslag van collega \u00d3 Neachtain. Onze fractie is ingenomen met het verslag en wij steunen ook de twee amendementen die nog ingebracht zijn. Het verslag komt op een belangrijk moment. Vorige maand werd bekend dat een aantal diepzeevissen met uitputting en zelfs uitsterving bedreigd worden. We kunnen er niet meer onderuit, het gaat slecht met de visstanden en koersverandering in de richting van een duurzame en milieuvriendelijke visserij is hard nodig en die verandering treft ons allemaal.\nLaat ik beginnen bij de vissers, zij zullen zich moeten aanpassen aan het feit dat visbestanden uitgeput raken. Technische maatregelen zijn nodig, zoals akoestische afschrikmiddelen, elektrische impulsen om bodemberoering overbodig te maken, adequate mazen en vishaken om bijvangst te minimaliseren, maar de niet-technische maatregelen zijn minstens even belangrijk. Daarbij denk ik in de eerste plaats aan het voorkomen van illegale visvangst en het instellen van visreservaten. Vispopulaties krijgen zo weer de kans om te groeien.\nHet klinkt eenvoudig, maar dat is het helaas niet. Onze fractie benadrukt dat vissers in staat gesteld moeten worden, duurzame methoden toe te passen. De visserijsector heeft het niet gemakkelijk, alleen al vanwege de stijgende olieprijzen. Daarmee is een actieve en betrokken overheid noodzakelijk om duurzame visserij te bevorderen. De overheden moeten daarnaast garant staan voor controle en handhaving. Illegale visserij maakt de situatie onmogelijk voor alle partijen. Zonder effectieve controle leidt dit onherroepelijk tot een tragedy of the common sense. Iedereen verliest en er is straks geen vis meer over.\nTen derde moet ook de consument betrokken worden bij duurzame visserij. Veel consumenten willen goed gevangen vis kopen, maar ze weten niet welke vis duurzaam is. Certificering en keurmerken zijn daarom belangrijk. Duurzame vis is allereerst vis die niet wordt overbevist zonder onnodige bijvangst en teruggooi, en goede voorlichting aan consumenten is daarbij nodig. Alleen dan zal de consument ook weloverwogen kiezen voor duurzaam gevangen vis.\nTen slotte, om een koersverandering mogelijk te maken, moeten we ook als politici verantwoordelijkheid nemen. We moeten voortdurend de aandacht vragen voor duurzame visserij en we moeten handelen; we moeten een antwoord geven aan die vissers die de instelling van visreservaten tijdelijk mogelijk maken, zodat ze tijdelijk niet hun inkomens verliezen. Het verslag dat voor ons ligt zijn een aantal goede stappen in die richting en deze moeten vorm krijgen in de nabije toekomst. De visserijsector moet natuurlijk bij de maatregelen betrokken worden. Alleen met verantwoordelijke politici en actieve overheid, innovatieve vissers en betrokken consumenten hebben zowel de visserijsector als de vis een duurzame toekomst.", "agenda_item": "More environmentally friendly fishing methods (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060314-ITEM-022", "intervention_id": "2-406", "summary_english": "{\n\"headline\": \"Urgent Need for Sustainable Fishing with Government Support, Consumer Involvement, and Marine Reserves to Prevent Fish Stock Collapse\",\n\"issueSum\": \"The speaker highlights the critical depletion of fish stocks, with deep-sea fish threatened with exhaustion and extinction.

The user provided a parliamentary debate summary about environmentally friendly fishing methods and wants the main points from Ian Hudghton's speech.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the debate summary and find any mentions of Ian Hudghton. Scanning through the \"Positions and Arguments\" section, there's a part where Ian Hudghton is mentioned. The key quote is: \"The CFP itself, I would contend, is not environmentally friendly: TACs and quotas measure not the amount of fish caught but only the fish landed. Discards are caused by the CFP, rather than prevented by it.\" He also mentions Scottish opposition with 250,000 signatures calling for withdrawal from the CFP.\n\nSo, the issue here is the effectiveness of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) in promoting environmental sustainability. His position is that the CFP is flawed because it leads to discards instead of preventing them. The argument is that the current TACs and quotas don't address the problem of discards. The proposal isn't explicitly stated, but his position implies a need for reform or withdrawal from the CFP. However, the user's example response includes \"propSum\" even if the proposal isn't directly mentioned. Wait, in the example, the user's response includes a propSum even if the proposal isn't there. But in the debate summary, Ian Hudghton's main point is criticizing the CFP and mentioning the signatures, which could be seen as a proposal to withdraw. But the user's instruction says to only include points attributed to the speaker. So, the propSum would be the call for withdrawal from the CFP, as per the 250,000 signatures. But the actual proposal is the withdrawal, so that's the propSum.\n\nNow, structuring the JSON. The issueSum should mention the CFP's role in discards. PositionSum is that he argues the CFP isn't environmentally friendly. ArgSum is based on TACs and quotas only measuring landed fish, leading to discards. PropSum is the call for withdrawal from the CFP, as per the signatures.\n\nNeed to make sure not to include other speakers' points. Check if there's anything else about Ian Hudghton. The summary says he presented the strongest criticism, so the key points are the CFP's flaws and the need for withdrawal.

This sustainability should also be based on technical measures arising from scientific fishing research, in particular via the implementation of closed seasons, prohibited zones and mesh size regulations.\nThat being said, we feel that fisheries management policies should not be used to penalise this strategically valuable activity, which is of vital economic and social importance. It is therefore necessary to strike a balance between meeting social and economic needs and environmental sustainability, in particular by implementing appropriate social and economic measures to compensate fishermen for the costs of reducing their activities connected with plans to rebuild depleted stocks, especially those working in less well-developed areas. Given that the common fisheries policy is a common policy, we believe that those taking decisions in this field need to take responsibility for those decisions. Consequently, we have retabled an amendment calling on the Commission to propose social and economic compensation measures aimed at providing Community funding for plans to rebuild depleted fish stocks.\nSimilarly, as we believe that fishermen and their representative associations should be involved in determining measures to protect the marine environment and rebuild fish stocks, we have retabled an amendment stating that decentralisation and co-management are two principles that are fundamental both in guaranteeing the involvement of fishermen and their representative associations in measures to protect the marine environment and rebuild fish stocks, but also in guaranteeing the effectiveness of such measures, bearing in mind that it is the fishermen and their associations, who have first-hand knowledge of the state of resources and who are most concerned to ensure their preservation, who will be applying such measures.", "lang": "PT", "original": "Pedro Guerreiro, em nome do Grupo GUE/NGL . \u2013 Em primeiro lugar, gostaria de saudar o relator pela abertura e esfor\u00e7o de s\u00edntese que demonstrou na elabora\u00e7\u00e3o do seu relat\u00f3rio, que na generalidade acompanh\u00e1mos e que foi aprovado por unanimidade pela Comiss\u00e3o das Pescas.\nSem d\u00favida que a sustentabilidade dos recursos hali\u00eauticos \u00e9 fundamental para garantir a longo prazo a actividade piscat\u00f3ria e a viabilidade do sector das pescas.\nA sustentabilidade dos recursos que deve basear-se numa abordagem abrangente quanto \u00e0s medidas de protec\u00e7\u00e3o do meio marinho e de recupera\u00e7\u00e3o das unidades populacionais de pescado, dever\u00e1 igualmente considerar factores como a polui\u00e7\u00e3o costeira e de alto mar, os afluentes industriais e agr\u00edcolas, a dragagem de fundos e o transporte mar\u00edtimo.

The user provided a debate summary about environmentally friendly fishing methods and wants the main points from Kathy Sinnott's speech. First, I need to go through the debate summary and find any mentions of Kathy Sinnott.\n\nLooking at the \"Key Proposals\" section, there's a part about Kathy Sinnott. She proposed specific technical improvements: a minimum mesh size of 90 millimeters to protect nursery areas and reduce discards. She also called for restrictions on fishing gear length and measures against net stripping and dumping at sea. \n\nThe user's instructions say to only include points attributed to the speaker. So I need to make sure these are the only points. The other sections mention other speakers, like Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Neachtain or Joe Borg, but not Kathy Sinnott. \n\nNow, structuring the JSON. The issueSum should mention the key issue she addressed, which is reducing discards and protecting fish stocks. Her position is supporting technical measures. The arguments would be about protecting nursery areas and reducing waste. The proposals are the specific technical changes she mentioned. \n\nWait, the example response has \"issueSum\" as the key issue, \"positionSum\" as her stance, \"argSum\" as the reasoning, and \"propSum\" as the proposals. So for Kathy Sinnott, the issue is fish stock depletion and discards. Her position is in favor of technical measures. The argument is that these measures protect nursery areas and reduce discards. The proposal is the specific mesh size and gear restrictions. \n\nI need to make sure not to include anything else from other speakers. The user said to ignore other contributions.

I also wish to say that I wholeheartedly welcome the Commission's initiative in issuing a communication on promoting more environmentally-friendly fishing methods.\nThe technical conservation measures have a more important role than ever in the future of the sector. It is crucial that we adopt methods to improve selectivity and, therefore, the possibility of catching fish at the right size, taking account of biology and the life cycle of each individual species.\nThe satisfactory reproduction of fish, and in turn increased stocks, will only be possible if there are appropriate management measures, such as the temporary closure of certain fishing areas, to reduce bycatch to sustainable levels, and the effective practice of monitoring of vessels and fishing areas by means of satellite technology.\nIt is also necessary to become aware of the specific characteristics of fishing practices in the various Member States. This knowledge will help to implement appropriate, well-balanced measures that will ensure the recovery and management of fish sources and safeguard the overriding interests of fishermen and vessel owners. It is accordingly necessary to adopt a decentralised approach taking account of the specific characteristics of fishing areas and different species.\nIn spite of the Commission\u2019s good intentions, a more decentralised approach is sometimes needed on important and sensitive questions regarding the economic and environmental sustainability of fisheries. Examples of this include the proposal initially put forward by the Commission for rebuilding fish stocks of southern hake and lobster and the most recent proposal on recovery of European eel.\nI should like to finish by saying that the development of scientific research and technology sharing at Community level are key factors if we are to adopt more environmentally-friendly fishing rules.

The user provided a debate summary about environmentally friendly fishing methods and wants the main points from Duarte Freitas, who is part of the PPE-DE group. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the debate summary to find any mentions of Duarte Freitas. The user mentioned that contributions from other speakers shouldn't be included, only those attributed to Duarte Freitas.\n\nLooking at the \"Positions and Arguments\" section, there's a mention of Duarte Freitas and Iles Braghetto advocating for decentralized approaches within the CFP structure. The key here is that Duarte Freitas supports working within the existing CFP framework but with a decentralized approach. \n\nThe \"Key Proposals\" section talks about technical measures, financial incentives, monitoring, stakeholder collaboration, and market-based solutions. However, specific proposals linked to Duarte Freitas aren't detailed here. The summary mentions that he and Braghetto wanted decentralized approaches, which is part of the positions, but there's no specific proposal listed under his name.\n\nSo, the issueSum would be about the need for decentralized approaches within the CFP. The positionSum would state his support for the CFP framework with decentralization. The argSum might be that he believes in modifying the existing framework rather than replacing it. However, the original debate summary doesn't provide arguments beyond the position. The propSum would be the decentralized approach within CFP.\n\nWait, but the example response includes \"propSum\" as a proposal. In the debate summary, the only thing mentioned about Duarte Freitas is that he advocated for decentralized approaches within the CFP structure. So the propSum would be that he proposed decentralized approaches. But the user's example has \"propSum\" as a specific action. However, the debate summary doesn't mention any specific proposals from him beyond the decentralized approach. \n\nSo, structuring the JSON: issueSum would be the CFP framework and decentralization. PositionSum is supporting CFP with decentralized approaches. ArgSum might be that he believes in working within the existing framework. PropSum is advocating for decentralized approaches. But I need to check if the original text mentions any arguments or just positions. The original text says \"Duarte Freitas and Iles Braghetto advocated for decentralized approaches within the CFP structure.\" So the argument is that decentralization is the way to go. But the user's example has \"argSum\" as the reasoning. However, the debate summary doesn't provide arguments beyond the position. So maybe the argSum is not present. Wait, the user's instruction says to include arguments used to justify positions. But if the debate summary doesn't mention any arguments, then it's empty. \n\nIn the given debate summary, under \"Positions and Arguments,\" it's mentioned that Duarte Freitas and others supported decentralized approaches within the CFP. But there's no explicit argument provided for why they think that. So the argSum might be empty. However, the example response includes an argument. But in this case, the debate summary doesn't have more details. So perhaps the answer is that there are no arguments or proposals attributed to him beyond the position. Wait, but the user said that if there are no points, respond with an empty string. \n\nBut according to the debate summary, the only thing mentioned about Duarte Freitas is that he advocated for decentralized approaches within the CFP structure. So the position is supporting CFP with decentralization. The issue is the implementation approaches under CFP. The propSum would be the decentralized approach. But the user's example has \"propSum\" as a proposal. So in this case, the propSum would be \"advocated for decentralized approaches within the CFP structure.\" \n\nBut the user's example has \"propSum\" as a summary of proposals. So I need to structure that. However, the original debate summary doesn't mention any specific proposals beyond the decentralized approach. So the propSum would be that he proposed decentralized approaches. \n\nTherefore, the JSON would have:\n\nissueSum: \"The issue relates to the implementation approaches within the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) framework.\"\npositionSum: \"Duarte Freitas supported working within the existing CFP framework with decentralized approaches.\"\nargSum: \"\" (since there's no explicit argument provided in the debate summary)\npropSum: \"Advocated for decentralized approaches within the CFP structure.\"\n\nBut the user's example includes \"argSum\" even if it's a brief statement. However, in the given debate summary, there's no argument provided for why he supports decentralized approaches. So maybe the argSum is empty. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the argument is that he believes in the CFP's potential but needs decentralization. But the debate summary doesn't state that. Therefore, the argSum would be empty. \n\nSo the final JSON would have:\n\n{\n  \"issueSum\": \"The issue relates to the implementation approaches within the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) framework.\",\n  \"positionSum\": \"Duarte Freitas supported working within the existing CFP framework with decentralized approaches.\",\n  \"argSum\": \"\",\n  \"propSum\": \"Advocated for decentralized approaches within the CFP structure.\"\n}\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The issue relates to the implementation approaches within the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) framework.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"Duarte Freitas supported working within the existing CFP framework with decentralized approaches.\",\n\"argSum\": \"\",\n\"propSum\": \"Advocated for decentralized approaches within the CFP structure.\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Paulo Casaca (PSE).", "english": "Paulo Casaca (PSE). \u2013 (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to add my warm congratulations to Mr \u00d3 Neachtain.

Even in ancient times legal and technical measures were put in place in order to limit catches and avoid depleting the stocks and damaging the biomass and consequently the environment. Only in the particular circumstances of the early 19th\u00a0century were all restrictions on fishing lifted. At the end of the century things returned to normal, in other words, protective restrictions were reintroduced. It seems that more complex protective measures based on scientific research were developed mid-way through the 20th\u00a0century. These favoured so-called optimal fishing that involved regulating the age of the first catch. There followed provisions on the permitted size of fish caught and the principles of selective fishing gear. On the other hand, they simply restricted the limits, fishing effort and fishing potential.\nAs to specific issues in the document before us, I believe it is worth mentioning the new approach to protective principles. In contrast to the protective measures applied to date, which mainly related to selective fishing, it is now proposed to protect the hitherto unwanted elements of the catch. I think this is eminently rational and indeed noble. It would seem to be a case of political correctness as applied to fish. Will this really be beneficial to the environment, though? Experience has shown that selective fishing always weakens the biological strength of desirable species in the ecosystem. The less useful species can take over the niche vacated by the more desirable ones.

In this way fishermen, realising the importance of and the need for the measures, will contribute to their more effective application.\nThirdly, more environmentally-friendly fishing methods imply less and more selective fishing, new equipment and loss of income.

The issue he's addressing is the effectiveness of the CFP. His argument is that the CFP is foundational and needs reform within its framework, not abandonment. The proposals he might have made are advocating for decentralized approaches within the CFP. \n\nBut the user's example response structure requires issueSum, positionSum, argSum, propSum. So, the key issue here is the effectiveness and need for reform of the CFP. His position is supporting the CFP as a basis for sustainable fisheries. The argument is that it's a cornerstone, so reforms should be within the existing framework. The proposal is decentralized approaches within the CFP structure.\n\nWait, but the user's example response for Joe Borg would need to be based on the given debate summary. The user's example response in the query is about the Data Act, but the actual task is about Joe Borg's speech in the fishing debate.\n\nSo, compiling that:\n\nissueSum: The issue is the effectiveness and necessity of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) in promoting sustainable fisheries.\n\npositionSum: Joe Borg supports the CFP as a fundamental framework for sustainable fisheries and advocates for reforms within its structure.\n\nargSum: His argument is that the CFP is a cornerstone and the basis for sustainable fisheries, implying that it's viable to reform it rather than replace it.\n\npropSum: He proposes decentralized approaches within the CFP structure to achieve sustainability.\n\nI need to make sure that these points are directly from the debate summary and not including other speakers' points. The user specified that only the speaker's own contributions should be included. Since Joe Borg is mentioned as defending the CFP, the response should reflect that.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The issue revolves around the effectiveness and necessity of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) in promoting sustainable fisheries.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"Joe Borg defended the CFP, asserting it is a cornerstone and the foundation for sustainable fisheries in the EU.\",\n\"argSum\": \"He argued that the CFP provides a critical framework for sustainability and that reforms should focus on improving it rather than abandoning it.\",\n\"propSum\": \"He advocated for decentralized approaches within the CFP structure to enhance sustainability.\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "President.", "english": "President.

The user provided a parliamentary debate summary about environmentally friendly fishing methods and wants the main points of the speaker named \"President.\" \n\nFirst, I need to check the debate summary to see if the President is mentioned. The summary lists 16 speakers, but the user specified \"President\" as the speaker.
