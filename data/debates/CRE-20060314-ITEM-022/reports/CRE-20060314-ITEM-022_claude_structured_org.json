I say to colleagues and especially to you, Commissioner, that this has to stop. Are there dishonest people in the fisheries sector? Of course there are, just like in every other sector \u2013 economic or otherwise \u2013 known to man. If someone is guilty of criminal activity then let the full force of the appropriate law apply. On the other hand, we must put a stop to the insidious branding of the entire fisheries profession with the same brush of dishonesty. We must never forget that the great majority of men and women involved in the sector are honest, dedicated and extremely hard-working people.\nFurthermore, no meaningful change can be achieved without the active involvement and participation of those honest fishermen and women. In recent years the key challenge to maintaining sustainable fisheries has, to a large extent, developed into an overly simplistic and polarising debate on whether or not we should have more or less fishing. In reality the challenge of rebuilding stocks and maintaining sustainability is also about developing new and better ways of fishing through the utilisation and development of new technology.\nThe objective of maintaining sustainability must, most centrally, embrace the question of how we fish in the future so that we harvest our marine resources in the most environmentally favourable way. The introduction of fishing practices that reduce adverse impacts on our ecosystems is a priority. To achieve that we must first understand the effects of fishing practices on the marine environment and promote fishing activities that are environmentally sustainable. I am particularly pleased that the last Irish Presidency proposed the initiative of a major EU programme to make fishing activity more environmentally friendly in order to help to build European fish stocks.\nThis is an urgent matter. The urgency is clearly illustrated by one extraordinary statistic: 20 million tonnes of fish are being discarded worldwide every year, equivalent to about one quarter of total world catches. In the words of the then Irish Presidency, over-fishing is part of the overall problem; but taking that amount of fish out of the seas and then throwing it overboard is shockingly wasteful and has to be substantially reduced in the short term. I am sure that you will agree with me that we are going nowhere unless that happens, and that we must do something positive about it.\nIt is gratifying that we in the European Union are prepared to take the lead to tackle that worldwide problem and deal with such a wasteful side-effect of the fishing industry.

It includes the proposal to fast-track the development of more selective fishing gear.

Fishermen and women will have their say in this process through their regional advisory councils, which will have an extremely important role to play. There is no doubt in my mind that fishermen will fully subscribe to this new environmentally friendly approach. They will do so because it will contribute to sustainable fisheries. They will do so because it will contribute to improving fish stocks. They will do so because it will ensure that fish stocks are properly preserved for future generations.\nCommissioner, if you want this programme to work then you must ensure that there are proposals for financial and other incentives, including additional quota entitlements to encourage fishermen to move towards more selective and more environmentally friendly fishing gear.\nI hope that you will agree with me, Commissioner, that in the current context that will be a small price to pay.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Neachtain (UEN), rapporteur . \u2013 Mr President, I will start my presentation on promoting more environmentally friendly fishing methods by reminding Parliament that in recent times fishermen collectively have been seriously under attack.\nBecause of illegal actions by the few, there is a growing public perception that collectively fishermen are all potential criminals.

Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr \u00d3 Neachtain, and the Committee on Fisheries for the constructive report on more environmentally friendly fishing methods and for the interest they have shown in the communication from the Commission. I cannot agree more with what the rapporteur has just said regarding the honesty and integrity of fishermen; the abuses of the few should not be blamed on everyone at large and we need to clamp down strongly on the real culprits.\nThe Commission attaches great importance to the development of more environmentally friendly fishing methods. Improving selectivity is one of the objectives of the technical measures that we propose in that context. In that regard, I am pleased to note that some progress has been achieved on the technical measures in the Baltic that were adopted by the Council in December, and the Commission intends to increase selectivity and the new technical measures to be proposed for the Mediterranean Sea, the Atlantic and North Sea.\nI have noted your interest in combating ghost fishing. The Commission is prepared to be at the forefront of this battle. Following the Deepnet report, measures were decided, in the last TAC and in the quota regulation for 2006, to ban temporarily deepwater gillnet fishery in the areas covered by the report and concerned by this activity until such time as permanent measures \u2013 also applicable to other areas, in lieu of a complete ban \u2013 are adopted, hopefully, during this year. I have also reserved funds to support retrieval surveys of ghost nets. The Commission will continue to follow these issues with particular attention.\nThe reduction of discards will be a major objective of the new technical measures for the Atlantic and the North Sea. It needs to be underscored that, due to the variety of the catch composition and the level of discards in European Union waters, the regional aspects of the different fisheries will be taken into account. The various areas to be considered will correspond to the spheres of influence of the different RACs, thereby incorporating more easily the proposals made by those councils, a positive evaluation being made by the relevant RAC.\nThe Commission is encouraging the industry to engage in pilot programmes by making use of the RACs for this purpose. Two such pilot projects have already been carried out in France and Sweden. Further pilot projects, in full cooperation with the industry, will allow us to test on a case-by-case basis possible measures to reduce discards effectively.\nThe Commission is also encouraging the development of efforts in fisheries management in the Kattegat in cooperation with Denmark, Sweden and Germany. This will hopefully lead to positive results later this year. This kind of management, among other objectives, is aimed at reducing or eliminating discards.\nBycatch reduction is linked to selectivity and discard issues and, at international level, the Commission has promoted a global approach for bycatch issues within the FAO. This could result in an international plan of action on bycatch reduction and/or technical guidelines elaborated by the FAO.\nMost of the measures to promote environmentally friendly fishing methods will be included in the new technical measures for the Atlantic and the North Sea. As you know, technical measures are considered as a complement to effort limitations, TACs and quotas, long-term management and recovery plans, and as part of the overall package of management measures.\nI have noted your request to simplify the regulatory system and can inform you that these new technical measures will be a fundamental test case in the simplification programme led by the Commission. They are one of the principal points of the action plan on simplification.\nTurning to the amendments: with regard to Amendment 1 on centralisation and co-management, the Commission would like to see substantial RAC involvement in the elaboration of technical measures without, however, any change to the decision-making process. The Commission agrees with taking into account initiatives of RACs so as to improve fisheries management and can accept that point on condition that the positive effects of such measures are confirmed by scientific assessment. I would like to emphasise that we already have examples to illustrate that the Commission takes into account proposals from the RACs, such as the case of the French square-meshed panel, the Swedish grid and the proposed new rule under which \u2013 for safety reasons \u2013 the cod line is to be placed as far as ten metres, instead of one metre, away from the meshes of the cod end when using an onboard pump system in pelagic fisheries.\nIt is premature to give a definitive reaction to Amendment 2, since discussions on depleted fish stocks are still under way.

Our group is satisfied with the report and we also support the two amendments tabled. The report is very timely. Last month, it became public knowledge that a number of deep-sea fish are threatened with exhaustion and even extinction. There are no two ways about it: the fish stocks are in a desperate fix and a change of tack towards sustainable and environmentally-friendly fisheries is desperately needed, and affects us all.\nLet me begin by saying that fishermen will need to adjust to the depletion of fish stocks. While there is a need for technical measures, such as acoustic deterring devices, electric impulses which will render the disturbance of the sea bed unnecessary, adequate mesh sizes and fish hooks in order to minimise bycatch, non-technical measures are at least equally important. I am mainly concerned about preventing illegal fishing and introducing marine reserves so as to replenish fish populations.\nThis sounds simple, but it is an unfortunate fact that it is not. Our group stresses the need for fishermen to be encouraged to apply sustainable methods. The fisheries sector is having a tough time, not least due to increasing oil prices. In this light, we need an active and involved government in order to promote sustainable fishing. The governments must also stand surety for control and enforcement. Illegal fishing renders the situation impossible for all parties. Without effective control measures, this situation will irrevocably lead to a tragedy of common sense. Everyone stands to lose and soon there will be no fish left to catch.\nThirdly, consumers must also be involved in sustainable fishing. Many consumers wish to buy well-caught fish, but they do not know which of the fish is sustainable. Certification and quality marks are therefore important. Sustainable fish is, first and foremost, fish that is not overfished, without unnecessary bycatch and discards, and good information to consumers is needed in this respect. Only then will consumers take an informed decision in favour of sustainably caught fish.\nFinally, in order to make a change of tack possible, we as politicians must shoulder our responsibility. We must constantly draw the attention to sustainable fishing and we must act; we must respond to the fishermen who make the temporary introduction of marine reserves possible, thus ensuring that they do not lose their incomes in the short term. The report that is before us constitutes a few sound steps in that direction and these must be fleshed out in the near future. Needless to say, the fishing industry must be involved in the measures. Only with responsible politicians and active government, innovative fishermen and involved consumers can both the fishing industry and the fish look forward to a sustainable future.", "lang": "NL", "original": "Dorette Corbey, namens de PSE-Fractie . \u2013 Voorzitter, commissaris, collega's, allereerst mijn complimenten voor het uitstekende verslag van collega \u00d3 Neachtain. Onze fractie is ingenomen met het verslag en wij steunen ook de twee amendementen die nog ingebracht zijn. Het verslag komt op een belangrijk moment. Vorige maand werd bekend dat een aantal diepzeevissen met uitputting en zelfs uitsterving bedreigd worden. We kunnen er niet meer onderuit, het gaat slecht met de visstanden en koersverandering in de richting van een duurzame en milieuvriendelijke visserij is hard nodig en die verandering treft ons allemaal.\nLaat ik beginnen bij de vissers, zij zullen zich moeten aanpassen aan het feit dat visbestanden uitgeput raken. Technische maatregelen zijn nodig, zoals akoestische afschrikmiddelen, elektrische impulsen om bodemberoering overbodig te maken, adequate mazen en vishaken om bijvangst te minimaliseren, maar de niet-technische maatregelen zijn minstens even belangrijk. Daarbij denk ik in de eerste plaats aan het voorkomen van illegale visvangst en het instellen van visreservaten. Vispopulaties krijgen zo weer de kans om te groeien.\nHet klinkt eenvoudig, maar dat is het helaas niet. Onze fractie benadrukt dat vissers in staat gesteld moeten worden, duurzame methoden toe te passen. De visserijsector heeft het niet gemakkelijk, alleen al vanwege de stijgende olieprijzen. Daarmee is een actieve en betrokken overheid noodzakelijk om duurzame visserij te bevorderen. De overheden moeten daarnaast garant staan voor controle en handhaving. Illegale visserij maakt de situatie onmogelijk voor alle partijen. Zonder effectieve controle leidt dit onherroepelijk tot een tragedy of the common sense. Iedereen verliest en er is straks geen vis meer over.\nTen derde moet ook de consument betrokken worden bij duurzame visserij. Veel consumenten willen goed gevangen vis kopen, maar ze weten niet welke vis duurzaam is. Certificering en keurmerken zijn daarom belangrijk. Duurzame vis is allereerst vis die niet wordt overbevist zonder onnodige bijvangst en teruggooi, en goede voorlichting aan consumenten is daarbij nodig. Alleen dan zal de consument ook weloverwogen kiezen voor duurzaam gevangen vis.\nTen slotte, om een koersverandering mogelijk te maken, moeten we ook als politici verantwoordelijkheid nemen. We moeten voortdurend de aandacht vragen voor duurzame visserij en we moeten handelen; we moeten een antwoord geven aan die vissers die de instelling van visreservaten tijdelijk mogelijk maken, zodat ze tijdelijk niet hun inkomens verliezen. Het verslag dat voor ons ligt zijn een aantal goede stappen in die richting en deze moeten vorm krijgen in de nabije toekomst. De visserijsector moet natuurlijk bij de maatregelen betrokken worden. Alleen met verantwoordelijke politici en actieve overheid, innovatieve vissers en betrokken consumenten hebben zowel de visserijsector als de vis een duurzame toekomst.", "agenda_item": "More environmentally friendly fishing methods (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060314-ITEM-022", "intervention_id": "2-406", "summary_english": "{\n\"headline\": \"Urgent Need for Sustainable Fishing with Government Support, Consumer Involvement, and Marine Reserves to Prevent Fish Stock Collapse\",\n\"issueSum\": \"The speaker highlights the critical depletion of fish stocks, with deep-sea fish threatened with exhaustion and extinction.

This sustainability should also be based on technical measures arising from scientific fishing research, in particular via the implementation of closed seasons, prohibited zones and mesh size regulations.\nThat being said, we feel that fisheries management policies should not be used to penalise this strategically valuable activity, which is of vital economic and social importance. It is therefore necessary to strike a balance between meeting social and economic needs and environmental sustainability, in particular by implementing appropriate social and economic measures to compensate fishermen for the costs of reducing their activities connected with plans to rebuild depleted stocks, especially those working in less well-developed areas. Given that the common fisheries policy is a common policy, we believe that those taking decisions in this field need to take responsibility for those decisions. Consequently, we have retabled an amendment calling on the Commission to propose social and economic compensation measures aimed at providing Community funding for plans to rebuild depleted fish stocks.\nSimilarly, as we believe that fishermen and their representative associations should be involved in determining measures to protect the marine environment and rebuild fish stocks, we have retabled an amendment stating that decentralisation and co-management are two principles that are fundamental both in guaranteeing the involvement of fishermen and their representative associations in measures to protect the marine environment and rebuild fish stocks, but also in guaranteeing the effectiveness of such measures, bearing in mind that it is the fishermen and their associations, who have first-hand knowledge of the state of resources and who are most concerned to ensure their preservation, who will be applying such measures.", "lang": "PT", "original": "Pedro Guerreiro, em nome do Grupo GUE/NGL . \u2013 Em primeiro lugar, gostaria de saudar o relator pela abertura e esfor\u00e7o de s\u00edntese que demonstrou na elabora\u00e7\u00e3o do seu relat\u00f3rio, que na generalidade acompanh\u00e1mos e que foi aprovado por unanimidade pela Comiss\u00e3o das Pescas.\nSem d\u00favida que a sustentabilidade dos recursos hali\u00eauticos \u00e9 fundamental para garantir a longo prazo a actividade piscat\u00f3ria e a viabilidade do sector das pescas.\nA sustentabilidade dos recursos que deve basear-se numa abordagem abrangente quanto \u00e0s medidas de protec\u00e7\u00e3o do meio marinho e de recupera\u00e7\u00e3o das unidades populacionais de pescado, dever\u00e1 igualmente considerar factores como a polui\u00e7\u00e3o costeira e de alto mar, os afluentes industriais e agr\u00edcolas, a dragagem de fundos e o transporte mar\u00edtimo.

I also wish to say that I wholeheartedly welcome the Commission's initiative in issuing a communication on promoting more environmentally-friendly fishing methods.\nThe technical conservation measures have a more important role than ever in the future of the sector. It is crucial that we adopt methods to improve selectivity and, therefore, the possibility of catching fish at the right size, taking account of biology and the life cycle of each individual species.\nThe satisfactory reproduction of fish, and in turn increased stocks, will only be possible if there are appropriate management measures, such as the temporary closure of certain fishing areas, to reduce bycatch to sustainable levels, and the effective practice of monitoring of vessels and fishing areas by means of satellite technology.\nIt is also necessary to become aware of the specific characteristics of fishing practices in the various Member States. This knowledge will help to implement appropriate, well-balanced measures that will ensure the recovery and management of fish sources and safeguard the overriding interests of fishermen and vessel owners. It is accordingly necessary to adopt a decentralised approach taking account of the specific characteristics of fishing areas and different species.\nIn spite of the Commission\u2019s good intentions, a more decentralised approach is sometimes needed on important and sensitive questions regarding the economic and environmental sustainability of fisheries. Examples of this include the proposal initially put forward by the Commission for rebuilding fish stocks of southern hake and lobster and the most recent proposal on recovery of European eel.\nI should like to finish by saying that the development of scientific research and technology sharing at Community level are key factors if we are to adopt more environmentally-friendly fishing rules.

I do feel, however, that much remains to be done, in the autonomous region of the Azores and in all Community waters, as regards these more environmentally-friendly methods.\nWhat is needed is, firstly, more first-hand fisheries management, with the fundamental concept of the marine habitat placed at the heart of fisheries policy implementation. Secondly, we must prioritise the problem of discards, as the rapporteur has done.\nWe know that there are other countries within and outside Europe that operate a ban on any discard and I see no reason why we should not act more quickly and follow suit in the EU.\nThere is also the crucial problem of satellite systems for monitoring and detecting vessels, on which there is much to do if they are to comply fully. Lastly, I should therefore like to ask the Commission to take on board the need to implement these systems at the earliest opportunity and to ensure their effective use.", "lang": "PT", "original": "Paulo Casaca (PSE). \u2013 Senhor Presidente, senhor Comiss\u00e1rio e caros Colegas, associo-me vivamente \u00e0s felicita\u00e7\u00f5es que j\u00e1 aqui foram endere\u00e7adas ao nosso colega Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Neachtain.

Even in ancient times legal and technical measures were put in place in order to limit catches and avoid depleting the stocks and damaging the biomass and consequently the environment. Only in the particular circumstances of the early 19th\u00a0century were all restrictions on fishing lifted. At the end of the century things returned to normal, in other words, protective restrictions were reintroduced. It seems that more complex protective measures based on scientific research were developed mid-way through the 20th\u00a0century. These favoured so-called optimal fishing that involved regulating the age of the first catch. There followed provisions on the permitted size of fish caught and the principles of selective fishing gear. On the other hand, they simply restricted the limits, fishing effort and fishing potential.\nAs to specific issues in the document before us, I believe it is worth mentioning the new approach to protective principles. In contrast to the protective measures applied to date, which mainly related to selective fishing, it is now proposed to protect the hitherto unwanted elements of the catch. I think this is eminently rational and indeed noble. It would seem to be a case of political correctness as applied to fish. Will this really be beneficial to the environment, though? Experience has shown that selective fishing always weakens the biological strength of desirable species in the ecosystem. The less useful species can take over the niche vacated by the more desirable ones.

(EL) Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur and to add that, despite the actions taken by the European Union, fish stocks are under constant threat and that this is due to three very important factors: firstly intensive rates of fishing, secondly fishing methods and thirdly maritime pollution.\nThe Committee on Fisheries adopted a report in January, the purpose of which is to promote environmentally-friendly fishing methods by proposing various technical measures, such as the definition of fishing areas, fishing periods and fishing tools.\nWe all wish for and are seeking sustainable exploitation of the seas and that is why we all need to move in this direction. As part of this effort, I too should like to emphasise certain things:\nFirstly, the measures applied must be based on adequate, substantiated scientific studies, taking account of the peculiarities of each area.\nSecondly, fishing organisations must have a right of participation, opinion and codecision in the overall procedure. In this way fishermen, realising the importance of and the need for the measures, will contribute to their more effective application.\nThirdly, more environmentally-friendly fishing methods imply less and more selective fishing, new equipment and loss of income.

(EL) Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur and to add that, despite the actions taken by the European Union, fish stocks are under constant threat and that this is due to three very important factors: firstly intensive rates of fishing, secondly fishing methods and thirdly maritime pollution.\nThe Committee on Fisheries adopted a report in January, the purpose of which is to promote environmentally-friendly fishing methods by proposing various technical measures, such as the definition of fishing areas, fishing periods and fishing tools.\nWe all wish for and are seeking sustainable exploitation of the seas and that is why we all need to move in this direction. As part of this effort, I too should like to emphasise certain things:\nFirstly, the measures applied must be based on adequate, substantiated scientific studies, taking account of the peculiarities of each area.\nSecondly, fishing organisations must have a right of participation, opinion and codecision in the overall procedure. In this way fishermen, realising the importance of and the need for the measures, will contribute to their more effective application.\nThirdly, more environmentally-friendly fishing methods imply less and more selective fishing, new equipment and loss of income.

Debate Information\n\n**Topic:** More Environmentally Friendly Fishing Methods  \n**Number of Contributions:** 15 speakers participated in this comprehensive debate  \n**Date:** Not specified in the provided materials  \n**Context:** Parliamentary debate addressing the urgent need for sustainable fishing practices within the EU's Common Fisheries Policy framework\n\n## 2. Executive Summary\n\n### Key Issues Identified\n\nThe debate revealed several critical environmental and economic challenges facing EU fisheries:\n\n**Fish Stock Depletion:** Multiple speakers highlighted the alarming state of fish populations, with Dorette Corbey noting that \"deep-sea fish facing depletion and extinction\" and the urgent need for \"koersverandering in de richting van een duurzame en milieuvriendelijke visserij\" (course change toward sustainable and environmentally friendly fishing).\n\n**Massive Discard Problem:** A recurring concern was the wasteful practice of discarding unwanted catch. Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Neachtain and Struan Stevenson both emphasized that \"20 million tonnes of fish are being discarded worldwide every year, equivalent to about one quarter of total world catches,\" with \"1 million tons discarded in Europe every year.\"\n\n**Policy Implementation Challenges:** Ian Hudghton critically assessed the Common Fisheries Policy, arguing that \"The CFP itself, I would contend, is not environmentally friendly: TACs and quotas measure not the amount of fish caught but only the fish landed. Discards are caused by the CFP, rather than prevented by it.\"\n\n### Positions and Arguments\n\n**Pro-Industry Support Approach:** Several speakers emphasized supporting fishermen through the transition. Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Neachtain strongly advocated that \"We must put a stop to the insidious branding of the entire fisheries profession with the same brush of dishonesty\" and called for \"financial incentives and additional quota entitlements to encourage fishermen to move towards more selective and more environmentally friendly fishing gear.\"\n\n**Comprehensive Environmental Approach:** Struan Stevenson argued for examining factors beyond overfishing, citing evidence that \"despite a 60% reduction in fishing vessels through decommissioning over five years, cod stocks have not recovered as expected,\" suggesting other environmental factors are at play.\n\n**Stakeholder Participation:** Multiple speakers emphasized involving fishermen in decision-making. James Nicholson argued that \"It is in every fisherman's interest that future stocks are protected\" and advocated for treating fishermen as partners rather than adversaries. Similarly, Ioannis Gklavakis proposed that \"fishing organisations must have a right of participation, opinion and codecision in the overall procedure.\"\n\n**Technical Solutions:** Speakers proposed various technical measures. Kathy Sinnott advocated for \"increasing minimum mesh sizes to 90 millimeters\" and emphasized that \"Ninety millimetres should be the minimum mesh size in order to protect nursery areas and reduce discards.\"\n\n### Key Proposals\n\n**Financial and Technical Support:**\n- EU funding for environmentally friendly gear adoption\n- Pilot projects for selective fishing technologies\n- Socio-economic compensation for affected fishing communities\n\n**Policy Reform:**\n- Review of technical conservation measures within two years\n- Implementation of science-based management approaches\n- Enhanced satellite monitoring and vessel control systems\n\n**Immediate Actions:**\n- Complete ban on fish discards following examples from non-EU countries\n- Prohibition of deep-water gill netting\n- Establishment of fishing reserves and closed areas\n\n**Market-Based Solutions:**\n- Development of eco-labelling and certification systems for sustainable fisheries\n- Consumer education initiatives\n\n### Commissioner's Response\n\nJoe Borg, representing the European Commission, acknowledged the challenges while defending the CFP framework. He emphasized that \"environmentally friendly fishing methods are in the interests of the fishermen first and foremost\" and argued that \"unless we reverse the trend as regards over-capacity and fishing effort, we will not deal with the problem effectively.\" The Commission committed to pilot projects, eco-labelling proposals, and enhanced monitoring systems.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe debate revealed broad consensus on the need for more sustainable fishing practices, with disagreement primarily on implementation approaches. While some speakers called for radical CFP reform, others advocated for incremental improvements with strong industry support. The emphasis on stakeholder participation, financial incentives, and science-based management emerged as common themes, suggesting a pathway toward more collaborative and environmentally sustainable EU fisheries policy.", "src_model": "claude", "model_type": "claude", "model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "structured": true, "incremental": false, "hierarchical": false, "grouped": false, "shuffle": false, "prompt": false, "lang": "original"}
