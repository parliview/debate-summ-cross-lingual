{"speaker": "Paulo Casaca (PSE).", "english": "Paulo Casaca (PSE). \u2013 (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to add my warm congratulations to Mr \u00d3 Neachtain. This report concerns a Commission communication which lies at the heart of the common fisheries policy. I feel that in this and other areas, and using other instruments, we need to find solutions to the problems that we are facing, and that, accordingly, this debate today is of vital importance.\nIn the autonomous region of the Azores, considerable progress has been made in recent years, not least the prohibition of bottom gillnets and bottom trawls. I do feel, however, that much remains to be done, in the autonomous region of the Azores and in all Community waters, as regards these more environmentally-friendly methods.\nWhat is needed is, firstly, more first-hand fisheries management, with the fundamental concept of the marine habitat placed at the heart of fisheries policy implementation. Secondly, we must prioritise the problem of discards, as the rapporteur has done.\nWe know that there are other countries within and outside Europe that operate a ban on any discard and I see no reason why we should not act more quickly and follow suit in the EU.\nThere is also the crucial problem of satellite systems for monitoring and detecting vessels, on which there is much to do if they are to comply fully. Lastly, I should therefore like to ask the Commission to take on board the need to implement these systems at the earliest opportunity and to ensure their effective use.", "lang": "PT", "original": "Paulo Casaca (PSE). \u2013 Senhor Presidente, senhor Comiss\u00e1rio e caros Colegas, associo-me vivamente \u00e0s felicita\u00e7\u00f5es que j\u00e1 aqui foram endere\u00e7adas ao nosso colega Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Neachtain.
