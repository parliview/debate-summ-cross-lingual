This report has our firm support; in fact, if fisheries activities are made more environmentally friendly this will also contribute to promoting positive socio-economic conditions.\nI am convinced that it will only be possible to correctly apply the technical rules governing fishing if fishermen are willing to comply. It is therefore necessary to reinforce cooperation, agreement and participation by all those involved in the assessment, implementation and drafting of all technical measures to be adopted, and to promote a decentralised approach; in this way, once again, the European Union will decide not for its citizens but together with them.", "lang": "IT", "original": "Iles Braghetto (PPE-DE). \u2013 Signor Presidente, signor Commissario, onorevoli colleghi, promuovere metodi di pesca rispettosi dell\u2019ambiente marino dimostra una forte presa di coscienza da parte dell\u2019Unione europea sulle difficolt\u00e0 che il settore attraversa e sull\u2019esigenza di interventi strutturali per uno sfruttamento responsabile delle risorse acquatiche.\nRidurre la pressione di pesca, perch\u00e9 gli stock ittici si trovano in cattive condizioni, ottimizzare le catture evitando che ingenti quantitativi di pesce per lo pi\u00f9 immaturo vengano gettati in mare, ridurre l\u2019impatto su habitat particolarmente sensibili \u2013 sono questi gli obiettivi principali e condivisibili della politica comune della pesca.\nAdottare misure intese a proteggere e conservare le risorse acquatiche vive, a garantirne uno sfruttamento sostenibile, a individuare misure compensative per il mancato reddito, a sostenere lo sviluppo per la ricerca e l\u2019innovazione, sono impegni prioritari definiti dalla relazione in esame. Tale relazione che ha il nostro convinto sostegno, infatti se si rendono le attivit\u00e0 di pesca pi\u00f9 rispettose dell\u2019ambiente si contribuisce anche alla promozione di condizioni socioeconomiche positive.\nSono convinto che le norme tecniche che disciplinano la pesca potranno essere correttamente applicate soltanto se i pescatori saranno disposti a farlo.
