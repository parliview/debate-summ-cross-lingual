{"speaker": "Duarte Freitas (PPE-DE).", "english": "Duarte Freitas (PPE-DE). \u2013 (PT) I should first like to thank the rapporteur and congratulate him on his work. I also wish to say that I wholeheartedly welcome the Commission's initiative in issuing a communication on promoting more environmentally-friendly fishing methods.\nThe technical conservation measures have a more important role than ever in the future of the sector. It is crucial that we adopt methods to improve selectivity and, therefore, the possibility of catching fish at the right size, taking account of biology and the life cycle of each individual species.\nThe satisfactory reproduction of fish, and in turn increased stocks, will only be possible if there are appropriate management measures, such as the temporary closure of certain fishing areas, to reduce bycatch to sustainable levels, and the effective practice of monitoring of vessels and fishing areas by means of satellite technology.\nIt is also necessary to become aware of the specific characteristics of fishing practices in the various Member States. This knowledge will help to implement appropriate, well-balanced measures that will ensure the recovery and management of fish sources and safeguard the overriding interests of fishermen and vessel owners. It is accordingly necessary to adopt a decentralised approach taking account of the specific characteristics of fishing areas and different species.\nIn spite of the Commission\u2019s good intentions, a more decentralised approach is sometimes needed on important and sensitive questions regarding the economic and environmental sustainability of fisheries. Examples of this include the proposal initially put forward by the Commission for rebuilding fish stocks of southern hake and lobster and the most recent proposal on recovery of European eel.\nI should like to finish by saying that the development of scientific research and technology sharing at Community level are key factors if we are to adopt more environmentally-friendly fishing rules. In this context, I feel that we need to pay close attention to the channelling of funds that will be available as part of the new Community framework for supporting research.", "lang": "PT", "original": "Duarte Freitas (PPE-DE). \u2013 Quero, em primeiro lugar, agradecer e dar os parab\u00e9ns ao relator pelo trabalho realizado e referir que considero muito positiva a iniciativa da Comiss\u00e3o Europeia que lan\u00e7aram a comunica\u00e7\u00e3o sobre a promo\u00e7\u00e3o de m\u00e9todos de pesca mais respeitadores do ambiente.\nDe facto, o papel das medidas t\u00e9cnicas de conserva\u00e7\u00e3o reveste-se hoje, mais do que nunca, de uma import\u00e2ncia determinante para o futuro do sector. \u00c9 essencial zelar pela adop\u00e7\u00e3o de m\u00e9todos de pesca capazes de incrementar a selectividade e, por conseguinte, possibilitar a captura de peixes com as dimens\u00f5es correctas tendo em conta a biologia e o ciclo de vida pr\u00f3prio de cada esp\u00e9cie.\nGarantir a reprodu\u00e7\u00e3o satisfat\u00f3ria dos peixes e, consequente, o aumento de efectivos, passa por medidas de gest\u00e3o adequadas, como o encerramento tempor\u00e1rio de determinados pesqueiros, redu\u00e7\u00e3o para n\u00edveis sustent\u00e1veis das capturas acess\u00f3rias, bem como a efectiva pr\u00e1tica de fiscaliza\u00e7\u00e3o das embarca\u00e7\u00f5es e zonas de pesca com recurso ao uso de tecnologias de sat\u00e9lite.\n\u00c9 ainda necess\u00e1rio conhecer as realidades espec\u00edficas de pesca praticada nos diferentes Estados-Membros e, com base nesse conhecimento, garantir a aplica\u00e7\u00e3o de medidas correctas e equilibradas que possam garantir a recupera\u00e7\u00e3o ou gest\u00e3o dos mananciais de pesca ao mesmo tempo que se salvaguarda o interesse principal de pescadores e armadores.
