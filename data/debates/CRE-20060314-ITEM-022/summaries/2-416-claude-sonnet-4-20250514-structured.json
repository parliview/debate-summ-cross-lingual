This has been central to the problem of the common fisheries policy for decades and nothing that has been put in place by way of improvement has worked to date.\nThe cod recovery plan has not achieved the objective. Fishermen in my region of Northern Ireland have faced closure in the Irish Sea for a long number of years and we have not seen any concrete evidence that this has been a success. We need to look at where we are going.\nLet us put the past behind us and start with a clean sheet of paper. It is in every fisherman\u2019s interest that future stocks are protected and, if we must have controls, then let the industry be part of the decision-making process. You cannot continue to shut them out and blame them for non-cooperation. We have that opportunity through the regional consultation process. Let us bring everyone on board and let the industry be listened to and, above all, take on board some of its very good ideas.\nIt is a nonsense that if a fisherman says something, it must be wrong. This cannot be the bottom line for us in the future.", "lang": "EN", "original": "James Nicholson (PPE-DE). \u2013 Mr President, I shall be the last tonight to add my congratulations to the rapporteur on his very good report.
