{"speaker": "Pedro Guerreiro,", "english": "Pedro Guerreiro, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group . \u2013 (PT) I should first like to commend the rapporteur on his openness and his focus in the course of drawing up his report, which we broadly endorse and which was adopted unanimously in the Committee on Fisheries.\nThere is no doubt that the sustainability of fisheries resources is crucial to the long-term survival and viability of the fisheries sector.\nThe sustainability of resources needs to be based on a wide-ranging approach to measures to protect the marine environment and to rebuild depleted stocks, in which other factors such as coastal and offshore pollution, industrial and agricultural effluents, deep-sea dredging and maritime transport are also taken on board. This sustainability should also be based on technical measures arising from scientific fishing research, in particular via the implementation of closed seasons, prohibited zones and mesh size regulations.\nThat being said, we feel that fisheries management policies should not be used to penalise this strategically valuable activity, which is of vital economic and social importance. It is therefore necessary to strike a balance between meeting social and economic needs and environmental sustainability, in particular by implementing appropriate social and economic measures to compensate fishermen for the costs of reducing their activities connected with plans to rebuild depleted stocks, especially those working in less well-developed areas. Given that the common fisheries policy is a common policy, we believe that those taking decisions in this field need to take responsibility for those decisions. Consequently, we have retabled an amendment calling on the Commission to propose social and economic compensation measures aimed at providing Community funding for plans to rebuild depleted fish stocks.\nSimilarly, as we believe that fishermen and their representative associations should be involved in determining measures to protect the marine environment and rebuild fish stocks, we have retabled an amendment stating that decentralisation and co-management are two principles that are fundamental both in guaranteeing the involvement of fishermen and their representative associations in measures to protect the marine environment and rebuild fish stocks, but also in guaranteeing the effectiveness of such measures, bearing in mind that it is the fishermen and their associations, who have first-hand knowledge of the state of resources and who are most concerned to ensure their preservation, who will be applying such measures.", "lang": "PT", "original": "Pedro Guerreiro, em nome do Grupo GUE/NGL . \u2013 Em primeiro lugar, gostaria de saudar o relator pela abertura e esfor\u00e7o de s\u00edntese que demonstrou na elabora\u00e7\u00e3o do seu relat\u00f3rio, que na generalidade acompanh\u00e1mos e que foi aprovado por unanimidade pela Comiss\u00e3o das Pescas.\nSem d\u00favida que a sustentabilidade dos recursos hali\u00eauticos \u00e9 fundamental para garantir a longo prazo a actividade piscat\u00f3ria e a viabilidade do sector das pescas.\nA sustentabilidade dos recursos que deve basear-se numa abordagem abrangente quanto \u00e0s medidas de protec\u00e7\u00e3o do meio marinho e de recupera\u00e7\u00e3o das unidades populacionais de pescado, dever\u00e1 igualmente considerar factores como a polui\u00e7\u00e3o costeira e de alto mar, os afluentes industriais e agr\u00edcolas, a dragagem de fundos e o transporte mar\u00edtimo.
