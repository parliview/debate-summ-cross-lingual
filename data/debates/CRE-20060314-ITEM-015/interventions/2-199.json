{"speaker": "Peter Mandelson,", "english": "Peter Mandelson, Member of the Commission . Mr President, China is not yet qualified to receive recognition of market economy status by Europe. There are technical criteria that China needs to fulfil, and it is making progress towards doing so. Indeed we can, should and are giving every assistance to China to enable it more easily and rapidly to make the technical changes that will enable it to fulfil those criteria. It is important to do that.\nLet me add this related comment. The environment in which Member States and Members of this House come to judge the market economy status of China will be helped and encouraged by China doing more than it is at the moment to open its markets to our exports and to others\u2019 trade, to make sure that it is in full compliance with its WTO accession commitments, and to make sure that where it is taking longer than is reasonable to move towards full compliance with those commitments and WTO rules it makes the necessary changes sooner rather than later. If China were to do that, and to respond to the anxieties felt in Europe and around the world about the growth of its export capacity in a way that rebalanced the terms of trade \u2013 so that as well as people seeing goods coming in ever-growing numbers from China, they were also to see those containers being refilled and returned to China with European and other goods \u2013 it would do more than anything else to still public anxiety about what we are seeing in China. Understandably, people in Europe see the growth of China\u2019s market as a threat, but we must understand it as a huge opportunity for us in Europe to sell our own goods and services to that market in future.\nHowever, China has a responsibility to make sure that no artificial or unreasonable barriers remain in place to European goods and services being sold to the Chinese market in ever-growing numbers. When we get that equation right, then perhaps people will be able to look more sympathetically, as well as technically, at the issue of China\u2019s market economy status.\n(Applause)", "lang": "EN", "original": "Peter Mandelson, Member of the Commission .
