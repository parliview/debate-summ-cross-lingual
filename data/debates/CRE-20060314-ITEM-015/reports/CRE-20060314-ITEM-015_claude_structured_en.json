In 2005 there were more than 11\u00a0000 companies, employing more than 500\u00a0000 workers directly or indirectly and producing around 700 million shoes, representing 10% of world production. I should also point out that, in response to the opening-up process, the footwear industry has been extensively restructured and now concentrates its production on the higher price range in particular. I would say that Europe\u2019s most obvious speciality is the leather industry.\nJust as in the case of textiles, the impact of the liberalisation process has been important in terms of putting an end to the quota system. The monitoring system introduced by the Commission clearly demonstrates that imports, from China in particular \u2013 but not just from China \u2013 have seen a spectacular increase. Last year, the average increase in imports in terms of value and quantity exceeded 450% and, in some cases, it was as high as 900%.\nThe average price of imported footwear has fallen significantly, but the retail price of products has not. This does not support the thesis \u2013 a thesis that we all believe should be defended \u2013 that the true beneficiaries of the process of trade liberalisation should be the consumers.\nA year ago, the European Confederation of the Footwear Industry presented a complaint about dumping practices in the leather footwear sector. This is one of the biggest cases to have arisen in the European Union, and it affects many industries to the tune of more than EUR 800 million.\nOn 23 February, Commissioner Mandelson announced to the media that the Commission was going to recommend an increase in tariffs of 19.4% for China and 16.8% for Vietnam. Children\u2019s and other footwear, which represent a very significant proportion, were not subject to this kind of measure. The fact is that the Commission adopted an unprecedented decision, introducing provisional tariffs for a period of five months by way of an antidumping measure. It should be pointed out that, given the unit value of the products, this measure cannot be seen as extreme. It is a relatively small percentage.\nI am not going to say anything more about dumping. In my capacity as Chairman of the Committee on International Trade, however, I would like to make a few comments on the basis of an initial premise, and that is the need to respect the rules that we have laid down within the framework of the WTO, both inside and outside the Community. I am aware that this is rather more than a simple case of dumping. In some cases, we are talking about the survival of the sector in Europe and also about the possibility of relocation as an appropriate response to developments. As you know, everybody has their arguments in these cases; however, it is inconceivable that the entire European industry should move out.\nAt the same time, it should be pointed out that China is trying to achieve market economy status within the WTO. Certain aspects of the Community\u2019s investigations indicate that, in this case, China has clearly not complied with WTO obligations, either in the field of subsidies, whether hidden or not, or in the field of counterfeits. This is therefore an opportunity, Commissioner, to demonstrate to the citizens that the Commission is going to do everything in its power to ensure that the trade rules are respected, including, if necessary, having recourse to the WTO\u2019s dispute settlement body.\nThese distortions of the market are not restricted to the footwear sector. There are well-founded suspicions that certain forms of illegal support for Chinese exporting companies are offered regularly. Commissioner, in view of the expectations of the industry in question and the sensitivity of European public opinion, I would like to know what actions the Commission will take to ensure that that country respects WTO rules. Political considerations must not take precedence over technical conclusions where antidumping is concerned. The measures that you have proposed are controversial. The European industry and certain Member States are not satisfied with your proposal. Public objections have been expressed to the 'creativity' demonstrated by the Commission in its application of the well-established rules and practices in the field of antidumping. I do not know whether these allegations are true. What I do know is that antidumping investigations are based on laws that must be applied fully without any kind of parallel consideration.\nIn conclusion, I can tell you, Commissioner, that the European Parliament\u2019s Committee on International Trade is going to follow the whole of this process very closely, because we believe that the step taken by the Commission is a first step and that it must be accompanied by an attitude in favour of China and other countries, such as Vietnam, having greater opportunities within international trade while jointly respecting the rules we have laid down.", "lang": "ES", "original": "Enrique Bar\u00f3n Crespo (PSE), autor . \u2013 (ES) Se\u00f1or Presidente, Se\u00f1or\u00edas, se\u00f1or Comisario, la industria del calzado es un sector econ\u00f3mico importante en la Comunidad Europea, mundialmente conocida por la excelencia de sus productos.\nEs un sector compuesto en su mayor\u00eda por peque\u00f1as y medianas empresas localizadas, en muchos casos, en regiones donde constituyen la mayor fuente de empleo. En 2005 hab\u00eda m\u00e1s de 11\u00a0000 empresas que directa o indirectamente empleaban a m\u00e1s de 500\u00a0000 trabajadores, produciendo alrededor de 700 millones de zapatos, lo cual supone un 10 % de la producci\u00f3n mundial. Hay que se\u00f1alar, adem\u00e1s, que, en respuesta al proceso de apertura, la industria del calzado se ha sometido a una reestructuraci\u00f3n extensiva, concentrando su producci\u00f3n sobre todo en la gama de precio m\u00e1s elevado. Yo dir\u00eda que la especialidad europea m\u00e1s clara es la industria del cuero.\nComo ha ocurrido en el caso del textil, el impacto del proceso de liberalizaci\u00f3n ha sido importante al terminar el sistema de cuotas. El sistema de control introducido por la Comisi\u00f3n demuestra claramente que las importaciones, particularmemte de China, pero no solo de China, han crecido de manera espectacular. El a\u00f1o pasado, las cifras en t\u00e9rminos de valor y cantidad superaron en promedio el 450\u00a0% de incremento de importaciones y, en algunos casos, el 900\u00a0%.\nEl precio medio del calzado importado ha descendido significativamente y, sin embargo, el precio de venta de los productos no ha bajado, lo cual no corrobora la tesis, que creemos que es importante defender, de qui\u00e9nes son realmente los beneficiarios del proceso de liberalizaci\u00f3n del comercio. En principio, deben de ser los consumidores.\nHace un a\u00f1o, la Confederaci\u00f3n Europea del Calzado present\u00f3 una queja por pr\u00e1cticas de tipo d\u00famping en el calzado de cuero. Este es uno de los mayores casos planteados en la Uni\u00f3n Europea y que afecta a muchas industrias por un valor de m\u00e1s de 800 millones de euros.\nEl 23 de febrero, el Comisario, se\u00f1or Mandelson, anunci\u00f3 a la prensa que la Comisi\u00f3n iba a recomendar un aumento de aranceles del 19,4\u00a0% para China y del 16,8\u00a0% para Viet Nam. El calzado de ni\u00f1o y otros, que representa una parte muy importante, no eran objeto de este tipo de medidas. El hecho es que la Comisi\u00f3n adopt\u00f3 una decisi\u00f3n sin precedentes, introduciendo unos aranceles provisionales para un periodo de cinco meses en concepto de antid\u00famping. Hay que se\u00f1alar que, dado el valor unitario de los productos, tampoco es una medida que se pueda considerar descabellada, es un porcentaje relativamente peque\u00f1o.\nNo voy a entrar m\u00e1s en el tema d\u00famping. Sin embargo, en calidad de Presidente de la Comisi\u00f3n de Comercio Internacional, s\u00ed querr\u00eda hacer algunas consideraciones partiendo de un concepto inicial, y es la necesidad de respetar, en el marco de la OMC, las normas que nos hemos dado, tanto dentro como fuera de la Comunidad. Soy consciente de que se trata de algo m\u00e1s que de un simple caso de d\u00famping. Se plantea, en algunos casos, la superviviencia del sector en Europa y tambi\u00e9n la posibilidad de que la deslocalizaci\u00f3n sea una respuesta adecuada a la evoluci\u00f3n. Como saben, en estos casos todo el mundo tiene sus razones; ahora, no es concebible que toda la industria europea se desplace hacia el exterior.\nAl mismo tiempo, hay que se\u00f1alar que China est\u00e1 tratando de obtener un estatus de econom\u00eda de mercado en el marco de la OMC. Hay aspectos relacionados con las investigaciones comunitarias que se\u00f1alan que, en este caso, China no ha cumplido claramente con las obligaciones de cara a la OMC, tanto en el terreno de las subvenciones, m\u00e1s o menos encubiertas, como en el terreno de las falsificaciones. Por ello, se\u00f1or Comisario, esta es una oportunidad para demostrar a los ciudadanos que la Comisi\u00f3n va a hacer todo lo que est\u00e9 en su poder para asegurar que las normas comerciales sean respetadas, incluyendo, si ello fuera necesario, el recurso al \u00f3rgano de soluci\u00f3n de diferencias en la OMC.\nEstas distorsiones del mercado no se limitan al sector del cazado. Existen fundadas sospechas del car\u00e1cter habitual de ciertas intervenciones ilegales de apoyo a las empresas exportadoras chinas. Se\u00f1or Comisario, teniendo en cuenta las expectativas de la industria afectada y la sensibilidad de la opini\u00f3n p\u00fablica europea, quisiera saber qu\u00e9 acciones emprender\u00e1 la Comisi\u00f3n para asegurar que las reglas de la OMC ser\u00e1n respetadas por este pa\u00eds. Las consideraciones pol\u00edticas no debe prevalecer sobre las conclusiones t\u00e9cnicas en un caso de antid\u00famping. Las medidas que usted ha propuesto son controvertidas. La industria europea y ciertos Estados miembros no est\u00e1n satisfechos con su propuesta. Son p\u00fablicas las objeciones a la \"creatividad\" mostrada por la Comisi\u00f3n en la aplicaci\u00f3n de sus bien establecidas normas y pr\u00e1cticas en materia de antid\u00famping. No s\u00e9 si estas alegaciones son ciertas. Lo que s\u00ed s\u00e9 es que las investigaciones antid\u00famping est\u00e1n basadas en leyes que deben aplicarse fielmente sin ning\u00fan tipo de consideraciones paralelas.\nLe puedo se\u00f1alar en conclusi\u00f3n, se\u00f1or Comisario, que la Comisi\u00f3n de Comercio Internacional del Parlamento Europeo va a seguir muy de cerca todo este proceso, porque creemos que el paso que ha dado la Comisi\u00f3n es un paso inicial, pero que debe completarse con una actitud favorable a que China u otros pa\u00edses, como Viet nam, puedan tener m\u00e1s posibilidades en el comercio internacional, pero respetando conjuntamente las reglas que nos hemos dado.", "agenda_item": "State of the European footwear sector one year after liberalisation (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060314-ITEM-015", "intervention_id": "2-171", "summary_english": "```json\n{\n  \"headline\": \"MEP Calls for Strict Enforcement of WTO Rules Following Massive Import Surge and Dumping in European Footwear Sector\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"The speaker addresses the dramatic impact of trade liberalization on the European footwear sector, highlighting a massive surge in imports (particularly from China) with increases exceeding 450% and up to 900% in some cases.

Mr President, in response to the very welcome questions, let me stress that I am strongly committed to developing the two-way trade and investment relationship between Europe and China and with other Asian markets, including Vietnam. There is no greater prize, in my view, for European trade policy in the coming years than the prize of getting those relationships right.\nI believe that Europe must respect and adjust to the natural advantages those economies have, shifting our own focus to sectors and to products where our own skills and technologies give us the edge. That is how trade grows and that is how Europe\u2019s economies have grown over centuries.\nThe European footwear industry is in the front line of global competition. For all their ingenuity, creativity and excellence, Europe\u2019s leather-shoe makers are faced with an extraordinary challenge from Asia\u2019s producers. However, the case of dumping requires me to distinguish between this tough new competition, on the one hand, and genuinely unfair trade on the other.\nEurope\u2019s trade defence measures target unfair trade. They cannot protect us from tough competition. They cannot shield us from Asia\u2019s natural and legitimate low-cost advantages. However, when those comparative advantages are topped up by unfair and uncompetitive practice, we have a right and an obligation to act. That is why, having been presented with a preliminary analysis and assessment by my services, I have recommended to the Commission and to Member States provisional duties in this case.\nThere is clear evidence of serious state intervention in the leather footwear sector in China and Vietnam: cheap finance, tax breaks, non-market land rents and improper asset valuation leading to dumping. That dumping is causing serious injury to EU producers.\nThe dumping duties that I am recommending will ensure that retailers with goods in transit are not suddenly faced with unexpected costs at the border. I am suggesting that they be phased in over a period of five months, beginning at about 4% in April. It means that importers can plan ahead over the next six months with a maximum of transparency and predictability. It nevertheless means that after six months the full duty will be in place and the damaging effects of dumping will be counteracted.\nAs I am required by law to do, I have pondered the question of consumer and retailer interest in this case very seriously. I have proposed to exclude high-tech sports shoes which are no longer produced in significant numbers in Europe. I also propose to exclude children\u2019s shoes so as to be sure that even small price rises are not passed on to poorer families.\nI know that some are worried about the possible impact on consumer prices. I believe, on the basis of the facts, that there is a margin within the supply chain to absorb a small duty on import costs by spreading it across product ranges and the distribution chain. As I have said, these are proposals for provisional measures. They will be discussed with Member States and must be confirmed by the College of Commissioners.\nI believe that I am proposing a balanced solution that deserves the backing of Member States and this House. It corrects the injury but allows maximum predictability for importers and passes on minimal additional costs to consumers. There will be no quotas, no limit at all on imports of leather shoes from China and Vietnam. I have told the Chinese and Vietnamese Governments that I want to work with them to see how they can address the concerns raised by the EU investigation.\nImposing a duty on dumped goods is not protectionism. It is not a question of asking consumers to subsidise uncompetitive European producers, because the easy comparison is too often made. It is also worth being clear that shoes are not the next textiles. The textile issue concerned fairly-traded textile imports. Our proposed anti-dumping measures on leather shoes tackle, in contrast, unfair competition. The Commission has a legal obligation to investigate such a claim and a legal right to protect European producers against such practice.\nSome of your questions address the overall situation in the European footwear sector. Let me address this briefly. The contraction of the footwear sector is a long-term process that began long before trade in footwear with China was liberalised in 2005. Nonetheless, it is clear that there have been winners and losers from this change. Some producers have increased their exports and others, including Turkey and some of the ACP countries, have seen their exports to the EU and elsewhere hold steady or fall.\nClearly, it is China, equipped with a staggering production and export capacity, that has benefited most. Here in Europe, more than 40\u00a0000 footwear jobs have been lost and more than 1\u00a0000 footwear companies have closed down since 2001. European production of leather shoes has fallen by 30% and profit margins have been heavily squeezed to just over 1%.\nHowever, we should not pretend that this intense competitive pressure on European footwear producers is related solely to dumped goods. In large part, these are the consequences of changing production and consumption patterns in the global economy. I believe we should accept this, while helping those affected to adjust to these changes. We should also acknowledge that European producers have significantly contributed to the change by relocating their production to Asia in quite a number of cases. As a result, we need to take into account a range of European producer interests in assessing our interests in this matter.\nRising to the Asian challenge places great demands on our businesses and workers. The Commission\u2019s growth and job strategy is built on the idea that Europe must commit itself to equipping today\u2019s Europeans to respond to this challenge and to create tomorrow\u2019s jobs. We cannot block globalisation and economic change. I do not believe it is in Europe\u2019s interests to try. Those who think that the Trade Commissioner can reverse global economic change are asking King Canute to hold back the tide.\nHowever, we can shape globalisation, even harness its dynamic potential for renewal and, indeed, for innovation in Europe. I believe that the broader footwear issue confronts us with that imperative. We must invest in change, invest in those affected by change, but face up to the changing world in doing so. We must also be robust in our defence of the rules and of fair competition. We need to recognise that if we want to win the wider political argument for free trade, we must be ready to defend and stand up for fair trade.\nHowever, we cannot deny Asia its comparative advantages or the competitive industry that is lifting hundreds of millions in the developing world out of poverty. The only sustainable balance to that competition is the creativity, innovation and commitment of European companies themselves, reinforced with the appropriate help from political authorities.\nI am happy to return to any of these points in detail and to answer points that any Member may subsequently raise.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Peter Mandelson, Member of the Commission .

There has been a sharp rise in imports, with the consequences that that entails for European manufacturing sector.\nThis new situation makes it all the more necessary to monitor the ongoing restructuring process in the footwear sector, whereby the business world must be encouraged to adapt, and the economic structure of the regions most directly affected by the social impact of the ongoing changes must be rearranged. At the same time, however, the Commission must commit itself to detecting and combating glaring examples of unfair competition, which is exacerbating an already problematic situation. Unfair competition is the biggest ally of protectionist impulses. The EU must take a particularly strong lead in this area.\nIn this context, we should welcome the Commission\u2019s decision to adopt anti-dumping measures, after it emerged that China and Vietnam had resorted to unfair practices, such as the artificially low pricing of its exports in this sector. Such practices are especially unacceptable in view of the fact that these countries already enjoy extraordinary advantages over their competitors. There is therefore no justification for any kind of manipulative approach.\nAlthough the adopted measures are broadly welcome, we do have one or two concerns. The gradual implementation of anti-dumping rights, from a low starting point, may lead to an immediate increase in advance imports from China and Vietnam, which would make the current situation much worse. This is a serious concern.

It is the product of unfair practices in violation of the rules of international trade on the part of China and Vietnam, on the part of two emerging economies.\nAs other Members said, we lost thousands of jobs and hundreds of productive units disappeared in the European textile industry yesterday and today it will be the shoe industry. The European Union needs to send a clear message, as you intimated Commissioner, and we are all with you in this message. We are behind you. Yes to competition, no to its evident or concealed distortion. The anti-dumping duties \u2013 and this should be understood \u2013 are not a protective measure; they are a measure of legal commercial defence and, if this measure is to be effective, the duties must be proportionate to the degree of dumping.\nTo all those who use the better price argument against the imposition of duties, I would counter with the following question: have consumers benefited from the reduction in import prices following liberalisation? My personal opinion is that the few suppliers of products from China and Vietnam have benefited. The Commission should organise its institutional attack, an attack of systematic convergence and effective protection of intellectual and industrial property, an attack against ecological and social dumping, against opaque and unfair practices and state interventions. Otherwise, the accumulation of experiences of violation of the rules of international trade, with the Union reacting after the event, may jeopardise the confidence of European citizens in the fundamental principle of the liberalisation of the world trade system.", "lang": "EL", "original": "\u0393\u03b5\u03ce\u03c1\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a0\u03b1\u03c0\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03bc\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 (PPE-DE). \u2013 \u039a\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03b5 \u03a0\u03c1\u03cc\u03b5\u03b4\u03c1\u03b5, \u03b1\u03bd\u03ae\u03ba\u03c9 \u03c3\u03b5 \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c5\u03c0\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03c1\u03af\u03b6\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03bc\u03b5 \u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03ad\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 \u03ad\u03bd\u03b1 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03c5\u03bc\u03b5\u03c1\u03ad\u03c2, \u03b9\u03c3\u03bf\u03c1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03b7\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03cd\u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf \u03c0\u03b1\u03b3\u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u03b9\u03bf \u03b5\u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03c3\u03cd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1. \u0395\u03bd\u03bd\u03bf\u03ce \u03ad\u03bd\u03b1 \u03c3\u03cd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03c1\u03af\u03b6\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c3\u03b5 \u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03bc\u03b7 \u03c0\u03b9\u03bf \u03b1\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2, \u03c3\u03b5 \u03c0\u03b9\u03bf \u03b5\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03c7\u03c5\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2, \u03c3\u03b5 \u03c0\u03b9\u03bf \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5\u03af\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ad\u03c2 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03c3\u03af\u03b5\u03c2.\n\u0397 \u03b1\u03cd\u03be\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03b5\u03b9\u03c3\u03b1\u03b3\u03c9\u03b3\u03ce\u03bd \u03c3\u03c4\u03b1 \u03b4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bc\u03ac\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1 \u03c5\u03c0\u03bf\u03b4\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 \u03ad\u03c9\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 500% \u03c4\u03bf 2005 \u2013\u03bf \u03ba.

The Commission remains silent on this matter and does not seem keen to assess the impact of the damage done by this liberalisation.\nFollowing the complaint lodged by the operators in this sector, you opened an antidumping inquiry. The alarming results of that inquiry bring to light unquestionable evidence of state intervention and of social dumping practices, which cause material loss to our industries.\nIn order to combat this distortion of the fundamental rules of international trade, you are proposing some measures to us today. I am worried, however, about the gradual entry into force of these antidumping laws over a five-month period, a precedent that I feel is inappropriate and legally questionable and will not be without pernicious effects. These laws should make it possible to eliminate either dumping or the losses it causes. In fact, the proposed progressive rates do not fulfil either of those two alternative conditions. What is more, the exclusion of children\u2019s shoes seems to me to be unjustified and incomprehensible. Your proposals could very quickly prove to be insufficient faced with the extent of the losses suffered by our businesses.\nOther initiatives could be taken to counter these unfair commercial practices. For example, it would be possible to open an inquiry in the framework of the provisional safeguard measures applicable to Chinese imports, measures that have the advantage of being simple and effective.\nIf the Member States asked you to take such initiatives, would the Commission envisage doing so? Might consideration be given, Commissioner, to assessing whether China is actually implementing WTO trade rules and complying with fair and equitable commercial practices, unlike the way in which it is patently violating WTO law? Your proposals are neither robust nor enlightened. After textiles last year and footwear now, which other sectors will have to be subjected to these unfair practices in the future?", "lang": "FR", "original": "Kader Arif (PSE). - Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, Monsieur le Commissaire, depuis la suppression du r\u00e9gime des quotas, l\u2019an dernier, les importations en provenance de la Chine ont, cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9voqu\u00e9, augment\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re spectaculaire: environ 500\u00a0%.\nCeci a de lourdes cons\u00e9quences sur la comp\u00e9titivit\u00e9 du secteur europ\u00e9en de la chaussure, qui, face \u00e0 cette d\u00e9ferlante d\u2019importations \u00e0 tr\u00e8s bas prix, conna\u00eet un nombre de faillites dramatique, sans compter les pertes d\u2019emplois qui les accompagnent.\nPar ailleurs, nos fournisseurs traditionnels, pays candidats et pays de la zone Euromed, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9vinc\u00e9s du march\u00e9 communautaire. La Commission reste muette \u00e0 ce sujet et ne semble pas vouloir \u00e9valuer l\u2019impact des dommages de cette lib\u00e9ralisation.\nSuite \u00e0 la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par les acteurs de cette fili\u00e8re, vous avez ouvert une enqu\u00eate antidumping. Ses r\u00e9sultats alarmants mettent au jour des preuves incontestables d\u2019interventions \u00e9tatiques et de pratiques de dumping social, avec un pr\u00e9judice mat\u00e9riel pour nos industries.\nPour lutter contre cette distorsion des r\u00e8gles \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires du commerce international, vous nous proposez aujourd\u2019hui des mesures. Je m\u2019inqui\u00e8te cependant de l\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur progressive de ces droits antidumping sur une p\u00e9riode de cinq mois, un pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent qui me semble peu opportun, juridiquement contestable et non exempt d\u2019effets pervers. Ces droits devraient permettre d\u2019\u00e9liminer ou le dumping ou le pr\u00e9judice. Or, les taux progressifs propos\u00e9s ne r\u00e9pondent \u00e0 aucune de ces deux conditions alternatives. Enfin, l\u2019exclusion des chaussures pour enfants me para\u00eet injustifi\u00e9e et incompr\u00e9hensible. Vos propositions pourraient, tr\u00e8s vite, se r\u00e9v\u00e9ler insuffisantes face \u00e0 l\u2019ampleur des pr\u00e9judices subis par nos entreprises.\nD\u2019autres initiatives pour contrer ces pratiques commerciales d\u00e9loyales pourraient \u00eatre prises, par exemple la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019ouvrir une enqu\u00eate dans le cadre du m\u00e9canisme de sauvegarde transitoire applicable aux importations chinoises, instrument qui a pour avantage d\u2019\u00eatre simple et efficace.\nSi les \u00c9tats membres vous en faisaient la demande, la Commission envisagerait-elle d\u2019y avoir recours?

Well-organised special interests are allowed again and again to impose customs duties in their pursuit of small profits, which turn into large costs for consumers.\nWhen the Commission introduced customs duties on TV sets, consumers had to pay SEK\u00a02.00 for every krona earned by the industry. In the case of the duties on bed linen from Pakistan, every krona that went to the manufacturers cost consumers SEK\u00a03.00. In the case of Norwegian salmon, matters were even worse: every krona earned by the salmon producers cost consumers as much as SEK\u00a070.00. The Commission is therefore failing to take sufficient account of consumers and, thus, of Community interests.\nNow, the process has begun of making the same mistake once more \u2013 in connection with shoes from China and Vietnam \u2013 but this time we know the cost of the policy in advance. The Danish Government conducted a study showing that the costs to consumers in the EU was eight times greater than manufacturers\u2019 profits and that, in total, the EU was losing more than SEK\u00a02.5 billion.\nFor Sweden, the figure is even more appalling. Each krona earned by Swedish manufacturers costs Swedish consumers SEK\u00a044.00. In total, Swedish consumers can count on paying almost SEK\u00a060 million more for their shoes. The only EU country in which the business is estimated to be profitable is Slovakia, where SEK\u00a0300\u00a0000 is estimated to be earned. It would be cheaper if we in the European Parliament were to pool our money, in that way preventing people from having to pay duties.\nTo be honest, I do not believe that that would be a mistake. In spite of everything, the Commission has consciously chosen to make comparisons with expensive shoes from Brazil and measured the increase in imports before the quota was abolished against that after the quota was abolished. Not a single factory has been given market economy status, in spite of its being acknowledged that factories buy leather and labour in a way that is adjusted to conditions in the market.

The globalisation fund now provides us with a means of dealing with the past, but what solutions do we have for the future? My initial reaction to this was that this is the same sort of protectionism that we find with regard to textiles, and that would be a bad thing, for we need free and fair access to markets throughout the world. That is important to our producers within the European Union, and it is important that we in the European Union should keep to the rules, just as we demand that our trading partners should do.\nAfter I had got my hands on more information, it became clear to me that this is not protectionism, but dumping, and it became clear to me that the measures you are putting in place are, technically speaking, better planned than those you took to deal with textiles back then, but I can also see that our actions, now as then, are inconsistent, and inconsistency will be seen by the Chinese as a sign of weakness. I can still see why we have taken sports shoes out of the procedure, but why have we done so with children\u2019s shoes? Either this is dumping that we are dealing with or it is not.\nI do not think it makes any sense whatever to argue on the basis of the effect on consumers, for in no way have they benefited from the reduced import prices over the past few years, and, when one considers that a shoe imported for EUR\u00a06.50 can retail for EUR\u00a0120, it becomes clear that there is no justification whatever for the importers' warnings of price increases, which, it is claimed, will be of the order of 20%.\nLet us take a look at the issue of China. What lies behind this dumping? One aspect I find deeply disturbing; businesses are unable to keep proper accounts or ensure proper management. That is part of the reason. On the other hand, though, I am also seriously worried about the ever-increasing role played by the state in dumping, about the unjustified prices for land, about the tax reliefs for export businesses, about the banks\u2019 unrecoverable loans, about the subsidised costs of raw materials, and about much else besides. It simply makes no sense, then, to do as some in the Commission seem to want to do, and recognise China as a market economy. Here too, we must be consistent.\nIn all these respects, I would like to see us, in future, demonstrating more consistency and making a better job of keeping to the rules.", "lang": "DE", "original": "Daniel Caspary (PPE-DE). \u2013 Herr Pr\u00e4sident, gesch\u00e4tzter Herr Kommissar! Es fehlt uns eine Strategie, wie sich die Europ\u00e4ische Union der Globalisierung stellt. Wir haben jetzt den Globalisierungsfonds f\u00fcr die Vergangenheitsbew\u00e4ltigung. Aber welche L\u00f6sungen haben wir f\u00fcr die Zukunft? Meine erste Reaktion auf diesen Fall war: Wir haben es mit Protektionismus wie beim Thema \u201eTextil\u201c zu tun. Das w\u00e4re schlecht, denn wir brauchen den freien und fairen Marktzugang weltweit. Er ist wichtig f\u00fcr unsere Produzenten innerhalb der Europ\u00e4ischen Union. Und es ist wichtig, dass wir als Europ\u00e4ische Union die Regeln einhalten, denn wir verlangen das von den anderen Handelspartnern auch.\nNachdem ich mehr Informationen bekommen hatte, wurde mir klar, dass es kein Protektionismus, sondern Dumping ist. Und mir wurde klar, dass die Ma\u00dfnahmen, die Sie ergreifen, technisch viel besser angelegt sind als damals bei den Textilien. Aber mir wurde ebenfalls klar, dass unsere Ma\u00dfnahmen wieder inkonsequent sind, und Inkonsequenz wird uns von den Chinesen als Schw\u00e4che ausgelegt werden. Warum wir die Sportschuhe aus dem Verfahren ausgeschlossen haben, macht noch Sinn. Aber warum nehmen wir die Kinderschuhe aus? Entweder es ist Dumping oder nicht.\nMit den Auswirkungen auf die Verbraucher bei den Kinderschuhen zu argumentieren, macht aus meiner Sicht \u00fcberhaupt keinen Sinn, denn von den Importpreissenkungen der letzten Jahre haben die Verbraucher \u00fcberhaupt nicht profitiert. Und wenn man sich anschaut, dass bei einem Importpreis von 6,50 Euro der gleiche Schuh im Endpreis 120 Euro kosten kann, dann wird deutlich, dass auch die angeblichen Preissteigerungen von 20\u00a0%, vor denen die Importeure warnen, vollkommen ungerechtfertigt sind.\nSchauen wir uns das Thema \u201eChina\u201c an. Was sind die Ursachen des Dumpingfalls? Einerseits habe ich da gro\u00dfe Unruhe. Die Unternehmen sind nicht in der Lage, sauber Buchhaltung zu f\u00fchren oder f\u00fcr eine saubere Leitung zu sorgen. Das ist ein Teil der Begr\u00fcndung. Aber auf der anderen Seite mache ich mir auch gro\u00dfe Sorgen \u00fcber den immer gr\u00f6\u00dferen staatlichen Anteil am Dumping, \u00fcber nicht gerechtfertigte Grundst\u00fcckspreise, \u00fcber Steuererm\u00e4\u00dfigungen f\u00fcr Exportunternehmen, faule Kredite der Banken, Rohstoffkosten, die subventioniert werden, und vieles anderes. Daher macht es einfach keinen Sinn, in diesem Zusammenhang China \u2013 wie es Teile der Kommission scheinbar wollen \u2013 den Markwirtschaftsstatus zuzuerkennen.

Mr President, if you do not mind I shall not go along the course of answering the point about bed linen at this precise moment. In the time I have available I think it would be better to stick to shoes, but I can assure you that the question of any anti-dumping duty on bed linen will be properly assessed and properly applied as, in my opinion, it is at the moment.\nI think that the value of debates such as this and the important role of this Parliament are demonstrated by the very important and insightful observations that have been made during the last 45 minutes. My role on behalf of the Commission is to listen to what honourable Members have to say and to reflect very carefully on the points and arguments that have been raised. I can assure you I will reflect on them and on the observations made by Member States so that when I come back to the Commission with final recommendations I will be able to do so having heard the variety, diversity and range of different points and arguments that have been made.\nHowever, having heard so many people this afternoon complain that my intervention is protectionist, unnecessary and unjustified, alongside a slightly greater number of Members of this House who have complained that I am not going far enough, my actions are inadequate and that I should go further, I am tempted to make the easy observation that perhaps I have got the measures just about right between those two rival points of view! However, tempting as it is to make that rather cheap observation, I am going to avoid doing so.\nI should like to say, though, that I agree particularly with Mr Papastamkos and Mrs Sa\u00effi, both of whom see the need to intervene against anti-competitive and trade-distorting behaviour by our partners, but at the same time to do so with a degree of perspective and balance that I think it behoves me to uphold. I think Mr Assis is right in that, in the provisional measures that are introduced, it is important that we maintain careful monitoring and surveillance of the effect of what we are doing so as to ensure that, if there is circumvention of our duties, we are able to review the situation and perhaps take revised action when we come to the definitive stage of our measures later this year.\nLet me very quickly respond to some of the other points that have been made.\nSome have drawn a parallel between the proposed action on shoes and the action that we took on textiles. They are very different cases. In the case of textiles, we were dealing with fairly-traded goods, albeit subject to a dramatic and sudden increase in volume following the lifting of quotas on Chinese textiles at the beginning of 2005. We therefore took a safeguard measure by the introduction of quotas, as we are entitled to do. We were not, as in this case, dealing with anti-competitive measures \u2013 dumping actions \u2013 that attract an anti-dumping measure in the form of a tariff duty \u2013 not a quota and not a physical limit. Therefore I do not anticipate our running into the temporary teething problems that we had in the case of textiles. This should be remembered by those who describe the textile period as involving us in some sort of war or battle with China. Far from it. We were able to agree with China the measures that we took, in a very unwarlike way.\nTwo other points were raised by a number of Members. One concerns the impact on consumer prices. Let us put this case into perspective. It concerns only nine pairs of shoes from every 100 pairs bought by European consumers; in other words, a fraction of the product range. A duty would be just over EUR 1.50 on average wholesale prices of EUR\u00a08.50 on shoes which then sell for between EUR 40 and EUR 120, as opposed to a duty which would simply amount to EUR 1.50. Please do not tell me that EUR 1.50 cannot be absorbed across the supply chain by importers and retailers, especially importers and retailers who have benefited from low import prices from China and Vietnam but who have not passed on the effects of those cheaper import prices to consumers \u2013 a question that consumers may put to their retailers if they are able to encounter them at some stage in the future.\nA number of Members have asked me why I am proposing to exclude sports technology shoes and children\u2019s shoes. In the case of the sports shoes, these are excluded from the investigation because they are not produced in Europe in sufficient quantity to qualify as being potentially harmed by dumping. There is therefore no injury to European producers because they barely exist in the case of these sports shoes.\nIn the case of children\u2019s shoes, the exclusion I am proposing is on the grounds of Community interest. Young children need three to four pairs of new shoes per year. The impact of a duty on the price of such shoes is therefore potentially greater than it is for ordinary shoes.\nIn my view, parents should not see any potential hurdles put in the way of buying good-quality shoes for their children. Those who want me to reclassify the customs segmentation for these shoes should bear in mind that the customs classification for children is up to size 37\u00bd with heels less than 3cm. Whilst I am prepared to discuss that with my colleagues in TAXUD, it is a classification that I am given, not one that I propose.\nLet me make just briefly one or two other quick observations. There was a suggestion that the investigation had taken too long. This sampling takes time. I am obliged by the regulations that exist within the European Community to observe very strict procedures and use very strict reference countries and companies when I am investigating those of another country that does not enjoy market economy status.\nTherefore, just as I cannot anticipate dumping complaints \u2013 some Members were complaining that I do not show enough foresight, as if I have a crystal ball before me that is going to reveal where the next dumping complaint is going to come from \u2013 I cannot pre-empt proper procedures and investigations that are laid out in our regulations and which I am obliged to follow in detail.\nLet me reply to the suggestion that somehow there was a breach of confidentiality. I do not understand this. Member States received the Commission\u2019s working document before my press conference on 23\u00a0February. The moment these working documents go out to Member States I can assure you that they are as good as published to the media. I therefore have to clarify them immediately and explain and justify what I am doing. This certainly does not deprive Member States of their right to express an opinion on the case or to receive detailed replies from the Commission\u2019s services.\nI shall leave the matter there, except to say in conclusion that it is very important that we see what is happening in China, Vietnam, India and other Asian countries in some perspective. Of course there is tough competition and there is a difficult challenge for European producers and manufacturers to rise to, and we have an obligation to do everything we can to help European producers rise to this challenge and to help those employed in companies adjust to the challenges and the new circumstances of international trade which we are experiencing. I do not believe that a proper and legitimate way of helping people to adjust to these new forces in the global economy is to encourage people to shelter from them or to pretend that, if we close our eyes or cover our heads with a blanket, these changes, challenges and new sources of competition will somehow go away and leave us alone so that we do not have to respond to them.\nAny politician giving that sort of message to the public would be guilty of false leadership, and poor leadership to the public, who need to understand what is going on and help to respond to it. We cannot maintain the pretence that we in Europe, by retreating from the competitive challenge we are facing in the global economy, will somehow be able to hide from it and, at the same time, maintain our living standards and our prosperity in the future. We cannot and will not do that.\nWe have to respond to this challenge by putting the emphasis on our competitiveness, innovation and ability to respond to change and to compete more effectively in the future. If we do not rise to that challenge and do not set that out to our public, we cannot blame them subsequently for reacting with fear and mystification to what is taking place in the global economy.\n(Applause)", "lang": "EN", "original": "Peter Mandelson, Member of the Commission .

I am obliged by the regulations that exist within the European Community to observe very strict procedures and use very strict reference countries and companies when I am investigating those of another country that does not enjoy market economy status.\nTherefore, just as I cannot anticipate dumping complaints \u2013 some Members were complaining that I do not show enough foresight, as if I have a crystal ball before me that is going to reveal where the next dumping complaint is going to come from \u2013 I cannot pre-empt proper procedures and investigations that are laid out in our regulations and which I am obliged to follow in detail.\nLet me reply to the suggestion that somehow there was a breach of confidentiality. I do not understand this. Member States received the Commission\u2019s working document before my press conference on 23\u00a0February. The moment these working documents go out to Member States I can assure you that they are as good as published to the media. I therefore have to clarify them immediately and explain and justify what I am doing. This certainly does not deprive Member States of their right to express an opinion on the case or to receive detailed replies from the Commission\u2019s services.\nI shall leave the matter there, except to say in conclusion that it is very important that we see what is happening in China, Vietnam, India and other Asian countries in some perspective. Of course there is tough competition and there is a difficult challenge for European producers and manufacturers to rise to, and we have an obligation to do everything we can to help European producers rise to this challenge and to help those employed in companies adjust to the challenges and the new circumstances of international trade which we are experiencing. I do not believe that a proper and legitimate way of helping people to adjust to these new forces in the global economy is to encourage people to shelter from them or to pretend that, if we close our eyes or cover our heads with a blanket, these changes, challenges and new sources of competition will somehow go away and leave us alone so that we do not have to respond to them.\nAny politician giving that sort of message to the public would be guilty of false leadership, and poor leadership to the public, who need to understand what is going on and help to respond to it. We cannot maintain the pretence that we in Europe, by retreating from the competitive challenge we are facing in the global economy, will somehow be able to hide from it and, at the same time, maintain our living standards and our prosperity in the future. We cannot and will not do that.\nWe have to respond to this challenge by putting the emphasis on our competitiveness, innovation and ability to respond to change and to compete more effectively in the future. If we do not rise to that challenge and do not set that out to our public, we cannot blame them subsequently for reacting with fear and mystification to what is taking place in the global economy.\n(Applause)", "agenda_item": "State of the European footwear sector one year after liberalisation (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060314-ITEM-015", "intervention_id": "2-196", "summary_english": "```json\n{\n  \"headline\": \"Commission defends balanced approach on anti-dumping duties for Chinese and Vietnamese shoes while emphasizing need for European competitiveness\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"The speaker addresses concerns about anti-dumping measures on footwear imports from China and Vietnam, defending the Commission's provisional measures against criticism from both protectionist and free-trade perspectives.

Debate Information\n\n**Topic:** State of the European footwear sector one year after liberalisation  \n**Date:** Not specified in the provided materials  \n**Contributions:** 35 speakers participated in this European Parliament debate  \n**Context:** Assessment of the impact of trade liberalisation on the European footwear sector, particularly focusing on massive import increases from China and Vietnam and the Commission's proposed anti-dumping measures\n\n## 2. Executive Summary\n\n### Key Issues Identified\n\nThe debate centered on the dramatic consequences of footwear market liberalisation, with speakers highlighting massive import increases from China (400-900% in some cases) and Vietnam, resulting in over 40,000 job losses, 1,000 company closures since 2001, and a 30% decline in European leather shoe production. Enrique Bar\u00f3n Crespo emphasized that \"it is inconceivable that the entire European industry should move out\" while noting the sector employs over 500,000 workers across mainly SMEs.\n\n### Commission's Response\n\nCommissioner Peter Mandelson defended the Commission's balanced approach, proposing provisional anti-dumping duties of 19.4% for China and 16.8% for Vietnam, with exclusions for high-tech sports shoes and children's footwear. He argued that \"imposing a duty on dumped goods is not protectionism\" but rather addresses unfair state intervention including \"cheap finance, tax breaks, and non-market land rents.\"\n\n### Divided Parliamentary Positions\n\n**Supporters of Stronger Protection:** Several MEPs, including Cristiana Muscardini, Tokia Sa\u00effi, and Kader Arif, argued the proposed measures were insufficient. Muscardini contended \"the level of protection laid down in the proposal is too low, and is inadequate, especially if it is spread over six months.\" Francisco Assis warned that \"gradual implementation of anti-dumping rights, from a low starting point, may lead to an immediate increase in advance imports.\"\n\n**Critics of Protectionism:** Christofer Fjellner strongly opposed the measures, citing economic evidence that \"each krona earned by Swedish manufacturers costs Swedish consumers SEK 44.00,\" arguing consumer costs vastly outweigh industry benefits. Syed Kamall similarly argued that \"European citizens are voting with their wallets and buying imported footwear\" and that duties would \"punish consumers by increasing the price they pay.\"\n\n**Moderate Positions:** David Martin supported the Commission's approach as striking \"the right balance,\" while Robert Sturdy expressed concerns about consistency, questioning whether \"we are going to be protective of the European shoe industry.\"\n\n### Key Arguments\n\n**Unfair Competition Claims:** Multiple speakers, including Johan Van Hecke and Georgios Papastamkos, argued China \"is keen to enjoy the benefits of WTO membership but overlooks the obligations that this entails.\" Caroline Lucas highlighted that Chinese workers earn \"around $12 per week\" creating a \"race to the bottom in costs and standards.\"\n\n**Economic Impact Concerns:** Ryszard Czarnecki noted that Asian \"production in the sector we are discussing has nothing in common with the free market, as the local labour force is cheap in the extreme.\" Patrick Louis cited specific regional impacts, noting Romans, France had \"unemployment rate stands at 18% \u2013 twice the French average \u2013 because the footwear sector there is devastated.\"\n\n### Proposals and Recommendations\n\n**Immediate Measures:** Several speakers called for faster implementation without gradual phase-ins, with Giulietto Chiesa proposing \"duties should be applied immediately, not in a few months' time.\" Elisa Ferreira argued \"given that we know dumping takes place, it makes no sense to allow it to be tolerated.\"\n\n**Broader Policy Changes:** Vittorio Agnoletto called for \"a wholesale rethink of WTO laissez-faire doctrines,\" while Bastiaan Belder proposed developing \"a solid and unambiguous trade policy with the Asian region\" to prevent recurring sectoral conflicts.\n\n**Alternative Approaches:** Some speakers suggested different strategies, with Erika Mann proposing \"an overall assessment of competition conditions and state intervention in China\" and consideration of \"WTO action if China and Vietnam do not stop unfair practices.\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe debate revealed fundamental tensions between free trade principles and protecting European industry from what many considered unfair competition. While there was broad agreement on the existence of dumping practices, parliamentarians remained divided on the appropriate response, with the Commission's compromise approach satisfying neither strong protectionists nor free trade advocates completely. The discussion highlighted broader challenges of managing globalization's impact on traditional European manufacturing sectors.", "src_model": "claude", "model_type": "claude", "model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "structured": true, "incremental": false, "hierarchical": false, "grouped": false, "shuffle": false, "prompt": false, "lang": "english"}
