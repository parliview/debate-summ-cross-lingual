{"speaker": "Robert Sturdy,", "english": "Robert Sturdy, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . \u2013 Mr President, I am a little bit worried that we, and the Commission in particular, have not learned anything from the problem of the \u2018bra wars\u2019, as they became known, when we had to readjust our position. I fully understand the situation on anti-dumping measures and agree entirely with the Commission\u2019s outlook on it. However, Commissioner, you said one or two things in your speech which concern me.\nYou said that, when you looked at Vietnam and China, there were circumstances where they had financing, special financial agreements and tax breaks etc. Does that never apply in some cases in the European Union? Are there not cases where this quite often happens in the European Union? In particular, have European funding, structural funds, etc. never been used? Would there be a risk of us perhaps being taken to the WTO on the extent of anti-dumping measures or support?\nCould you also answer one or two other questions? I understand the situation with China very clearly and I would accept your position, but one of the things that we are trying to do in the Western world at the moment is make poverty history. This is something that we have been talking about quite a lot. However, Vietnam, 30 years ago and even 10 years ago, was a very poor country, probably poorer than many sub-Saharan African countries. Why have they had the need? Surely they have been able to compete without actually putting in a support mechanism? Could you answer that? This is a country which has dragged itself from being one of the poorest and now at least has some sort of infrastructure.\nI am concerned that we are going to be protective of the European shoe industry. You say not. However, I still feel concerned.\nI should like you to answer one final question. I think we as MEPs and you as the Commission have missed an opportunity to get the message across about dumping. People see us as being protectionist. Your staff told me that a pair of designer boots from China cost about EUR\u00a0180 in Europe and yet only EUR\u00a010 coming from China. If the effect of the 19% is passed directly on to the consumer, will the 19% be calculated on the EUR\u00a0180 or on the EUR\u00a010 that it costs to bring them in?", "lang": "EN", "original": "Robert Sturdy, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . \u2013 Mr President, I am a little bit worried that we, and the Commission in particular, have not learned anything from the problem of the \u2018bra wars\u2019, as they became known, when we had to readjust our position.
