{"speaker": "Erika Mann,", "english": "Erika Mann, on behalf of the PSE Group . \u2013 Mr President, I have a few questions and I will not be able to speak on behalf of my group in this case because, as with the anti-dumping cases, I think we are pretty much divided and have our own views on this issue. Nevertheless, I want to thank the Commissioner for presenting his point of view and for intervening.\nMy starting point is that the anti-dumping measures and instruments need to be taken quite seriously. On that point, I support my colleague Mr Sturdy, who is right. If we do not use the instrument in a transparent and fair way it could become quite complicated for us.\nMy first question to the Commissioner is: will the EU produce an overall assessment of the conditions of competition and state intervention in the People\u2019s Republic of China? The European Parliament would also like to receive a report on China\u2019s compliance with WTO rules and accession commitment five years after its accession to the WTO.\nWould the EC take WTO action if China and Vietnam do not stop their unfair actions within a reasonable period of time and what would these measures be?\nCommissioner, do you agree that the EC agreement and the results of the AD investigations are confidential and that leaks of information may lead to market distortions? Could you explain in detail the rationale behind the exclusion of children\u2019s footwear, especially in view of the fact that in some countries children\u2019s footwear is worn by adults? Could you explain why the publication of the results of the anti-surveillance system were so delayed? If I am not completely mistaken, it was one year. One small point: how do you see this investigation relating to another evaluation which is currently being undertaken as regards giving China market economy status?", "lang": "EN", "original": "Erika Mann, on behalf of the PSE Group . \u2013 Mr President, I have a few questions and I will not be able to speak on behalf of my group in this case because, as with the anti-dumping cases, I think we are pretty much divided and have our own views on this issue.
