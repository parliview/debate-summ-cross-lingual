{"speaker": "Giulietto Chiesa (ALDE). \u2013", "english": "Giulietto Chiesa (ALDE). \u2013 (IT) Mr\u00a0Mandelson, ladies and gentlemen, the Italian situation in the footwear sector prompts me to call for a significant change to the measures proposed by you and in part accepted by the Italian Government. Italy is already paying very high prices in terms of employment.\nMine is a request not in the name of protectionism, but in the name of a calculation of the social impact. It is not a case of affirming or refusing globalisation or the market, and its analysis is measured, in theoretical terms, and also realistic. It is a question of emphases: the path between heaven and hell is a narrow one. Just as there is a fine distinction, as you have said once again here, between tough competition and unfair competition.\nI base myself on your words: China and Vietnam have broken the rules. You propose to react, but the dimensions of the dumping seem rather greater than the duties that you propose. I think, quite frankly, that your measures should be revised, with changes to both the figures and the deadlines. In other words, duties should be applied immediately, not in a few months\u2019 time, and they should be increased, by also excluding high-tech sports shoes from the exemption on duties . Otherwise, neither European producers\u2019 nor European consumers\u2019 interests will be protected, nor will the market be well served.", "lang": "IT", "original": "Giulietto Chiesa (ALDE). \u2013 Signor Commissario, onorevoli colleghi, l\u2019esame della situazione italiana del settore delle calzature mi induce a chiedere una modifica sostanziale delle misure da lei proposte e in parte accettate dal governo italiano. L\u2019Italia sta gi\u00e0 pagando prezzi altissimi in termini di occupazione.\nLa mia \u00e8 una richiesta non in nome del protezionismo, ma di un calcolo degli effetti sociali. Non si tratta di affermare o di negare la globalizzazione o il mercato, la sua analisi \u00e8 teoricamente misurata e anche realistica. Si tratta di una questione di accenti: il sentiero fra il paradiso e l\u2019inferno \u00e8 stretto. Stretto come poter distinguere, come lei ha qui ripetuto, tra una dura concorrenza e una concorrenza sleale.\nMi baso sulle sue parole: Cina e Vietnam hanno violato le regole. Lei propone di reagire, ma le proporzioni del dumping sembrano assai superiori a quelle dei dazi che lei propone. Penso francamente che le sue misure debbano essere rinegoziate, cambiando sia i valori che i tempi, cio\u00e8 applicazione immediata dei dazi, non tra qualche mese, e il loro innalzamento escludendo dall\u2019esenzione daziaria le scarpe anche quelle di tipo staff.
