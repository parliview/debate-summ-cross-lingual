They will finally be crushed by the unfair competition of goods at the very lowest prices, produced without any proper monitoring of the conditions in the production and distribution chain, either with regard to environmental impact or the social security benefits and employment benefits enjoyed by the labour force.\nThese are the factors of production on which the business costs advantage operates, unfairly distorting every competitive capacity and transforming it into, instead of the free operation of the market, open dumping that runs counter to the interests not only of one sector, but of the entire Community.\nI ask for the Commission to take action to defend the footwear sector against unfair competition from products imported from countries outside the EU, partly in the light of the fact that the monitoring measures so far taken by the EU have proved, in practice, to be useless.\nWe are calling not just for vigilance, but also for active defence of the special expertise and quality of the European footwear sector, through strict limits on imports, the imposition of duties and the certification of the social and environmental ethical qualities of products, as I have already requested on other occasions.", "lang": "IT", "original": "Luca Romagnoli (NI). \u2013 Signor Commissario, onorevoli colleghi, siamo alle solite: dopo aver abolito ogni restrizione sulle importazioni di prodotti calzaturieri dall\u2019Estremo Oriente e aver cos\u00ec danneggiato l\u2019industria europea e italiana del settore con le ovvie ricadute occupazionali, si stanno gettando le basi della futura e certa compromissione delle sorti delle piccole e medie imprese.
