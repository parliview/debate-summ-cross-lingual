{"speaker": "Elisa Ferreira (PSE). \u2013", "english": "Elisa Ferreira (PSE). \u2013 (PT) I wish to begin by expressing my support for the proposal to adopt anti-dumping measures in the footwear sector. This was the least we could ask for given that dumping destroys the very essence of freedom of trade. Europe\u2019s industry must not die of apathy and of complicity with such practices.\nGiven the lack of time I shall limit myself to two remarks. Given that we know dumping takes place, it makes no sense to allow it to be tolerated. This is what will happen with the proposed gradual approach to implementing anti-dumping measures. There is no justification for this gradual approach.\nMy second remark is that excluding children\u2019s footwear is totally unacceptable. There is no justification, no legal basis and no technical foundation for such a move. To pursue this and other unjustified exclusions totally undermines the credibility of these measures. I therefore call for a complete rethink of these aspects.\nLastly, it is crucial that the Commission abandon its constantly reactive position and begin to achieve results in its political priority of opening up third-country markets for European footwear exports, and in particular the Japanese market, mechanisms of access to the Russian market and indeed the Chinese market.", "lang": "PT", "original": "Elisa Ferreira (PSE). \u2013 Come\u00e7o por apoiar a proposta de adop\u00e7\u00e3o de medidas anti-dumping no sector do cal\u00e7ado.
