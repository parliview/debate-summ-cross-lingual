{"speaker": "Kader Arif (PSE). \u2013", "english": "Kader Arif (PSE). \u2013 (FR) Mr\u00a0President, Commissioner, ever since the quota system was abolished last year, imports from China have, as has been mentioned, spectacularly increased by around 500%.\nThat has serious consequences for the competitiveness of the European footwear sector which, faced with this flood of very low-priced imports, is seeing a number of tragic bankruptcies, to say nothing of the job losses that go with them.\nFurthermore, our traditional suppliers in the form of candidate countries and countries in the Euromed area have been ousted from the Community market. The Commission remains silent on this matter and does not seem keen to assess the impact of the damage done by this liberalisation.\nFollowing the complaint lodged by the operators in this sector, you opened an antidumping inquiry. The alarming results of that inquiry bring to light unquestionable evidence of state intervention and of social dumping practices, which cause material loss to our industries.\nIn order to combat this distortion of the fundamental rules of international trade, you are proposing some measures to us today. I am worried, however, about the gradual entry into force of these antidumping laws over a five-month period, a precedent that I feel is inappropriate and legally questionable and will not be without pernicious effects. These laws should make it possible to eliminate either dumping or the losses it causes. In fact, the proposed progressive rates do not fulfil either of those two alternative conditions. What is more, the exclusion of children\u2019s shoes seems to me to be unjustified and incomprehensible. Your proposals could very quickly prove to be insufficient faced with the extent of the losses suffered by our businesses.\nOther initiatives could be taken to counter these unfair commercial practices. For example, it would be possible to open an inquiry in the framework of the provisional safeguard measures applicable to Chinese imports, measures that have the advantage of being simple and effective.\nIf the Member States asked you to take such initiatives, would the Commission envisage doing so? Might consideration be given, Commissioner, to assessing whether China is actually implementing WTO trade rules and complying with fair and equitable commercial practices, unlike the way in which it is patently violating WTO law? Your proposals are neither robust nor enlightened. After textiles last year and footwear now, which other sectors will have to be subjected to these unfair practices in the future?", "lang": "FR", "original": "Kader Arif (PSE). - Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, Monsieur le Commissaire, depuis la suppression du r\u00e9gime des quotas, l\u2019an dernier, les importations en provenance de la Chine ont, cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9voqu\u00e9, augment\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re spectaculaire: environ 500\u00a0%.\nCeci a de lourdes cons\u00e9quences sur la comp\u00e9titivit\u00e9 du secteur europ\u00e9en de la chaussure, qui, face \u00e0 cette d\u00e9ferlante d\u2019importations \u00e0 tr\u00e8s bas prix, conna\u00eet un nombre de faillites dramatique, sans compter les pertes d\u2019emplois qui les accompagnent.\nPar ailleurs, nos fournisseurs traditionnels, pays candidats et pays de la zone Euromed, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9vinc\u00e9s du march\u00e9 communautaire. La Commission reste muette \u00e0 ce sujet et ne semble pas vouloir \u00e9valuer l\u2019impact des dommages de cette lib\u00e9ralisation.\nSuite \u00e0 la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par les acteurs de cette fili\u00e8re, vous avez ouvert une enqu\u00eate antidumping. Ses r\u00e9sultats alarmants mettent au jour des preuves incontestables d\u2019interventions \u00e9tatiques et de pratiques de dumping social, avec un pr\u00e9judice mat\u00e9riel pour nos industries.\nPour lutter contre cette distorsion des r\u00e8gles \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires du commerce international, vous nous proposez aujourd\u2019hui des mesures. Je m\u2019inqui\u00e8te cependant de l\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur progressive de ces droits antidumping sur une p\u00e9riode de cinq mois, un pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent qui me semble peu opportun, juridiquement contestable et non exempt d\u2019effets pervers. Ces droits devraient permettre d\u2019\u00e9liminer ou le dumping ou le pr\u00e9judice. Or, les taux progressifs propos\u00e9s ne r\u00e9pondent \u00e0 aucune de ces deux conditions alternatives. Enfin, l\u2019exclusion des chaussures pour enfants me para\u00eet injustifi\u00e9e et incompr\u00e9hensible. Vos propositions pourraient, tr\u00e8s vite, se r\u00e9v\u00e9ler insuffisantes face \u00e0 l\u2019ampleur des pr\u00e9judices subis par nos entreprises.\nD\u2019autres initiatives pour contrer ces pratiques commerciales d\u00e9loyales pourraient \u00eatre prises, par exemple la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019ouvrir une enqu\u00eate dans le cadre du m\u00e9canisme de sauvegarde transitoire applicable aux importations chinoises, instrument qui a pour avantage d\u2019\u00eatre simple et efficace.\nSi les \u00c9tats membres vous en faisaient la demande, la Commission envisagerait-elle d\u2019y avoir recours? Est-il envisageable, Monsieur le Commissaire, de faire une \u00e9valuation de la mise en \u0153uvre effective des r\u00e8gles commerciales de l\u2019OMC par la Chine ainsi que du respect par celle-ci des pratiques commerciales \u00e9quitables et loyales, \u00e0 l\u2019inverse des violations patentes du droit de l\u2019OMC auxquelles elle se livre? Vos propositions ne sont ni fortes ni \u00e9clair\u00e9es.
