{"speaker": "Christofer Fjellner (PPE-DE). \u2013", "english": "Christofer Fjellner (PPE-DE). \u2013 (SV) Commissioner, EU history where anti-dumping is concerned is scary. Well-organised special interests are allowed again and again to impose customs duties in their pursuit of small profits, which turn into large costs for consumers.\nWhen the Commission introduced customs duties on TV sets, consumers had to pay SEK\u00a02.00 for every krona earned by the industry. In the case of the duties on bed linen from Pakistan, every krona that went to the manufacturers cost consumers SEK\u00a03.00. In the case of Norwegian salmon, matters were even worse: every krona earned by the salmon producers cost consumers as much as SEK\u00a070.00. The Commission is therefore failing to take sufficient account of consumers and, thus, of Community interests.\nNow, the process has begun of making the same mistake once more \u2013 in connection with shoes from China and Vietnam \u2013 but this time we know the cost of the policy in advance. The Danish Government conducted a study showing that the costs to consumers in the EU was eight times greater than manufacturers\u2019 profits and that, in total, the EU was losing more than SEK\u00a02.5 billion.\nFor Sweden, the figure is even more appalling. Each krona earned by Swedish manufacturers costs Swedish consumers SEK\u00a044.00. In total, Swedish consumers can count on paying almost SEK\u00a060 million more for their shoes. The only EU country in which the business is estimated to be profitable is Slovakia, where SEK\u00a0300\u00a0000 is estimated to be earned. It would be cheaper if we in the European Parliament were to pool our money, in that way preventing people from having to pay duties.\nTo be honest, I do not believe that that would be a mistake. In spite of everything, the Commission has consciously chosen to make comparisons with expensive shoes from Brazil and measured the increase in imports before the quota was abolished against that after the quota was abolished. Not a single factory has been given market economy status, in spite of its being acknowledged that factories buy leather and labour in a way that is adjusted to conditions in the market. I am seriously concerned about the increasing protectionism I encounter in the EU, and I hope that this is the last time the Commission gives way to the demands of protectionists at the expense of citizens.", "lang": "SV", "original": "Christofer Fjellner (PPE-DE). \u2013 Herr kommission\u00e4r! Unionens historia n\u00e4r det g\u00e4ller antidumpning f\u00f6rskr\u00e4cker. V\u00e4lorganiserade s\u00e4rintressen till\u00e5ts g\u00e5ng p\u00e5 g\u00e5ng genom tullar s\u00f6ka sm\u00e5 vinster som blir till stora kostnader f\u00f6r konsumenterna.\nN\u00e4r kommissionen introducerade tullar p\u00e5 tv-apparater fick konsumenterna betala tv\u00e5 kronor f\u00f6r varje krona som industrin tj\u00e4nade. Vid tullarna p\u00e5 pakistanska s\u00e4nglinnen gav varje krona f\u00f6r producenterna v\u00e5ra konsumenter en kostnad p\u00e5 tre kronor. I fallet med den norska laxen var det \u00e4nnu v\u00e4rre: d\u00e4r kostade varje krona som laxproducenterna tj\u00e4nade konsumenterna hela 70 kronor. Kommissionen missar konsekvent att ta tillr\u00e4cklig h\u00e4nsyn till konsumenterna och d\u00e4rmed gemenskapsintresset.\nNu \u00e4r man p\u00e5 v\u00e4g att g\u00f6ra om samma misstag en g\u00e5ng till \u2013 n\u00e4r det g\u00e4ller skor fr\u00e5n Kina och Vietnam \u2013 men den h\u00e4r g\u00e5ngen vet vi p\u00e5 f\u00f6rhand priset f\u00f6r politiken. Danska regeringen gjorde en studie som visade att kostnaderna f\u00f6r konsumenterna i unionen \u00e4r \u00e5tta g\u00e5nger st\u00f6rre \u00e4n vinsterna f\u00f6r producenterna, och totalt f\u00f6rlorar unionen \u00f6ver tv\u00e5 och en halv miljard kronor.\nF\u00f6r Sverige \u00e4r siffran \u00e4nnu l\u00e4skigare. Varje krona svenska producenter tj\u00e4nar kostar de svenska konsumenterna 44 kronor. Totalt ska de svenska konsumenterna r\u00e4kna med att betala n\u00e4stan 60 miljoner mer f\u00f6r sina skor. Det enda land i unionen d\u00e4r det ber\u00e4knas vara en vinstaff\u00e4r \u00e4r Slovakien. D\u00e4r ber\u00e4knas man tj\u00e4na 300 000 kronor. Det blir billigare om vi h\u00e4r i Europaparlamentet skramlar ihop pengarna, s\u00e5 slipper medborgarna p\u00e5lagan.\n\u00c4rligt talat tror jag inte att detta \u00e4r ett misstag.
