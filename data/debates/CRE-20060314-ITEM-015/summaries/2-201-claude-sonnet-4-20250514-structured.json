{"speaker": "Alessandro Battilocchio (NI). \u2013", "english": "Alessandro Battilocchio (NI). \u2013 (IT) I welcome the Commission\u2019s diligence in listening to the demands of small and medium-sized European enterprises worried by the increase in imports from non-EU countries, and the latest proposal for compensatory anti-dumping duties on leather shoes, against China and Vietnam. I believe, however, that the measures put forward are still totally inadequate given the severity of the issue. The duties proposed are inadequate because they are too low and therefore ineffective. The phasing-in period (six months) is inadequate, since it is a procedure that is too feeble for such a serious case of dumping. The exclusion of non-professional sports shoes and children\u2019s shoes (which can also include women\u2019s shoes) is also unacceptable.\nI would also point out that another fundamental request, which is the compulsory introduction of a label of origin for products entering the EU, has been dragging on for two years without the Member States being able to come to agreement.\nIt is also necessary to tackle the worrying increase in swap practices \u2013 in other words, anomalous movements of products with the aim of bypassing more stringent customs controls (imports from Belgium have increased by an amount of 17.8%, which is absolutely inexplicable). The calls by the Commission to make innovative changes are reasonable and interesting, but they make sense only in a genuinely equitable and fair competitive environment, and the Commission has a duty to ensure that the international market is just that.", "lang": "IT", "original": "Alessandro Battilocchio (NI). \u2013 Apprezzo l\u2019impegno della Commissione nell\u2019ascoltare le istanze delle PMI europee preoccupate dall\u2019incremento delle importazioni da paesi terzi, e l\u2019ultima proposta di dazi compensativi antidumping sulle calzature in pelle contro Cina e Vietnam. Ritengo tuttavia le misure proposte ancora profondamente inadeguate alla gravit\u00e0 della questione. Inadeguati i dazi proposti, troppo bassi e quindi inefficaci. Inadeguata la gradualit\u00e0 temporale (6 mesi), procedura troppo debole per un caso cosi grave di dumping . Inaccettabili inoltre le esclusioni delle calzature sportive non professionali e quelle da bambini (in cui possono rientrare anche quelle femminili).\nRicordo inoltre che un\u2019altra fondamentale richiesta, l\u2019introduzione obbligatoria del marchio di origine per i prodotti in entrata nella UE, si trascina da 2 anni senza riuscire a trovare un accordo tra i Paesi Membri.\nOccorre inoltre affrontare l\u2019inquietante l\u2019aumento delle \u201ctriangolazioni\u201d, ossia di movimenti anomali di prodotti con lo scopo di aggirare controlli doganali pi\u00f9 stringenti (le importazioni dal Belgio sono aumentate del 17,8 per cento in quantit\u00e0, cosa assolutamente inspiegabile).
