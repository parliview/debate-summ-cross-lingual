Now Beijing has learned the lesson and is not hesitating to apply the rules of the World Trade Organisation with a merciless resolution worthy of its masters.\nIt appears that the anti-dumping measures in no way comply with Community legislation or case-law and may have an extremely negative impact on the whole system of EU trade policy and consumers: we should therefore conduct a wholesale rethink of the WTO\u2019s laissez-faire doctrines.\nWe believe that it is important for the European Union to retain an economic model that places at its centre respect for social clauses and the rights of workers in all parts of the world.\nEurope ought to be more active in the various international bodies to promote work with dignity. Europe ought to bring in regulations designed to promote labels for ascertaining geographical provenance and compliance with social and environmental rules.\nIf we do not call into question the WTO\u2019s laissez-faire policies, then after textiles and shoes will come a long list of other products.", "lang": "IT", "original": "Vittorio Agnoletto, a nome del gruppo GUE/NGL . \u2013 Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, per dieci anni, l\u2019Unione europea e gli Stati Uniti hanno guidato le trattative per l\u2019entrata della Cina nell\u2019OMC.
