Sports shoes have been excluded, but how do we define sports shoes? Children\u2019s shoes have been excluded; I and many, many other women still wear these shoes despite not having been children for some time.\nThe application of anti-dumping measures has taken place with a sluggishness that has not been seen before, and above all anti-dumping duties are being proposed that are not sufficient to tackle a situation of unfair competition that the Commission itself defines as serious.\nSo I ask you: do you not believe that lurking behind the defence of consumers, in particular poorer families, as you wrote in Sunday\u2019s Le Figaro , there is also, or perhaps chiefly \u2013 I do not know \u2013 an attempt to protect the interests of multinationals?\nDo you not believe that the Commission\u2019s policy, which I consider to be at times ambiguous, might endanger the important, if not unique, instrument of European commercial policy?\nFinally, I would like you to comment on what is happening in the bed linen sector since, in this case too, the action taken by the Commission is not easy to understand.", "lang": "IT", "original": "Pia Elda Locatelli (PSE). \u2013 Signor Presidente, signor Commissario, onorevoli colleghi, vorrei solo dire che ha l\u2019impressione di occuparmi di un guscio ormai vuoto.
