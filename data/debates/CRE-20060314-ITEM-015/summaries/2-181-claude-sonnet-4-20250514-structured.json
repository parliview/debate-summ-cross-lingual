{"speaker": "Tokia Sa\u00effi (PPE-DE). \u2013", "english": "Tokia Sa\u00effi (PPE-DE). \u2013 (FR) Mr\u00a0President, Commissioner, you have supplied us with the figures: today, footwear production in Europe has decreased by around 30%, import prices have fallen by more than 20% and, above all, the sector has lost nearly 40\u00a0000 jobs. Six months have passed since the textile industry affair and, just as we had predicted at the time, the Community market once again finds itself faced with unfair commercial practices. In fact, we have \u2013 as you pointed out \u2013 evidence of state intervention and of the granting of backdoor subsidies to manufacturers from China and Vietnam. Faced with the evidence of such a violation of commercial practices, the European Union has a duty to react and to repair the damage caused to the Community industry, and this in accordance with WTO rules.\nThat is why it is necessary \u2013 as you have demonstrated, Commissioner \u2013 to implement antidumping measures in relation to these imports. To establish a law for products that are subject to dumping does not amount to asking the consumer to subsidise uncompetitive European businesses. Rather, it is a question, in fact, of guaranteeing the conditions for balanced trade, which protects the interests of both consumers and manufacturers. Thus, to intervene with the aim of limiting the harmful effects of dumping should not be regarded as protectionism.\nThe European Union aspires to harmonious and open relations with its Asian partners in order also to free these populations from poverty. However, it also aspires to enforce fair and equitable trade rules for all.", "lang": "FR", "original": "Tokia Sa\u00effi (PPE-DE). - Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, Monsieur le Commissaire, vous nous avez donn\u00e9 les chiffres: aujourd\u2019hui, la production de chaussures en Europe a recul\u00e9 d\u2019environ 30\u00a0%, les prix \u00e0 l\u2019importation ont chut\u00e9 de plus de 20\u00a0% et, surtout, le secteur a perdu pr\u00e8s de 40\u00a0000\u00a0emplois.

Instituer un droit sur des marchandises faisant l\u2019objet d\u2019un dumping ne revient pas \u00e0 demander au consommateur de subventionner des entreprises europ\u00e9ennes non concurrentielles.
