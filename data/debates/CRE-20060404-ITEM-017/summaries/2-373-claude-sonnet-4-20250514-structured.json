We are talking about gases that have enormous global warming potential.

We have a regulation that fails to recognise the fact that alternatives already exist for most F-gas applications, that fails to promote substitution and that will set back the introduction of safe and innovative alternatives for years, not just in the European Union but in the developing world as well, where F-gas emissions are predicted to grow enormously over the next few decades. We have a regulation that represents a shameful capitulation to the F-gas industry.\nSo I repeat again the question that others have raised: Would the Commission clarify once and for all whether it will drop the proceedings against Austria and Denmark? At the very beginning of February my colleagues and I wrote to Commissioner\u00a0Dimas to ask this question. We have still not received a response. This is unacceptable and the proceedings should be dropped immediately.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Caroline Lucas, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . \u2013 Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Doyle for her excellent collaboration and for being so willing to try to find compromises on which we could all agree.
