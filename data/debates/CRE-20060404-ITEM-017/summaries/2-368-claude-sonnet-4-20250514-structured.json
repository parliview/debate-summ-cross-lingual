{"speaker": "J\u00e1n Fige\u013e,", "english": "J\u00e1n Fige\u013e, Member of the Commission . Mr President, I should like to pass on greetings from my colleague, Mr\u00a0Dimas. Please allow me to introduce the position of the European Commission on this matter.\nFirst of all, I would like to express my appreciation to the delegation of Parliament that took part in the conciliation meeting with the Council on 31\u00a0January. In particular I would like to express my thanks to Vice-President Trakatellis and to the rapporteur, Mrs Doyle, and to congratulate them on the outcome.\nThe discussions in the Conciliation Committee were constructive and the final outcome on key issues \u2013 such as standards for containment, labelling, placing on the market, promotion of alternatives, as well as on a number of other important topics \u2013 is satisfactory. The Commission can therefore support the conciliation text and I would encourage Parliament to endorse the very good result obtained by its negotiating team. I believe that the regulation on F-gases, as well as the directive on mobile air conditioners in cars, will make a significant contribution to the EU\u2019s fight against climate change and to our efforts to achieve our Kyoto emission reduction target.\nThe Commission estimates that the legislation that we are discussing today will, by 2012, cut emissions of fluorinated gases by some 20 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent annually. That implies a reduction of 20% compared to 1995. In the absence of measures, emissions of fluorinated gases would have risen by 50% in the same period. From 2020, when all measures will be fully implemented, the effect will be a reduction of 40-50 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent.\nEU climate policy builds on close cooperation between the Commission and Member States. Only through common and combined action, at European and at national level, will the European Union be effective in reducing its emissions of greenhouse gases. The Commission therefore welcomes measures taken by Member States to reduce national emissions in order to meet their burden-sharing target. In that context, however, the Commission\u2019s responsibility is to preserve any right it might have to ensure that all actions carried out to reduce emissions of F-gases are compatible with the Treaty. That is why the Commission should like issue the following declaration on the question of stricter national measures:\n\u2018The Commission notes the agreement between the European Parliament and the Council on the insertion in the regulation of a provision allowing Member States to maintain, until 2012, more stringent national measures compared to those laid down in the regulation, should these measures be adopted before 31\u00a0December 2005. It results from the Treaty that if, after the adoption of a harmonised measure, a Member State considers it necessary to maintain national measures that are justified by important requirements specified in Article 30 of the EC Treaty, or relating to the protection of the environment or of the working environment, this Member State notifies them to the Commission, indicating the reasons for their maintenance. Additionally, the Treaty specifies the rules for the acceptance or rejection of these measures by the Commission. The Commission is therefore obliged to reserve its position on this issue, including any right it may have under the Treaty.\u2019\nOnce again, I thank Parliament for its open and constructive approach on the F-gases package. The outcome is strong and effective legislation, which, once again, demonstrates the European Union\u2019s capacity to match its words with concrete deeds in its climate policy.", "lang": "EN", "original": "J\u00e1n Fige\u013e, Member of the Commission .
