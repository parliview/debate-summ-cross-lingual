{"speaker": "Margrete Auken (Verts/ALE). \u2013", "english": "Margrete Auken (Verts/ALE). \u2013 (DA) Mr\u00a0President, I had actually intended to make a different speech but, having heard the debate in this House, I must thank Mrs\u00a0Doyle for her splendid contribution. I cannot, however, in any way see how her efforts might bear fruit, as the Commission is expressly saying that only those countries that have more stringent rules now may be given permission to stick to those rules. There is nothing about countries being able to go further and no assurance of Denmark being able to go further. When I think of the zeal with which Mrs\u00a0Doyle\u2019s proposal at second reading was fought against, I do not understand from where Mr\u00a0Bonde, Mr\u00a0Busk and the others derive their optimism. There are no reassuring signals. We are faced here with a proposal that is an affront to all constructive forces working in favour of the environment. There is, in fact, such a thing as substitution. Alternatives do exist. We have efficient refrigerators in Denmark and Austria, yet the choice has been made to defer to the fluorinated gases industry instead of to the environment. I cannot see anything in the Commission\u2019s pronouncement that goes any way at all towards pledging anything more constructive. It is therefore exclusively Mrs\u00a0Doyle whom I shall thank for her splendid but, it has to be said, entirely fruitless efforts.", "lang": "DA", "original": "Margrete Auken (Verts/ALE). - Hr. formand Jeg havde egentlig t\u00e6nkt mig at holde en anden tale, men efter at have h\u00f8rt debatten her m\u00e5 jeg sige tak til fru Doyle for en flot indsats Jeg kan dog overhovedet ikke se, at hendes bestr\u00e6belser skulle have b\u00e5ret frugt. For n\u00e5r man h\u00f8rer Kommissionen, s\u00e5 bliver der udtrykkeligt sagt, at kun de lande, der har strengere regler nu, kan f\u00e5 lov til at holde fast ved de regler. Der er intet om, at man kan g\u00e5 videre. Der er ingen sikkerhed for, at Danmark kan g\u00e5 videre. N\u00e5r jeg t\u00e6nker p\u00e5 den iver, hvormed man bek\u00e6mpede fru Doyles forslag i forbindelse med andenbehandlingen, forst\u00e5r jeg ikke, hvor hr. Bonde, hr.

Der er alternativer. Vi har effektive k\u00f8leskabe i Danmark og i \u00d8strig, og ikke desto mindre har man valgt at tilgodese F-gas-industrien i stedet for at tilgodese milj\u00f8et.
