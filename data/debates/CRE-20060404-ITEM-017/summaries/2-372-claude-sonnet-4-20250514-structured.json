{"speaker": "Niels Busk,", "english": "Niels Busk, on behalf of the ALDE Group. \u2013 (DA) Mr\u00a0President, I shall begin by thanking Parliament\u2019s rapporteur, Mrs\u00a0Doyle, who has done a sterling piece of work on this matter. It has been a genuine pleasure to be a member of the conciliation delegation. On behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe I should like to offer my sincere thanks for the constructive cooperation. The outcome achieved by the conciliation committee is a victory for the European environment and for the people of Europe. Consideration has been given to countries such as Denmark and Austria, which have taken the ban on fluorinated gases further, and other countries can follow their lead. This proves that the EU puts the environment before everything else.\nWhen, tomorrow, the European Parliament adopts the conciliation committee\u2019s document by what I hope will be a very large majority, I assume that Environment Commissioner Mr\u00a0Dimas will take the opportunity to withdraw the Commission\u2019s letter of formal notice addressed to Denmark. That should be a natural consequence of this new statutory text. Now that the Community legislation has been changed, there will be no basis for taking legal proceedings against Denmark at the European Court of Justice.\nIt was depressing to hear in the corridors that the Commission\u2019s legal service has refused to accept the outcome of the conciliation or has tried to misinterpret it. Allow me to remind the Commission that it would be quite unprecedented and completely unacceptable if the new Community legislation were not administered by the Commission. It would also be detrimental to cooperation with, and confidence in, the Commission. The Council and the European Parliament have approved the agreement and the content of the conciliation document. The Commission was a party to the agreement of 31\u00a0January 2006 and is therefore partly responsible for it. I would therefore ask you, Commissioner, to withdraw the letter of formal notice addressed to Denmark following tomorrow\u2019s vote when a large majority of Parliament has voted in favour of the document. Anything else would be unacceptable in terms of future cooperation.", "lang": "DA", "original": "Niels Busk, for ALDE-Gruppen . - Hr. formand Jeg vil starte med at takke Parlamentets ordf\u00f8rer, fru Doyle, som har udf\u00f8rt et eminent stykke arbejde i denne sag. Det har v\u00e6ret en sand forn\u00f8jelse at v\u00e6re medlem af Forligsdelegationen. P\u00e5 ALDE-Gruppens vegne vil jeg gerne sige en varm tak for det gode samarbejde. Forligsudvalgets resultat er en sejr for Europas milj\u00f8 og for Europas borgere. Lande som Danmark og \u00d8strig, som er g\u00e5et l\u00e6ngere med forbud mod F-gasser, er blevet tilgodeset, og andre lande kan f\u00f8lge efter. Det beviser, at EU s\u00e6tter milj\u00f8et i allerf\u00f8rste r\u00e6kke.\nN\u00e5r Europa-Parlamentet i morgen vedtager Forligsudvalgets tekst med et forh\u00e5bentligt meget stort flertal, g\u00e5r jeg ud fra, at milj\u00f8kommiss\u00e6r Dimas benytter lejligheden til at tr\u00e6kke Kommissionens \u00e5bningsskrivelse mod Danmark tilbage. Det b\u00f8r v\u00e6re en naturlig konsekvens af denne nye lovtekst. Nu hvor f\u00e6llesskabslovgivningen er \u00e6ndret, vil der ikke v\u00e6re noget bel\u00e6g for at f\u00f8re en sag mod Danmark ved EF-Domstolen.\nDet har v\u00e6ret forstemmende at h\u00f8re i korridorerne, at Kommissionens juridiske tjeneste har v\u00e6gret sig ved at acceptere forligsresultatet eller har fors\u00f8gt at fejlfortolke det. Lad mig minde Kommissionen om, at det er helt uh\u00f8rt og ganske uacceptabelt og i \u00f8vrigt \u00f8del\u00e6ggende for samarbejdet og tilliden til Kommissionen, hvis den nye f\u00e6llesskabslovgivning ikke administreres af Kommissionen. Aftalen og indholdet af forligsteksten har R\u00e5det og Europa-Parlamentet aftalt. Kommissionen har deltaget og er derfor medansvarlig for aftalen af 31. januar 2006. Derfor, hr. kommiss\u00e6r, tr\u00e6k \u00e5bningsskrivelsen mod Danmark tilbage efter afstemningen i morgen, n\u00e5r et stort flertal i Parlamentet har sagt ja til teksten.
