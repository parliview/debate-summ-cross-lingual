{"speaker": "Jens-Peter Bonde,", "english": "Jens-Peter Bonde, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. \u2013 (DA) Mr\u00a0President, I have some really good news: the President of the Commission, Mr\u00a0Barroso, and the Vice-President, Mr\u00a0Verheugen, have today promised to withdraw the three extant letters of formal notice concerning fluorinated gases. The Commission will thus be a party to the compromise reached between the Council and Parliament in the conciliation procedure. The undertaking is particularly gratifying because the Commission had adopted a declaration, reserving to itself the right to declare the Austrian and Danish bans on fluorinated gases unlawful. The declaration was a provocation, which we can now put to one side.\nI should like to thank Mr\u00a0Barroso and Mr\u00a0Verheugen for their personal support in this matter, and I should also like to thank the President of the European Council, Mr\u00a0Sch\u00fcssel, who has offered his personal support in relation to a matter that was initially dropped by the Council of Ministers when Austria took over the Presidency. There are also, in fact, reasons for thanking ourselves here in this Chamber, because we voted in favour of the much discussed Amendment\u00a045, which made the victory possible. By means of amendments we shall turn the decision concerning fluorinated gases into a minimal rule in which countries are given permission to go further in protecting our common climate. Three hundred and sixty-seven votes are needed if we elected representatives are to have real influence, and we obtained 370. We therefore owe the Chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, Mr\u00a0Florenz, and the rapporteur, Mrs\u00a0Doyle a considerable debt of gratitude because they stood firm in their support for minimal rules, even though they were exposed to heavy pressure, including from their own group.\nI also wish especially to congratulate those responsible for now creating a clear precedent for our being able to introduce minimal rules, even when the legal base is the internal market\u2019s provisions. We are obtaining a greater number of possible ways of taking account of security, health, the environment, the working environment, consumer protection and animal welfare, and we are moving a step away from regimentation and from what is referred to as total harmonisation. I hope that this will not be an isolated development but, on the contrary, will herald a new direction for European cooperation. People will thank us if, by means of majority decisions, we secure a common level of protection and, at the same time, give countries permission to be pioneers. In this way, everyone will sense that progress has been made. Danes and Austrians will be quite uncomprehending if the Commission makes its efforts to combat climate change a political priority and, at the same time, punishes Denmark and Austria for making a special effort.\nMr\u00a0Verheugen, Mr\u00a0Dimas and Mr\u00a0Barroso would be uncomprehending, too. The Eurocrats in the departments of the Commission have now hopefully been put in their place. We representatives of the people have made a difference, and we can be proud of our joint efforts. The next task must, of course, be that of convincing all the countries that there are technical alternatives, so that we might obtain a common EU ban on fluorinated gases, preferably before 2012 when the Kyoto Agreement is to be renewed in a spirit of consideration for future generations. I hope that Mr\u00a0Barroso and Mr\u00a0Verheugen will firmly resist those who are trying to drag them down into the mud.", "lang": "DA", "original": "Jens-Peter Bonde, for IND/DEM-Gruppen . - Hr. formand Jeg har en virkelig god nyhed: Formanden for Kommissionen, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, og n\u00e6stformand, G\u00fcnter Verheugen, har i dag lovet, at de vil tr\u00e6kke de tre igangv\u00e6rende \u00e5bningsskrivelser vedr\u00f8rende F-gasser tilbage. Dermed kommer Kommissionen med i det kompromis, som blev indg\u00e5et mellem R\u00e5det og Parlamentet i forligsproceduren. Tilsagnet er s\u00e6rligt gl\u00e6deligt, fordi Kommissionen havde vedtaget en erkl\u00e6ring, hvori de forbeholdt sig ret til at erkl\u00e6re det \u00f8strigske og danske forbud mod F-gasser ulovligt. Erkl\u00e6ringen var en provokation, som vi nu kan l\u00e6gge til side.\nJeg vil gerne takke hr. Barroso og hr. Verheugen for deres personlige st\u00f8tte i denne sag. Og jeg vil gerne takke formanden for Det Europ\u00e6iske R\u00e5d, Wolfgang Sch\u00fcssel, som har givet sin personlige st\u00f8tte i en sag, som i f\u00f8rste omgang var tabt p\u00e5 gulvet i Ministerr\u00e5det, da \u00d8strig overtog formandskabet. Og s\u00e5 er der faktisk grund til at takke os selv her i salen, fordi vi stemte for den meget omtalte \u00e6ndring nr. 45, som muliggjorde sejren. Med \u00e6ndringsforslag vil vi g\u00f8re F-gasbeslutningen til en minimumsregel, hvor landene f\u00e5r lov til at g\u00e5 l\u00e6ngere i beskyttelsen af vores f\u00e6lles klima. Der skal 367 stemmer til reel indflydelse for os folkevalgte - vi fik 370 stemmer! Og vi skylder derfor formanden for milj\u00f8udvalget, Karl-Heinz Florenz, og ordf\u00f8reren, Avril Doyle, en stor tak, fordi de stod fast p\u00e5 deres st\u00f8tte til minimumsregler, selv om de blev udsat for st\u00e6rkt pres - herunder i deres egen gruppe.\nOg jeg vil s\u00e6rligt sige tillykke, fordi der nu er skabt en klar pr\u00e6cedens for, at vi kan indf\u00f8re minimumsregler, ogs\u00e5 n\u00e5r hjemlen er det indre markeds bestemmelser. Vi f\u00e5r flere muligheder for at tage hensyn til sikkerhed, sundhed, milj\u00f8, arbejdsmilj\u00f8, forbrugerbeskyttelse og dyrevelf\u00e6rd. Vi g\u00e5r et skridt v\u00e6k fra ensretning og s\u00e5kaldt totalharmonisering. Jeg h\u00e5ber ikke, det bliver en enlig svale men derimod en ny retning for det europ\u00e6iske samarbejde. Borgerne vil takke os, hvis vi med flertalsbeslutninger sikrer et f\u00e6lles beskyttelsesniveau og samtidig giver lande lov til at v\u00e6re foregangslande. P\u00e5 den m\u00e5de oplever alle borgere fremskridt. Ingen danskere eller \u00f8strigere vil kunne forst\u00e5, hvis Kommissionen g\u00f8r sin indsats mod klima\u00e6ndringer til en politisk prioritet og samtidig vil straffe Danmark og \u00d8strig for at g\u00f8re en s\u00e6rlig indsats.\nDet kunne hr. Verheugen, hr. Dimas og hr. Barroso heller ikke. Eurokraterne i Kommissionens tjenestegrene bliver nu forh\u00e5bentlig sat p\u00e5 plads. Vi folkevalgte har gjort en forskel. Vi kan v\u00e6re stolte over vores f\u00e6lles indsats. Og n\u00e6ste opgave m\u00e5 jo s\u00e5 v\u00e6re at overbevise alle lande om, at der findes tekniske alternativer, s\u00e5 vi kan f\u00e5 et f\u00e6lles EU-forbud mod F-gasserne og helst inden 2012, hvor Kyoto-aftalen skal fornys med et h\u00e5ndslag til kommende generationer. Jeg h\u00e5ber, at hr. Barroso og hr. Verheugen st\u00e5r fast mod dem, der pr\u00f8ver at tr\u00e6kke dem ned i skidtet.", "agenda_item": "Fluorinated greenhouse gases \u2013 Emissions from air-conditioning systems in motor vehicles (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060404-ITEM-017", "intervention_id": "2-375", "summary_english": "{\n\"headline\": \"Commission withdraws legal action against Austria and Denmark over fluorinated gas bans, establishing precedent for minimal harmonization rules\",\n\"issueSum\": \"The key issues raised relate to the Commission's previous legal challenges against Austrian and Danish national bans on fluorinated greenhouse gases, the need for climate protection measures, and the broader question of whether EU member states can implement stricter environmental standards than EU minimums under internal market provisions.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"The speaker strongly supports allowing member states to implement stricter environmental protections than EU minimums, viewing this as beneficial for climate protection and democratic governance.
