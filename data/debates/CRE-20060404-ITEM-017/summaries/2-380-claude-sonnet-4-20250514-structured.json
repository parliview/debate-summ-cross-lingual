The Council and the Commission have defended old, outmoded technology in the internal market instead of defending the climate. History will not be kind in judging such action.\nFor example, why are we not banning fluorinated greenhouse gases in the refrigerators sold to consumers? Ninety per cent of the market is already free from fluorinated greenhouse gases. It is an extremely straightforward matter simply to decide to ban them. Why do we allow sulphur hexachloride, which does 23\u00a0000 times more damage to the climate than carbon dioxide? The only way of obtaining an alternative is, of course, to set a time limit, whereupon research would come up with the right alternatives. Moreover, there are now already a number of alternatives.\nThere must be a typing error in the Commission\u2019s speech, because I would have thought you would very happily have looked forward to countries\u2019 introducing more stringent legislation in order to achieve the Kyoto objectives. I can only assume that there is a typing error in the speech, for the Commission surely cannot be responsible for such an outmoded and old-fashioned policy.", "lang": "SV", "original": "Carl Schlyter (Verts/ALE). \u2013 Herr talman!
