{"speaker": "Jonas Sj\u00f6stedt,", "english": "Jonas Sj\u00f6stedt, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. \u2013 (SV) Mr\u00a0President, our group did not vote in favour of this compromise in the conciliation committee, and we shall not vote in favour of it in plenary tomorrow. We are not satisfied with the content, and we are definitely not satisfied with the legal basis. That is not a criticism of the rapporteur. We believe that Mrs\u00a0Doyle has done the best she possibly could in a difficult situation and has tried to go as far as humanly possible in claiming the right to retain and to introduce better environmental requirements. Given, however, the very weak position in which she found herself following Parliament\u2019s second reading, she was unable to achieve the only reasonable objective, namely that of having environmental Article 175 adopted as the only legal basis. For us, the only acceptable outcome is for environmental legislation to be allowed to be precisely that.\nWe see two problems with this compromise. The first problem is that, in our view, larger steps could have been taken where various parts of it were concerned. More rapid progress can be made in abolishing these very dangerous greenhouse gases. The most serious consideration of all, however, is that there is now an active risk of putting obstacles in the way of countries that want to tighten up their national legislation in this area. This situation violates the spirit of the Kyoto Protocol and could be an obstacle to countries that wish to combat climate change which, as we all know, is the most serious environmental threat we face.\nWhere Denmark and Austria are concerned, they are to be given a guarantee up until the year 2012, whereupon the guarantee will come to an end. We shall then not know what is to happen, and there will again be a danger of these countries actively being forced to curb the legislation they already have. Where other countries are concerned, there would in actual fact be an end to reform if the Commission does not take a different decision. This situation is completely unacceptable.\nIt also means that countries within the EU will have difficulty producing new technology \u2013 which is precisely what this document says they should be doing \u2013 with a view to taking the lead by banning dangerous gases and forcing alternatives to be produced using just such new technology. By their action, the Council and the Commission are preventing new technology from being produced. In our debates, we usually agree on the seriousness of climate issues, and we usually agree with the researchers\u2019 reports we see, saying that the situation is more serious than we believed a few years ago. Then comes this statement from the Commission, showing that it has learned nothing about climate issues. What you are saying is that the market remains more important than the environment. Companies\u2019 right to sell dangerous gases is more important than political opportunities to combat the greenhouse effect and climate change. It is remarkable that such a thing can be said in 2006.\n(Applause from various quarters)", "lang": "SV", "original": "Jonas Sj\u00f6stedt, f\u00f6r GUE/NGL-gruppen . \u2013 Herr talman! V\u00e5r grupp r\u00f6stade inte f\u00f6r denna kompromiss i f\u00f6rlikningskommitt\u00e9n, och vi kommer inte att r\u00f6sta f\u00f6r den i plenum i morgon. Vi \u00e4r inte n\u00f6jda med inneh\u00e5llet och vi \u00e4r absolut inte n\u00f6jda med den r\u00e4ttsliga grunden. Detta \u00e4r inte n\u00e5gon kritik mot f\u00f6redraganden.

F\u00f6r oss \u00e4r det enda acceptabla: att milj\u00f6lagstiftning f\u00e5r vara milj\u00f6lagstiftning.\nVi ser tv\u00e5 problem med denna kompromiss. Det f\u00f6rsta problemet \u00e4r att vi anser att man i olika delar av den kunde ha g\u00e5tt l\u00e4ngre; det kan g\u00e5 snabbare att avskaffa dessa mycket farliga v\u00e4xthusgaser. Men det allvarligaste av allt \u00e4r att man nu aktivt riskerar att hindra l\u00e4nder som vill sk\u00e4rpa sin nationella lagstiftning p\u00e5 detta omr\u00e5de. Det bryter mot andan i Kyotoprotokollet och kommer att kunna vara ett hinder f\u00f6r l\u00e4nder som vill bek\u00e4mpa klimatf\u00f6r\u00e4ndringarna, och som vi alla vet \u00e4r klimatf\u00f6r\u00e4ndringarna det allvarligaste milj\u00f6hot som vi st\u00e5r inf\u00f6r.\nN\u00e4r det g\u00e4ller Danmark och \u00d6sterrike f\u00e5r de en garanti fram till \u00e5r 2012, sedan \u00e4r garantin slut, sedan vet vi inte vad som kommer att h\u00e4nda, d\u00e5 \u00e5terkommer risken att de aktivt tvingas att s\u00e4nka den lagstiftning de redan har. N\u00e4r det g\u00e4ller andra l\u00e4nder s\u00e5 \u00e4r det faktiskt reformstopp om inte kommissionen beslutar annorlunda. Det \u00e4r helt oacceptabelt att det \u00e4r p\u00e5 det s\u00e4ttet.\nDetta inneb\u00e4r ocks\u00e5 att l\u00e4nder inom EU kommer att ha sv\u00e5rt att ta fram ny teknik \u2013 precis det som man s\u00e4ger i detta dokument att man skall g\u00f6ra \u2013 f\u00f6r att g\u00e5 f\u00f6re och f\u00f6rbjuda farliga gaser och tvinga fram alternativ som ny teknik kan ta fram. R\u00e5det och kommissionen hindrar h\u00e4r att man tar fram med ny teknik. Vi brukar i v\u00e5ra debatter vara \u00f6verens om allvaret i klimatfr\u00e5gorna och vi brukar vara \u00f6verens n\u00e4r vi ser forskarrapporterna som s\u00e4ger att situationen \u00e4r allvarligare \u00e4n vi trodde f\u00f6r n\u00e5gra \u00e5r sedan.
