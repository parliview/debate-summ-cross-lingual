{"speaker": "Caroline Lucas,", "english": "Caroline Lucas, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . \u2013 Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Doyle for her excellent collaboration and for being so willing to try to find compromises on which we could all agree. But having said that, while my Group can live with the directive on mobile air-conditioning \u2013 although in our view it is still too weak \u2013 we cannot accept the results of the conciliation on the regulation on F-gases, in spite of Mrs Doyle's good offices to try to get a better deal, but which ultimately failed.\nThe European institutions like to pride themselves on their international leadership in terms of policy on climate change, the greatest threat we face, and yet this regulation is a tragedy of missed opportunity and sets back the potential of our climate policy by decades. We are talking about gases that have enormous global warming potential. They include sulphur hexafluoride, which is over 23\u00a0000 times more powerful as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide and yet will still be permitted in some applications.\nYet what we have in front of us is a regulation with a legal base that casts doubt on the ongoing right of Austria and Denmark to keep their stricter national laws beyond six years and that will actively work against the ability of other Member States to adopt them. We have a regulation that fails to recognise the fact that alternatives already exist for most F-gas applications, that fails to promote substitution and that will set back the introduction of safe and innovative alternatives for years, not just in the European Union but in the developing world as well, where F-gas emissions are predicted to grow enormously over the next few decades. We have a regulation that represents a shameful capitulation to the F-gas industry.\nSo I repeat again the question that others have raised: Would the Commission clarify once and for all whether it will drop the proceedings against Austria and Denmark? At the very beginning of February my colleagues and I wrote to Commissioner\u00a0Dimas to ask this question. We have still not received a response. This is unacceptable and the proceedings should be dropped immediately.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Caroline Lucas, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . \u2013 Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Doyle for her excellent collaboration and for being so willing to try to find compromises on which we could all agree.
