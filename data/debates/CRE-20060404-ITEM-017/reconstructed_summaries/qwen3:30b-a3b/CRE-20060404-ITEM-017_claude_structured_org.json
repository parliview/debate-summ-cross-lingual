Firstly, I wish to thank all my colleagues, in particular the shadow rapporteur, Mrs Corbey, for the cooperation we had during a long and difficult enough debate at times.\nFluorinated gases were introduced in the nineties to replace the ozone-depleting CFCs and HCFCs. They are used in all sorts of applications, some essential, others less so: in insulating foams, in aerosols, in refrigeration and air conditioning systems; in fire protection equipment and switchgear and even in the soles of \u2018air-tech\u2019 jogging shoes, as well as, of course, in double-glazed windows. The list is very long.\nAs the debate on climate change developed following the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the harmful impact of these fluorinated gases, owing to their high global warming potential \u2013 GWP \u2013 came to be recognised as a major contributor \u2013 up to 5% and rising \u2013 to the greenhouse effect. Not only do these gases have high GWPs, the most potent \u2013 sulphur hexafluoride or SF6 \u2013 has a GWP of almost 24\u00a0000 times that of CO2, the most common greenhouse gas. They also have very long half-lives.\nIf no measures are taken, the Commission estimates that emissions of fluorinated gases will be 50% above the 1995 levels by 2010. Others would cite a much higher figure. With the measures agreed in this package of legislation, they will be reduced by more than 20% from the 1995 levels by 2012. Of the six greenhouse gases listed in the annex to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, three of them are fluorinated gases. In all, the current legislation encourages a reduction in emissions of 25 fluorinated gases \u2013 hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride \u2013 through containment, responsible use, recovery, destruction and disposal. The aim of the legislation is to enable Member States to meet their Kyoto targets by containing the leakage and restricting the use of fluorinated gases.\nWhereas the original Commission draft proposal was in the form of one regulation with a single market legal base, namely Article\u00a095, the Council reached a common position which took the form of two separate texts: a directive based on Article\u00a095 and a regulation based on a dual legal base consisting of Articles\u00a0175 and 95. The rationale for the split of the Commission\u2019s original proposal into two different texts, suggested by the European Parliament at its first reading, was to move all the requirements relating to emissions from air conditioning in motor vehicles from the proposed regulation to Framework Directive 70/156/EEC on the type-approval of motor vehicles. The proposed regulation would then focus on the remaining statutory applications. So, having chopped it in two and taken the highly dubious step of dividing the regulation between two legal bases \u2013 the main thrust being environment, with some ancillary provisions grounded on the single market legal base \u2013 the Council handed the baton back to Parliament. In the second reading in Parliament, there was no definitive resolution on the crucial vexed issue of the dual legal base of the regulation, which was retained.\nMy proposal, as rapporteur, to adopt a single environment-linked legal base as the only means of achieving legal certainty, did not obtain the required qualified majority. Amendments were adopted, however, which attempted to underline the fact that stricter national measures are allowed under single market measures, provided they are proportionate, non-discriminatory and not purely economic in nature. Article 176 of the Treaty explains this mechanism relating to the environment or the Article\u00a0175 laws.\nThis outcome created great uncertainty for a number of reasons. Firstly, there was the matter of general principle that, in the interests of promoting better, simpler and clearer legislation, the introduction of an unevenly weighted, dual legal basis represents a dangerous direction and precedent in European policy-making. Secondly, there is the ECJ\u2019s consistent case-law according to which there should be a sole legal base which reflects the preponderant purpose or the centre of gravity of the legislation. The centre of gravity of this regulation is indisputably environmental protection, which would warrant an environment base \u2013 an approach of minimum harmonisation. Finally, there was the unresolved question as to whether the Member States that already have more ambitious legislation in force \u2013 notably Austria and Denmark \u2013 would be allowed to keep those measures, or whether the EU would force them to lower their environmental standards in an area of combating climate change at a time when there are already difficulties in meeting Kyoto targets to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Given the implacable divisions within the Council on this final issue of stricter national measures for certain Member States, a third reading in conciliation was inevitable.\nAfter many exhaustive weeks of informatory preparatory work and meetings, the Conciliation Committee reached agreement on a joint text for the regulation concerning certain fluorinated greenhouse gases \u2013 f-gases \u2013 on 31\u00a0January 2006, which addressed the main points of disagreement between Parliament and the Council, which are namely: the possibility for the Member States to keep or introduce national measures stricter than those foreseen by the regulation; technical provisions regarding f-gas containment; reporting and review of the regulation; definition of placing on the market; cross-border transport or shipment of f-gases for recovery; labelling; notification of measures introducing further bans on f-gases; and the area of training and certification.\nHowever, the key point that I want to refer to again is the issue of stricter national measures. Important for encouraging an environmental race to the top was the agreement on the general principle that Member States can maintain or introduce stricter national measures in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty. In the specific case of the existing national measures in Denmark and Austria, against which the Commission has been considering legal action, a safeguard clause was introduced which would allow the two Member States to keep their legislation until 31\u00a0December 2012. Both countries already have strict legislation on f-gases in place \u2013 since the 1970s in the case of Denmark \u2013 and they view it as a key measure in their policy mix to achieve their Kyoto climate change targets.\nI believe the legislation now agreed and awaiting final sanction by our colleagues in this Parliament tomorrow strikes an equitable balance between environmental protection and single market concerns. It reaffirms the European Community\u2019s commitment to reducing climate change and will provide a considerable stimulus to the development of new environmental technologies, thus contributing to our Lisbon Agenda knowledge economy goals. It will do so in a measured, sensible and proportionate way that recognises certain critical uses for these gases, which, we must not forget, can be useful in certain circumstances for the very reason that they are excellent insulators. Electrical or electronic switch gear, amongst other vital uses, will continue to use f-gases in a contained environment. There is no better or more suitable substitute in that case, and that must be the test.\nThe conciliation compromise was welcomed by the three institutions, by myself, by my European Parliament colleagues, by Minister Pr\u00f6ll, on behalf of the European Council, and by the Environment Commissioner, Mr Dimas. It was the only equitable and honourable outcome. To quote directly, Commissioner Dimas welcomed the agreement as \u2018a clear and positive political signal\u2019 but alluded to the fact that the Commission would later decide whether to issue a declaration on the record when the legislation was finally adopted, as it is scheduled to be tomorrow.\nI should like to lay down a marker in relation to the declaration we have just heard from Commissioner Fige\u013e, speaking on behalf of Commissioner Dimas. In the laborious process of negotiating this legislation, it was the clear intention of the legislators \u2013 Parliament and the Council \u2013 to provide for the widest possible interpretation of the powers for environmental measures to be taken on the basis of a single market legal base. I strenuously reject any attempt by the Commission to construe the terms of that legal base so as to narrowly confine it to Article\u00a095(4), which outlines a prior notification procedure. Such a declaration represents a misinterpretation of the outcome of conciliation, where there was a clear if implicit intention to allow stricter national measures on the basis of Article 95(10). While any declaration from the Commission in this context is non-binding, it may play a role in the purpose of interpretation of the ECJ on this subject, if perchance this legislation, which has already spanned two legislatures, gets a fourth reading at the Court in Luxembourg, as was my concern from the start.\nTonight I want to make it clear that the principal aims of this regulation \u2013 to cut our emissions of fluorinated gases \u2013 should be respected and adhered to in the fullest sense. I regret the fact that the Commission has not to date made the gesture of withdrawing its letter of formal notice to the Danish Government.

I welcome the pioneering decision to introduce a phased ban on fluorinated gases with a global warming potential of more than 150 times the potency of carbon dioxide in motor vehicles. This ban will apply to new vehicle types in 2011 and to all new vehicles in 2017. Bringing the measure into line with the long-established vehicle type approval system will also maintain the competitiveness and ensure the compliance of European car manufacturers. The risk threshold will eliminate the main air conditioning gas currently in use and it will allow less harmful gases to be used instead. In practice, most vehicle producers are likely to introduce carbon-dioxide-based systems. But the important point is that we are allowing the development of these new systems without being technology prescriptive and without infringing our obligations under the WTO.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Avril Doyle (PPE-DE), rapporteur . \u2013 Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for accepting my invitation for him to lead off in the debate tonight, because I have concerns about the declaration he has just put on the record and I will be reverting to it during the debate, as, I suspect, will other colleagues too.\nThis legislation is a fascinating case study for anyone interested in the institutional decision-making processes of the European Parliament. Firstly, I wish to thank all my colleagues, in particular the shadow rapporteur, Mrs Corbey, for the cooperation we had during a long and difficult enough debate at times.\nFluorinated gases were introduced in the nineties to replace the ozone-depleting CFCs and HCFCs. They are used in all sorts of applications, some essential, others less so: in insulating foams, in aerosols, in refrigeration and air conditioning systems; in fire protection equipment and switchgear and even in the soles of \u2018air-tech\u2019 jogging shoes, as well as, of course, in double-glazed windows. The list is very long.\nAs the debate on climate change developed following the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the harmful impact of these fluorinated gases, owing to their high global warming potential \u2013 GWP \u2013 came to be recognised as a major contributor \u2013 up to 5% and rising \u2013 to the greenhouse effect. Not only do these gases have high GWPs, the most potent \u2013 sulphur hexafluoride or SF6 \u2013 has a GWP of almost 24\u00a0000 times that of CO2, the most common greenhouse gas. They also have very long half-lives.\nIf no measures are taken, the Commission estimates that emissions of fluorinated gases will be 50% above the 1995 levels by 2010. Others would cite a much higher figure. With the measures agreed in this package of legislation, they will be reduced by more than 20% from the 1995 levels by 2012. Of the six greenhouse gases listed in the annex to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, three of them are fluorinated gases. In all, the current legislation encourages a reduction in emissions of 25 fluorinated gases \u2013 hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride \u2013 through containment, responsible use, recovery, destruction and disposal. The aim of the legislation is to enable Member States to meet their Kyoto targets by containing the leakage and restricting the use of fluorinated gases.\nWhereas the original Commission draft proposal was in the form of one regulation with a single market legal base, namely Article\u00a095, the Council reached a common position which took the form of two separate texts: a directive based on Article\u00a095 and a regulation based on a dual legal base consisting of Articles\u00a0175 and 95. The rationale for the split of the Commission\u2019s original proposal into two different texts, suggested by the European Parliament at its first reading, was to move all the requirements relating to emissions from air conditioning in motor vehicles from the proposed regulation to Framework Directive 70/156/EEC on the type-approval of motor vehicles. The proposed regulation would then focus on the remaining statutory applications. So, having chopped it in two and taken the highly dubious step of dividing the regulation between two legal bases \u2013 the main thrust being environment, with some ancillary provisions grounded on the single market legal base \u2013 the Council handed the baton back to Parliament. In the second reading in Parliament, there was no definitive resolution on the crucial vexed issue of the dual legal base of the regulation, which was retained.\nMy proposal, as rapporteur, to adopt a single environment-linked legal base as the only means of achieving legal certainty, did not obtain the required qualified majority. Amendments were adopted, however, which attempted to underline the fact that stricter national measures are allowed under single market measures, provided they are proportionate, non-discriminatory and not purely economic in nature. Article 176 of the Treaty explains this mechanism relating to the environment or the Article\u00a0175 laws.\nThis outcome created great uncertainty for a number of reasons. Firstly, there was the matter of general principle that, in the interests of promoting better, simpler and clearer legislation, the introduction of an unevenly weighted, dual legal basis represents a dangerous direction and precedent in European policy-making. Secondly, there is the ECJ\u2019s consistent case-law according to which there should be a sole legal base which reflects the preponderant purpose or the centre of gravity of the legislation. The centre of gravity of this regulation is indisputably environmental protection, which would warrant an environment base \u2013 an approach of minimum harmonisation. Finally, there was the unresolved question as to whether the Member States that already have more ambitious legislation in force \u2013 notably Austria and Denmark \u2013 would be allowed to keep those measures, or whether the EU would force them to lower their environmental standards in an area of combating climate change at a time when there are already difficulties in meeting Kyoto targets to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Given the implacable divisions within the Council on this final issue of stricter national measures for certain Member States, a third reading in conciliation was inevitable.\nAfter many exhaustive weeks of informatory preparatory work and meetings, the Conciliation Committee reached agreement on a joint text for the regulation concerning certain fluorinated greenhouse gases \u2013 f-gases \u2013 on 31\u00a0January 2006, which addressed the main points of disagreement between Parliament and the Council, which are namely: the possibility for the Member States to keep or introduce national measures stricter than those foreseen by the regulation; technical provisions regarding f-gas containment; reporting and review of the regulation; definition of placing on the market; cross-border transport or shipment of f-gases for recovery; labelling; notification of measures introducing further bans on f-gases; and the area of training and certification.\nHowever, the key point that I want to refer to again is the issue of stricter national measures. Important for encouraging an environmental race to the top was the agreement on the general principle that Member States can maintain or introduce stricter national measures in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty. In the specific case of the existing national measures in Denmark and Austria, against which the Commission has been considering legal action, a safeguard clause was introduced which would allow the two Member States to keep their legislation until 31\u00a0December 2012. Both countries already have strict legislation on f-gases in place \u2013 since the 1970s in the case of Denmark \u2013 and they view it as a key measure in their policy mix to achieve their Kyoto climate change targets.\nI believe the legislation now agreed and awaiting final sanction by our colleagues in this Parliament tomorrow strikes an equitable balance between environmental protection and single market concerns. It reaffirms the European Community\u2019s commitment to reducing climate change and will provide a considerable stimulus to the development of new environmental technologies, thus contributing to our Lisbon Agenda knowledge economy goals. It will do so in a measured, sensible and proportionate way that recognises certain critical uses for these gases, which, we must not forget, can be useful in certain circumstances for the very reason that they are excellent insulators. Electrical or electronic switch gear, amongst other vital uses, will continue to use f-gases in a contained environment. There is no better or more suitable substitute in that case, and that must be the test.\nThe conciliation compromise was welcomed by the three institutions, by myself, by my European Parliament colleagues, by Minister Pr\u00f6ll, on behalf of the European Council, and by the Environment Commissioner, Mr Dimas. It was the only equitable and honourable outcome. To quote directly, Commissioner Dimas welcomed the agreement as \u2018a clear and positive political signal\u2019 but alluded to the fact that the Commission would later decide whether to issue a declaration on the record when the legislation was finally adopted, as it is scheduled to be tomorrow.\nI should like to lay down a marker in relation to the declaration we have just heard from Commissioner Fige\u013e, speaking on behalf of Commissioner Dimas. In the laborious process of negotiating this legislation, it was the clear intention of the legislators \u2013 Parliament and the Council \u2013 to provide for the widest possible interpretation of the powers for environmental measures to be taken on the basis of a single market legal base. I strenuously reject any attempt by the Commission to construe the terms of that legal base so as to narrowly confine it to Article\u00a095(4), which outlines a prior notification procedure. Such a declaration represents a misinterpretation of the outcome of conciliation, where there was a clear if implicit intention to allow stricter national measures on the basis of Article 95(10). While any declaration from the Commission in this context is non-binding, it may play a role in the purpose of interpretation of the ECJ on this subject, if perchance this legislation, which has already spanned two legislatures, gets a fourth reading at the Court in Luxembourg, as was my concern from the start.\nTonight I want to make it clear that the principal aims of this regulation \u2013 to cut our emissions of fluorinated gases \u2013 should be respected and adhered to in the fullest sense. I regret the fact that the Commission has not to date made the gesture of withdrawing its letter of formal notice to the Danish Government. I would urge Commissioner Fige\u013e to put on the record tonight the Commission\u2019s intention of doing so as soon as possible.\nThe directive on air conditioning systems in motor vehicles was the second arm of the package of the two proposals to emerge from the Council\u2019s first reading on the recommendation of my predecessor as rapporteur, Mr Goodwill.

Her statement showed how vigorously she has fought, both in committee and in plenary, for this issue, which is of particular importance for Austria and Denmark, because we are the two Member States with stricter regulations in this area. Above all, we have shown that it is possible to have stricter regulations without causing economic damage. I therefore have to ask the Commission why it has once again tried, in its declaration, to pull the plug on European unity.\nEnvironmental policy and popular satisfaction are united, and we in Europe are united. The Commission's attitude therefore greatly surprises me, because we successfully concluded a conciliation procedure between the Council and Parliament. The joint draft of the European Parliament and of the Council, which was approved by the Conciliation Committee on 31\u00a0January\u00a02006, provides that Member States may retain national requirements stricter than those foreseen by the Regulation until the end of 2012. The additional paragraph 3 in Article 9 gives the Member States, and in particular Austria and Denmark, the option of retaining their existing further-reaching bans on the placing on the market of fluorinated gases. If such a safeguard clause was not introduced, the Member States would have to revoke the existing bans that go beyond those in Annex II to the regulation, or have them approved by the Commission. Under Article 95(10) of the EC Treaty, harmonisation measures such as the regulation on these fluorinated greenhouse gases may include a safeguard clause temporarily authorising the Member States to take different measures. This authorisation has to be granted pursuant to the process laid down in the regulation and in the form prescribed there. Despite this, however, the Commission does not refer, in its declaration regarding Article 9(3), to the process laid down in the regulation, but repeats the wording of Article 95(4), according to which the stricter national provisions \u2013 which, moreover, are justified by recent scientific findings \u2013 must be notified to the Commission for approval.

The quote is: \"Austria and Denmark have demonstrated that stricter regulations are possible without causing economic damage\" [Seeber]. \n\nSo, the key issue here is about member states' ability to enforce stricter regulations without economic harm. His position is in favor of allowing stricter national measures. The argument he makes is that Austria and Denmark's examples show it's feasible. However, the user's instructions say to only include points attributed to the specific speaker. \n\nThe user also specified not to include other speakers' contributions. So, even though there's more context about Austria and Denmark's policies, I should focus only on what Seeber said. \n\nNow, structuring the JSON. The issueSum should mention the tension between environmental regulations and economic impact. PositionSum would state his support for member states' stricter measures. The argument is based on the example of Austria and Denmark. There's no mention of proposals or policy actions from Seeber, so propSum would be empty. \n\nWait, the example response has propSum as a summary of proposals. Since Seeber didn't propose anything specific, just cited examples, propSum should be an empty string. Let me check the original debate summary again to confirm there's no other info on Seeber. \n\nYes, only the one quote. So the JSON should reflect that. Make sure the keys are correct and the values are concise summaries. Avoid any markdown, just plain JSON. Also, ensure that the response is parseable, so proper escaping if needed, but in this case, it's straightforward.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The issue raised by the speaker concerns the feasibility of stricter national regulations on fluorinated greenhouse gases without economic harm.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"He supports the ability of member states like Austria and Denmark to maintain stricter environmental regulations.\",\n\"argSum\": \"He argues that Austria and Denmark have demonstrated that stricter regulations can be implemented without causing economic damage.\",\n\"propSum\": \"\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Dorette Corbey,", "english": "Dorette Corbey, on behalf of the PSE Group . \u2013 (NL) Mr President, first of all, I should like to express warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs\u00a0Doyle, who has given the initial impetus in several important areas in order to keep the environmental quality of these proposals intact. I look back with pleasure on her tenacity during the trialogues.\nWe have a result we can be proud of. Tomorrow, we will have achieved two milestones permanently, or at least, that is what I thought before we heard the statement.\nA first milestone has been achieved in the area of climate policy. There is broad consensus here in this House that we must take climate change seriously. Measures are needed urgently in order to reduce the level of greenhouse gases. The curtailment of f-gases constitutes a major step. F-gases are potent greenhouse gases that are used in all kinds of products, including air-conditioning and cooling systems, fire extinguishers, foam used in the construction industry and even in the soles of shoes. It is good that Parliament and the Council have drawn a clear line. Greenhouse gases must be reduced as much as possible. Innovation is important, and that is how global warming is decelerated.\nThe second milestone is of major importance politically, namely the internal market. We made our views clear at first reading. Instead of the internal market legal base, we opted for the environment-linked legal base. This was warmly supported by a majority in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament. The reason is that a number of countries had taken further measures off their own bats. With regard to the internal market legal base, Austria and Denmark were at risk of having to withdraw their more extensive measures, which is really unacceptable. The internal market should maintain a high level of environmental protection. If that is not the case, it should be possible for the Member States to take more extensive measures.\nEurope is not there to impose changes for the worse on the Member States, or to deny the Member States the scope to adopt decent environmental policy. We have managed to drive this message home at least. It is Parliament\u2019s and the Council\u2019s wish for Member States to be able to take more extensive measures. The Commission must, of course, closely monitor the situation and ensure that the restrictions of market access are proportionate.\nCommissioner, in all honesty, I find your statement lamentably insubstantial. I had at least expected you to have shown the political will to give Member States wishing to take those more extensive measures all the leg-room they need. It was really unnecessary to read out Article 95, with which we are all familiar, and we actually expect the political will from you to grant Member States this leg-room. This is what is desperately needed, because innovation is important for climate policy, but ultimately also for our economy and for the Lisbon agenda. So in that respect, I would like to see you withdraw the statement you made a moment ago. I think that we have not heard the last of this.", "lang": "NL", "original": "Dorette Corbey, namens de PSE-Fractie . \u2013 Voorzitter, allereerst wil ik mijn hartelijke dank uitspreken aan Avril Doyle. Zij heeft als rapporteur een aantal belangrijke aanzetten gegeven om de milieukwaliteit van deze voorstellen overeind te houden. Ik denk met plezier terug aan haar vasthoudendheid tijdens de trialogen.\nWe hebben een resultaat waar we trots op mogen zijn. Morgen kunnen we twee mijlpalen definitief vastzetten. Tenminste, dat dacht ik voordat we de verklaring hoorden.\nEen eerste mijlpaal is op het gebied van het klimaatbeleid bereikt. Er is een brede consensus in het Parlement dat we de klimaatverandering serieus moeten nemen. Er zijn dringend maatregelen nodig om de hoeveelheid broeikasgassen terug te dringen. Met het aan banden leggen van f-gassen zetten we een belangrijke stap. F-gassen zijn sterke broeikasgassen die gebruikt worden in allerlei producten, zoals airconditioning- en koelsystemen, brandblusapparaten, schuim voor de bouw en zelfs in schoenzolen. Het is goed dat het Parlement en de Raad een duidelijke lijn getrokken hebben. Broeikasgassen moeten zoveel mogelijk teruggedrongen worden. Innovatie is belangrijk en daarmee warmt de aarde minder op.\nDe tweede mijlpaal is politiek van groot belang en die betreft de interne markt. We hebben in de eerste lezing stevig ingezet. In plaats van de rechtsgrond interne markt kozen we voor de rechtsgrond milieu. Het merendeel van de PSE-Fractie steunde dit van harte. De reden is dat een aantal landen zelf al verdere maatregelen had genomen. Met de rechtsgrond interne markt dreigden onder andere Oostenrijk en Denemarken hun verdergaande maatregelen te moeten intrekken. Dat is echt onaanvaardbaar. De interne markt hoort uit te gaan van een hoog niveau van milieubescherming. Als dat niet het geval is, moeten de lidstaten zelf de mogelijkheid hebben om verdergaande maatregelen te nemen.\nEuropa is er niet om de lidstaten verslechteringen op te dringen of om de lidstaten de mogelijkheid te ontnemen een fatsoenlijk milieubeleid te voeren. Het is in ieder geval gelukt om dat duidelijk te maken. Parlement en Raad willen dat lidstaten verdergaande maatregelen kunnen nemen. De Commissie moet natuurlijk heel zorgvuldig kijken en ervoor zorgen dat de beperkingen van markttoegang in verhouding zijn.\nCommissaris, uw verklaring vind ik eerlijk gezegd bedroevend mager. Ik had op zijn minst verwacht dat u de politieke bereidheid zou tonen om lidstaten die verdergaande maatregelen willen nemen ruim baan te geven. Het oplezen van artikel 95, dat we allemaal kennen, was echt niet nodig geweest en we verwachten van u eigenlijk de politieke bereidheid om lidstaten die ruimte te geven. Die ruimte is heel hard nodig, want innovatie is belangrijk voor het klimaatbeleid, maar uiteindelijk ook voor onze economie en voor de agenda van Lissabon. Dus wat dat betreft, graag een intrekking van de verklaring die u zojuist heeft voorgelezen.

It has been a genuine pleasure to be a member of the conciliation delegation. On behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe I should like to offer my sincere thanks for the constructive cooperation. The outcome achieved by the conciliation committee is a victory for the European environment and for the people of Europe. Consideration has been given to countries such as Denmark and Austria, which have taken the ban on fluorinated gases further, and other countries can follow their lead. This proves that the EU puts the environment before everything else.\nWhen, tomorrow, the European Parliament adopts the conciliation committee\u2019s document by what I hope will be a very large majority, I assume that Environment Commissioner Mr\u00a0Dimas will take the opportunity to withdraw the Commission\u2019s letter of formal notice addressed to Denmark. That should be a natural consequence of this new statutory text. Now that the Community legislation has been changed, there will be no basis for taking legal proceedings against Denmark at the European Court of Justice.\nIt was depressing to hear in the corridors that the Commission\u2019s legal service has refused to accept the outcome of the conciliation or has tried to misinterpret it. Allow me to remind the Commission that it would be quite unprecedented and completely unacceptable if the new Community legislation were not administered by the Commission. It would also be detrimental to cooperation with, and confidence in, the Commission. The Council and the European Parliament have approved the agreement and the content of the conciliation document. The Commission was a party to the agreement of 31\u00a0January 2006 and is therefore partly responsible for it.

The user provided a debate summary about fluorinated greenhouse gases and wants the main points from Caroline Lucas's speech. First, I need to locate her contributions in the summary.\n\nLooking through the executive summary, under the \"Environmental vs. Market Considerations\" section, Caroline Lucas is mentioned. She called the regulation \"a tragedy of missed opportunity and sets back the potential of our climate policy by decades.\" That's her main argument. \n\nNow, I need to structure the response into the four JSON fields: issueSum, positionSum, argSum, propSum. \n\nFor issueSum, the key issue is the regulation's failure to adequately address climate policy. PositionSum should state her stance that the regulation is a setback. The argument is that it misses an opportunity, and the proposal would be her call for stronger measures. \n\nWait, the user said not to include other speakers' points. So I need to make sure only Caroline's points are included. The example response uses specific quotes. The user's example has \"issueSum\" as the key issue, \"positionSum\" as her position, \"argSum\" as the reasoning, and \"propSum\" as her proposals. \n\nIn the debate summary, Caroline Lucas's exact words are \"a tragedy of missed opportunity and sets back the potential of our climate policy by decades.\" So her position is opposing the regulation, arguing it's insufficient. The argument is that it's a missed opportunity. There's no specific proposal mentioned, just criticism. So propSum might be empty. \n\nWait, the user's example has propSum as a proposal. But in the debate summary, does Caroline Lucas suggest any proposals? The summary says she \"called the regulation 'a tragedy...'\". There's no mention of specific proposals from her, just her criticism. So propSum would be an empty string. \n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nissueSum: The key issue is the regulation's failure to adequately address climate policy.\npositionSum: She opposes the regulation, calling it a setback for climate policy.\nargSum: Her argument is that the regulation represents a missed opportunity.\npropSum: None, as there's no proposal mentioned.\n\nI need to make sure the JSON is correctly formatted and only includes her points.

We are not satisfied with the content, and we are definitely not satisfied with the legal basis. That is not a criticism of the rapporteur. We believe that Mrs\u00a0Doyle has done the best she possibly could in a difficult situation and has tried to go as far as humanly possible in claiming the right to retain and to introduce better environmental requirements. Given, however, the very weak position in which she found herself following Parliament\u2019s second reading, she was unable to achieve the only reasonable objective, namely that of having environmental Article 175 adopted as the only legal basis. For us, the only acceptable outcome is for environmental legislation to be allowed to be precisely that.\nWe see two problems with this compromise. The first problem is that, in our view, larger steps could have been taken where various parts of it were concerned. More rapid progress can be made in abolishing these very dangerous greenhouse gases. The most serious consideration of all, however, is that there is now an active risk of putting obstacles in the way of countries that want to tighten up their national legislation in this area. This situation violates the spirit of the Kyoto Protocol and could be an obstacle to countries that wish to combat climate change which, as we all know, is the most serious environmental threat we face.\nWhere Denmark and Austria are concerned, they are to be given a guarantee up until the year 2012, whereupon the guarantee will come to an end. We shall then not know what is to happen, and there will again be a danger of these countries actively being forced to curb the legislation they already have. Where other countries are concerned, there would in actual fact be an end to reform if the Commission does not take a different decision. This situation is completely unacceptable.\nIt also means that countries within the EU will have difficulty producing new technology \u2013 which is precisely what this document says they should be doing \u2013 with a view to taking the lead by banning dangerous gases and forcing alternatives to be produced using just such new technology. By their action, the Council and the Commission are preventing new technology from being produced. In our debates, we usually agree on the seriousness of climate issues, and we usually agree with the researchers\u2019 reports we see, saying that the situation is more serious than we believed a few years ago. Then comes this statement from the Commission, showing that it has learned nothing about climate issues. What you are saying is that the market remains more important than the environment. Companies\u2019 right to sell dangerous gases is more important than political opportunities to combat the greenhouse effect and climate change. It is remarkable that such a thing can be said in 2006.\n(Applause from various quarters)", "lang": "SV", "original": "Jonas Sj\u00f6stedt, f\u00f6r GUE/NGL-gruppen . \u2013 Herr talman!

The Commission will thus be a party to the compromise reached between the Council and Parliament in the conciliation procedure. The undertaking is particularly gratifying because the Commission had adopted a declaration, reserving to itself the right to declare the Austrian and Danish bans on fluorinated gases unlawful. The declaration was a provocation, which we can now put to one side.\nI should like to thank Mr\u00a0Barroso and Mr\u00a0Verheugen for their personal support in this matter, and I should also like to thank the President of the European Council, Mr\u00a0Sch\u00fcssel, who has offered his personal support in relation to a matter that was initially dropped by the Council of Ministers when Austria took over the Presidency. There are also, in fact, reasons for thanking ourselves here in this Chamber, because we voted in favour of the much discussed Amendment\u00a045, which made the victory possible. By means of amendments we shall turn the decision concerning fluorinated gases into a minimal rule in which countries are given permission to go further in protecting our common climate. Three hundred and sixty-seven votes are needed if we elected representatives are to have real influence, and we obtained 370. We therefore owe the Chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, Mr\u00a0Florenz, and the rapporteur, Mrs\u00a0Doyle a considerable debt of gratitude because they stood firm in their support for minimal rules, even though they were exposed to heavy pressure, including from their own group.\nI also wish especially to congratulate those responsible for now creating a clear precedent for our being able to introduce minimal rules, even when the legal base is the internal market\u2019s provisions. We are obtaining a greater number of possible ways of taking account of security, health, the environment, the working environment, consumer protection and animal welfare, and we are moving a step away from regimentation and from what is referred to as total harmonisation. I hope that this will not be an isolated development but, on the contrary, will herald a new direction for European cooperation. People will thank us if, by means of majority decisions, we secure a common level of protection and, at the same time, give countries permission to be pioneers. In this way, everyone will sense that progress has been made. Danes and Austrians will be quite uncomprehending if the Commission makes its efforts to combat climate change a political priority and, at the same time, punishes Denmark and Austria for making a special effort.\nMr\u00a0Verheugen, Mr\u00a0Dimas and Mr\u00a0Barroso would be uncomprehending, too. The Eurocrats in the departments of the Commission have now hopefully been put in their place. We representatives of the people have made a difference, and we can be proud of our joint efforts. The next task must, of course, be that of convincing all the countries that there are technical alternatives, so that we might obtain a common EU ban on fluorinated gases, preferably before 2012 when the Kyoto Agreement is to be renewed in a spirit of consideration for future generations.

Og jeg vil gerne takke formanden for Det Europ\u00e6iske R\u00e5d, Wolfgang Sch\u00fcssel, som har givet sin personlige st\u00f8tte i en sag, som i f\u00f8rste omgang var tabt p\u00e5 gulvet i Ministerr\u00e5det, da \u00d8strig overtog formandskabet. Og s\u00e5 er der faktisk grund til at takke os selv her i salen, fordi vi stemte for den meget omtalte \u00e6ndring nr. 45, som muliggjorde sejren. Med \u00e6ndringsforslag vil vi g\u00f8re F-gasbeslutningen til en minimumsregel, hvor landene f\u00e5r lov til at g\u00e5 l\u00e6ngere i beskyttelsen af vores f\u00e6lles klima. Der skal 367 stemmer til reel indflydelse for os folkevalgte - vi fik 370 stemmer! Og vi skylder derfor formanden for milj\u00f8udvalget, Karl-Heinz Florenz, og ordf\u00f8reren, Avril Doyle, en stor tak, fordi de stod fast p\u00e5 deres st\u00f8tte til minimumsregler, selv om de blev udsat for st\u00e6rkt pres - herunder i deres egen gruppe.\nOg jeg vil s\u00e6rligt sige tillykke, fordi der nu er skabt en klar pr\u00e6cedens for, at vi kan indf\u00f8re minimumsregler, ogs\u00e5 n\u00e5r hjemlen er det indre markeds bestemmelser. Vi f\u00e5r flere muligheder for at tage hensyn til sikkerhed, sundhed, milj\u00f8, arbejdsmilj\u00f8, forbrugerbeskyttelse og dyrevelf\u00e6rd. Vi g\u00e5r et skridt v\u00e6k fra ensretning og s\u00e5kaldt totalharmonisering. Jeg h\u00e5ber ikke, det bliver en enlig svale men derimod en ny retning for det europ\u00e6iske samarbejde. Borgerne vil takke os, hvis vi med flertalsbeslutninger sikrer et f\u00e6lles beskyttelsesniveau og samtidig giver lande lov til at v\u00e6re foregangslande. P\u00e5 den m\u00e5de oplever alle borgere fremskridt. Ingen danskere eller \u00f8strigere vil kunne forst\u00e5, hvis Kommissionen g\u00f8r sin indsats mod klima\u00e6ndringer til en politisk prioritet og samtidig vil straffe Danmark og \u00d8strig for at g\u00f8re en s\u00e6rlig indsats.\nDet kunne hr. Verheugen, hr. Dimas og hr. Barroso heller ikke. Eurokraterne i Kommissionens tjenestegrene bliver nu forh\u00e5bentlig sat p\u00e5 plads. Vi folkevalgte har gjort en forskel.

The regulation and directive before us are both important steps in our objective to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. From experience I know that heading the conciliation process is an exacting task that makes great demands on the rapporteur.\nFluorinated greenhouse gases are one example of how difficult it is to solve environmental problems. You solve one and new ones can easily come along to take its place.\nWhen at one time we switched to using fluorinated hydrocarbons in cooling systems, aerosols and other applications, we succeeded in dramatically reducing the use of chlorofluoride hydrocarbons, which make the ozone layer thinner. The Montreal Protocol was an attempt to phase out CFCs, as these gases are harmful to stratospheric ozone. That was a good thing, but agents that make the ozone layer thinner were replaced by powerful greenhouse gases. Their potential for global warming is 100 or even 1\u00a0000 times greater than carbon dioxide, and the time the gases take to disperse into the atmosphere can be very long indeed. Fluorinated gases account for at least 5% of the greenhouse phenomenon. This is why the threat of climate change means we need to cut down on the use of fluorinated hydrocarbons.\nThe text for a regulation now adopted by the Conciliation Committee will encourage the continued development of alternative technologies and the adoption of existing technologies, nevertheless making possible sustainable operational models to achieve the objective. Hopefully, we are now wiser than we used to be and will continue to be better able to predict the possible dangers of alternative solutions.\nOne of the biggest problems with the regulation under discussion was its legal basis. I hope that the two legal bases now chosen will prove, despite everything, to be a workable compromise and will not cause problems of overlap. At the time, I voted for one legal basis, Article\u00a095, but with the highest standards. I have always wondered why environmental grounds are always automatically thought to be more environmentally friendly, while those for the internal market are branded as being in the interests of industry. It would be in the environment\u2019s best interests to combine a harmonised market with ambitious targets.

There's no specific proposal mentioned, just her emphasis on prioritizing climate protection.\n\nI need to structure this into the JSON format as per the example.

Austria may well, unfortunately, not always be a model pupil when it comes to environmental policy, but on the issue of fluorinated greenhouse gases we have stricter measures than were proposed in the package of harmonised legislation. In my view, the European Union has two choices: either we harmonise at a high, ambitious level, or we continue to allow the Member States to retain their stricter, more ambitious targets and measures.\nAustria and Denmark \u2013 as has frequently been mentioned, including, commendably, by the rapporteur, who has continually defended this position \u2013 have laid down general bans on the use of fluorinated greenhouse gases. Experience in those countries has shown that there are alternatives to these gases. The draft approved by the Conciliation Committee at the end of January provides that Member States may retain stricter national requirements until 2012. This step is possible under Article 95(10) of the Treaty \u2013 the 'safeguard clause', which allows stricter measures to be retained temporarily.\nThe European Parliament and the Council have agreed on such a safeguard clause. This ensures \u2013 at least for the time being \u2013 that Austria and Denmark can continue to apply their stricter regulations. It also means that the scientific evidence referred to in Article 95(4) need not be provided.

First, I need to look through the debate summary and find all mentions of J\u00e1n Fige\u013e.\n\nLooking at the summary, under the \"Core Issues and Positions\" section, there's a mention of Commission representative J\u00e1n Fige\u013e. He defended the legislation, stating that it would cut emissions by 20 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent annually by 2012. He also mentioned reservations about stricter national measures to ensure Treaty compliance.\n\nNow, the user wants only the points attributed to J\u00e1n Fige\u013e. The other parts of the summary talk about other speakers like Avril Doyle, Richard Seeber, etc., but those shouldn't be included. \n\nSo, the issueSum should mention the EU regulations on F-gases and the balance between environmental protection and market harmonization. The positionSum is his defense of the legislation and his reservations about national measures. The argument is that the legislation would reduce emissions, and the proposal is maintaining the legislation while allowing some national measures. Wait, but the user said not to include other speakers' points. Wait, the example response includes \"He supports...\" but in the debate summary, Fige\u013e is the one who said the emission reduction. So the argSum would be based on the emission estimates. The propSum would be his support for the legislation and the safeguard clause? Wait, the summary says he maintained reservations about stricter national measures to ensure Treaty compliance. So maybe the propSum is about the legislation's effectiveness and ensuring Treaty compliance. But the user's example has propSum as a proposal. However, in the debate summary, Fige\u013e's contribution is more about defending the legislation and his reservations. So the propSum might be the legislation's phased ban, but the user's example includes \"advocates for strict limitations...\" so maybe in this case, the propSum is his support for the legislation and the safeguard clause. Wait, the original debate summary says the compromise allows member states to maintain stricter measures until 2012 through a safeguard clause, but Fige\u013e's part is about his reservations. So perhaps the propSum is that he supports the legislation but has reservations about national measures. But the user's example has propSum as a proposal. Maybe the actual proposals from Fige\u013e are the legislation itself and the safeguard clause. However, the user's instruction says to only include points attributed to the speaker. Since the summary says Fige\u013e defended the legislation, his position is supporting it, and his arguments are the emission reduction. The propSum would be the legislation's measures. But the user's example has \"advocates for strict limitations...\" so maybe in this case, the propSum is his support for the legislation and the safeguard clause. However, the exact wording from the summary is that he \"maintained reservations about stricter national measures to ensure Treaty compliance.\" So maybe the propSum is about ensuring Treaty compliance while allowing the legislation. But I need to structure this into the four fields: issueSum, positionSum, argSum, propSum.\n\nSo:\n\nissueSum: The key issue is the EU regulations on F-gases, balancing environmental protection and market harmonization.\n\npositionSum: Fige\u013e defended the legislation, stating it would cut emissions, and had reservations about stricter national measures to ensure Treaty compliance.\n\nargSum: His argument is based on the estimated emission reductions and ensuring legal consistency with the Treaty.\n\npropSum: He supported the legislation's measures, including the phased ban, while allowing member states to maintain stricter measures under a safeguard clause until 2012.\n\nWait, but the original summary says that the compromise allows member states to maintain stricter measures through a safeguard clause, but Fige\u013e's part is about his reservations. So maybe the propSum is his support for the legislation and the safeguard clause. But the user's example has \"propSum\" as a proposal. So perhaps the propSum is the legislation's provisions, like the phased ban and the safeguard clause. However, the user's instruction says to only include points attributed to the speaker. Since Fige\u013e is the Commission representative, his role is to present the legislation, so the propSum would be the legislation's elements. But the user's example has \"He advocates for strict limitations...\" which is a proposal. So in this case, the propSum would be his support for the legislation's provisions, including the safeguard clause. But the summary doesn't explicitly say he proposed it; it's the legislation that includes the safeguard clause. So maybe the propSum is that he supports the legislation's measures, including the phased ban and the safeguard clause. However, the user's example shows that propSum is a specific action, like advocating for limitations. So perhaps in this case, the propSum is his support for the legislation and the safeguard clause. But I need to check the exact wording from the debate summary.\n\nIn the debate summary, under \"Key Proposals and Outcomes,\" it says the legislation includes a phased ban and a safeguard clause. But Fige\u013e's contribution is defending the legislation and his reservations about national measures. So the propSum would be the legislation's provisions, but since he's the Commission rep, he's presenting the legislation. Therefore, the propSum would be the legislation's measures, but the user's example has \"propSum\" as a proposal. However, the user's instruction says to only include points attributed to the speaker. Since Fige\u013e is part of the Commission, his role is to propose the legislation, so the propSum would be the legislation's elements. But the user's example has \"He advocates for strict limitations...\" which is a proposal. So maybe in this case, the propSum is the legislation's provisions. However, the user's example also includes \"He advocates for strict limitations...\" which is a proposal. So perhaps the propSum here is the legislation's measures, but I need to structure it based on the debate summary.\n\nIn the debate summary, Fige\u013e's exact words are: \"The Commission estimates that the legislation that we are discussing today will, by 2012, cut emissions of fluorinated gases by some 20 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent annually\" [Fige\u013e]. He also \"maintained reservations about stricter national measures to ensure Treaty compliance.\"\n\nSo the propSum would be the legislation's measures, but since he's the one defending it, the propSum is supporting the legislation's emission cuts and the safeguard clause. However, the user's example has \"propSum\" as a specific action. So maybe the propSum is the legislation's phased ban and the safeguard clause. But the user's example has \"advocates for strict limitations...\" which is a proposal.

The user provided a debate summary and wants the main points from Avril Doyle (PPE-DE). First, I need to go through the summary and find all mentions of her.\n\nLooking at the sections, under \"Core Issues and Positions,\" there's a quote from Avril Doyle. She supports the legislation but criticizes the Commission's restrictive interpretation. She argues against the Commission's narrow view of the legal base, wanting member states to maintain stricter standards. \n\nThen, in the \"Commission Internal Dynamics\" section, she questions if there's a conflict between DG Enterprise and DG Environment, suggesting business interests might override environmental concerns. \n\nI need to make sure I only include her points. The other parts mention other speakers, so I'll ignore those. The issueSum should mention the legal base and member states' rights. PositionSum is her support for legislation but opposing the Commission's stance. The argument is about allowing national measures. Proposals would be her call for the Commission to not restrict legal base. \n\nWait, the example response has specific fields. Let me structure each part. IssueSum is the key issue she raised. PositionSum is her stance. ArgSum is the reasoning. PropSum is her proposals. \n\nI need to check if there are other mentions. The \"Member State Rights and Legal Basis Disputes\" section has her supporting the legislation but the user's example might not have that. Wait, in the summary, she's the rapporteur and her quotes are in the core issues and the commission dynamics. \n\nSo, the JSON should have:\n\nissueSum: The key issue is the legal base for member states to maintain stricter measures.\n\npositionSum: She supports the legislation but opposes the Commission's restrictive interpretation.\n\nargSum: She argues that the legislation should allow member states to keep stricter standards.\n\npropSum: She calls for the Commission to not narrowly interpret the legal base.\n\nI need to make sure there's no other info.

Let me start by reading through the summary again to make sure I don't miss anything.\n\nThe debate is about EU regulations on fluorinated greenhouse gases (F-gases), specifically in motor vehicle air-conditioning systems. The key points mentioned are the tension between environmental protection and market harmonization. The user wants the main points or arguments made by J\u00e1n Fige\u013e, the Commission representative.\n\nLooking at the summary, under the \"Core Issues and Positions\" section, there's a mention of J\u00e1n Fige\u013e defending the legislation. He states that the legislation would cut emissions by 20 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent annually by 2012. However, he has reservations about stricter national measures to ensure Treaty compliance. \n\nSo, the issue here is the balance between environmental protection and internal market considerations. His position is supporting the legislation but being cautious about national measures that might conflict with the Treaty. The argument he uses is the need to ensure legal compliance, and the proposal is the legislation itself, which includes the phased ban on F-gases. \n\nWait, but the user's example response includes issueSum, positionSum, argSum, propSum. Let me structure that.\n\nIssueSum: The key issue is the balance between environmental protection and internal market harmonization, with F-gases in vehicle AC systems as the focus.\n\nPositionSum: Fige\u013e supports the legislation but has reservations about stricter national measures to maintain Treaty compliance.\n\nArgSum: His argument is to ensure that the legislation complies with the Treaty, possibly to avoid legal issues.\n\nPropSum: The legislation's phased ban on F-gases with specific deadlines.\n\nBut I need to check if there's more. The summary also mentions that he's defending the legislation's estimated emission cuts. So maybe the issue is the effectiveness of the legislation. But the user's example has the issueSum as the key issue, so maybe the main issue is the trade-off between environmental goals and market rules.\n\nWait, the user's example for issueSum is about trade secrets and intellectual property. So in this case, the issue is the balance between environmental protection and internal market harmonization. \n\nPositionSum: He supports the legislation but is concerned about national measures conflicting with the Treaty. \n\nArgSum: He argues that the legislation will reduce emissions significantly, but he's cautious about national measures to ensure legal compliance.\n\nPropSum: The legislation's phased ban on F-gases, allowing member states to maintain stricter measures until 2012 via a safeguard clause.\n\nWait, but the user's example for propSum is about limitations on government data demands. So here, the proposal would be the legislation's phased ban and the safeguard clause. However, the user's instructions say to only include points attributed to the speaker. The summary says Fige\u013e defended the legislation, so the proposal is the legislation itself, which includes the phased ban. But the safeguard clause is part of the compromise, which the summary mentions as allowing member states to maintain stricter measures until 2012. However, the user's example for propSum is a specific action, so maybe the propSum here is the legislation's phased ban.\n\nBut I need to make sure. The user's example for propSum is \"He advocates for strict limitations on government demands for private data\". So in this case, the speaker's proposal would be the legislation's measures. But Fige\u013e's role was defending the legislation, so his proposal is the legislation's phased ban. However, the summary says that the legislation includes the phased ban, but Fige\u013e's own proposals might not be detailed beyond defending the legislation. \n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nissueSum: The key issue is balancing environmental protection with internal market harmonization regarding F-gases in vehicle air-conditioning systems.\n\npositionSum: Fige\u013e supports the legislation to reduce emissions but has reservations about stricter national measures to ensure Treaty compliance.\n\nargSum: He argues that the legislation will cut emissions significantly, but he emphasizes the need for legal consistency with the Treaty.\n\npropSum: The legislation's phased ban on F-gases with specific deadlines, allowing member states to maintain stricter measures until 2012 via a safeguard clause.\n\nBut I need to check if the safeguard clause is part of the legislation he's defending. The summary says the compromise allows member states to maintain stricter measures until 2012 through a safeguard clause, but Fige\u013e's position is that he has reservations about stricter national measures. So maybe the propSum is the legislation's phased ban, and the safeguard clause is part of the compromise, not his own proposal. \n\nAlternatively, since the user's example includes propSum as a specific action, perhaps the propSum here is the legislation's phased ban. However, the user's example for propSum is a proposal, so in this case, the proposal is the legislation's measures. But the summary says Fige\u013e \"defended the proposed legislation\", so his proposal is the legislation itself, which includes the phased ban. \n\nTherefore, the JSON should reflect that.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The key issue is balancing environmental protection with internal market harmonization regarding fluorinated greenhouse gases (F-gases) in motor vehicle air-conditioning systems.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"J\u00e1n Fige\u013e defended the proposed legislation, emphasizing its environmental benefits while expressing reservations about stricter national measures to ensure compliance with EU Treaty obligations.\",\n\"argSum\": \"He argued that the legislation would significantly reduce emissions by 20 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent annually by 2012, but stressed the need to maintain legal consistency with the Treaty to avoid conflicts over national regulations.\",\n\"propSum\": \"The legislation includes a phased ban on F-gases with global warming potential over 150 times that of CO2 in motor vehicles, with implementation timelines set for 2011 and 2017.\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "President.", "english": "President.
