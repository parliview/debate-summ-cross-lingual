One could say that we are dealing with a Greek tragedy, but one that affects other EU citizens. On the Committee on Petitions, above all other committees, I believe we have to put aside our national and party political obligations and allegiances in order to deliver natural justice for the citizens who approach us.\nWe have received numerous petitions from citizens across the EU concerning confiscation of their cars by the Greek authorities. The petitioners have stated that Greece has not properly implemented Directive 83/182/EEC, which concerns conditions for the exemption of certain taxes and excise duties for EU citizens who are normally resident \u2013 and that is key \u2013 in another Member State. The Greek authorities have also imposed disproportionately high administrative penalties and confiscated petitioners\u2019 property, claiming that those concerned were attempting to evade tax payments. The petitioners have been asked, in some instances, to pay up to ten times the level of customs duties without any due recognition of the actual value of the motor vehicle.\nThis report has been discussed several times in committee and was adopted by a large majority at the end of November. The petitioners came to present their petition, explaining that, in some cases, they have had to pay fees and fines of up to EUR\u00a045\u00a0000 to retrieve their property, after the Greek authorities had impounded and confiscated their vehicles. Both I, as rapporteur, and the chairman of the Committee on Petitions have been in regular contact with the Greek authorities to try and resolve these issues and the cases that are currently before them.\nAn amendment to the law on the Greek national customs code has been adopted by the Greek Parliament. However, I am informed that this law still gives the Greek Government the power to confiscate vehicles in this situation. It is worth remembering that the petitioners have fulfilled the conditions for exemption, laid down in Directive 83/182/EEC, from, in particular, turnover tax, excise duty and other consumption tax, in respect of temporary imports from another Member State of motor-driven road vehicles. All the petitioners have their normal residence \u2013 i.e., the place where they live at least 185 days in each calendar year, because of personal or occupational ties \u2013 in a Member State other than Greece; that is, they fulfil the conditions laid down in the directive.\nThe petitioners were also able to give absolute proof of their normal place of residence by appropriate means, such as identity cards or other valid documents. Furthermore, the imposition of a special administrative penalty and, in particular, of fines set at a flat rate on the basis of the sole criterion of the cubic capacity of the vehicle \u2013 with no account being taken of the age of that vehicle \u2013 as well as of an increased duty, which, in some cases, can amount to up to ten times the taxes in question, is \u2013 not only in my opinion, but in the opinion of the Commission \u2013 incompatible with the Community principle of proportionality.\nFinally, I hope that the adoption of this report will send a very strong signal to the Greek authorities that they must amend their law so that it is in conformity with the EU directives that I have referred to.

Mr President, I am pleased to contribute to this debate on the confiscation of cars in Greece. I have read, and now I have heard, Mr Cashman\u2019s report with great interest, and I share all the concerns expressed in it. The issues highlighted in the report are of great importance not only for this specific case but also as regards their impact on the Commission initiatives in the field of car taxation and the fundamental rights of citizens.\nLet me say a few words on the case in question. In addition to the numerous petitions received by Parliament, the Commission has received a great number of complaints over recent years about an administrative practice which leads to the confiscation of cars. I do not intend to go deeply into technical details, but, as you know, Community law allows a citizen resident in one Member State \u2013 I emphasise \u2018resident\u2019 and not \u2018national\u2019 \u2013 to use his or her car for personal reasons in another Member State without being obliged to register his or her car in that other Member State, provided certain conditions are met. One of these conditions is that the use in the other Member State does not exceed six months in one year.\nThe application of this directive has been quite problematic in Greece. It has led to an administrative practice which, unfortunately, has disregarded the fact that, in many cases, the normal residence of Greek citizens is in a state other than Greece. This practice penalises mostly Greek nationals who do not live and work in Greece on a permanent basis. The outcome has been, as you can see from the report, the imposition of very high fines resulting in the confiscation of the vehicles concerned, followed sometimes by their sale at auction, even before a national judge could come to a decision on the case. The Commission has also been informed in the past that, in some cases, this has led to prison sentences. For these reasons, the Commission has launched an infringement procedure and brought the case before the European Court of Justice.\nLet me stress that it is neither the intention nor to the benefit of the Commission to single out one Member State instead of another, since in one way or another every Member State faces its own difficulties in the path towards the realisation of a real internal market, where fundamental freedoms and the respect of Community law should be guaranteed.\nTo a large extent, car taxation is not yet harmonised at Community level. Nevertheless, the freedom that Member States enjoy has to be exercised within the framework laid down by the directives applicable in this field and within the general principles of Community law, which represent the fundamentals of the construction of the European Union.\nWhen an individual incurs significant adverse economic consequences if he or she seeks to make use of his of her car for a certain period of time in another Member State, especially when this is allowed by Community law, this represents a risk to the free movement of citizens within the Union.\nIt is also true that Member States are free to determine the fines that they feel are adequate for an infringement of their laws, assuming that an infringement really occurs. However, they should respect the principle of proportionality. A practice which also disregards the evidence that residence is maintained in a Member State or which imposes high fines without taking into account the good faith of the offender should also be rectified.\nThe Commission, at this stage, has taken all the necessary steps allowed by the Treaty in order to tackle this situation. However, the Commission welcomes an initiative like this, which allows a further reflection on the impact that vehicle taxation has on the life of EU citizens.\nTo conclude, let me say that, looking at the broader perspective, the Commission is not only proceeding with its infringement policy but is also taking a proactive approach in the field of legislative proposals. In July 2005, the Commission adopted my proposal on a draft directive on car taxation, which is intended to remove existing tax obstacles to the transfer of passenger cars from one Member State to another and thus improve the functioning of the internal market. One of the objectives of the proposal is the abolition of the registration tax in order to incorporate it into the annual circulation tax over a period of five to ten years. The proposal is currently being discussed in various parliamentary committees and in the Council, and I call for your support on this matter.\nI thank you for your attention and look forward to the debate.", "lang": "EN", "original": "L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs, Member of the Commission .

It is based in essence on fewer than a dozen petitions prior to 2004, the authors of which have either reached a compromise with the Greek authorities or are in court and need support.\nI shall refer to three issues: as far as the relationship of the report to the functioning of the Committee on Petitions is concerned, I wish to comment that it is scandalous that, even though one was requested officially, the written opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs of the European Parliament was never given on the extent to which, while proceedings are pending both before the Court of Justice of the European Communities and before the national courts, it is possible for a report to be drafted and to be put to the vote before the European Parliament. Is this not discriminatory treatment of citizens for whose petitions a report was not drafted precisely because proceedings were pending?\nAs to the content, petitions from just one Member State, Greece, were selected, even though there is also confusion about the use of private cars with foreign number plates in the other 24 Member States. That is precisely why the Commission proposed a new proposal for a directive, as you said, and took Greece to the Court of Justice of the European Communities for infringement on the basis of the 1983 directive. As a result, Greek legislation was amended, both by the socialist government of Greece in 2001 and more recently by the New Democracy government in 2005, which is something the report ignores. So why was the report drafted? The few specific petitions which resulted in the drafting of this report are not representative, but their authors give the impression that they have personal relations of goodwill with Parliament. The Committee on Petitions does not have the right to play the role of judge and to construe as true, without proof, information such as the place of normal residence, on which the courts are called to rule.\nThe report started with an assumed number of petitions of 40 and it transpired that there were few petitions, of which some have been closed with a compromise and others are pending before the courts. I call on my honourable friends in all the groups to vote against the report and to give the Committee on Petitions the authority it deserves, with respect for the rule of law and without intervention in the work of justice.\nI trust, Commissioner, that the proposed new 2005 directive will have a favourable and speedy outcome.", "lang": "EL", "original": "\u039c\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03b1

I would refer by way of example to the example of the petition on dismissals from the SY.EL.AE fertiliser factory, a matter on which the drafting of a report was requested but which was never drafted, however, on the grounds that proceedings were pending.\nSecondly, the report only concerns Greece, at a time when similar petitions have also been filed for other Member States of the European Union. The obvious conclusion from this is that European citizens are subject to discriminatory treatment by the European Parliament itself.\nLet us look now at the report, the petitions and the data: Community directive 83/182 on tax exemptions lays down the preconditions for application of the scheme for the temporary importation and transportation of automobiles for private use. It does not stipulate the fines imposed, for which the Member States are competent. Greek legislation on the fines was adopted in order to suppress fraud in the automobile sector, at a time when it was rife. Besides, the fines do not relate solely to individuals; they also relate to dealers and organised groups that are demonstrably trying to evade taxes.\nWith respect to the non-application of the rule of proportionality, which the report cites for the imposition of fines on the basis solely of the cubic capacity of the vehicle, the court notes that the adoption of such measures is needed for reasons of suppression and prevention. Greek legislation has already been improved with law 2960/2001 abolishing the penalty of smuggling and confiscation of vehicles and making provision solely for temporary seizure pending payment of a fine in order to secure the Greek state. As a result, the courts have handed down acquittals in respect of the criminal element, but not in respect of the fines.\nAs far as the fines are concerned, a bill was tabled before the Greek parliament on 22 December 2005, which makes provision for reductions and for the application of temporary seizure in exceptional cases only. It is, I think, clear that we are all defending the application of the acquis communautaire , while at the same time recognising crucial differences between the Member States.", "lang": "EL",

We do not deal with a country\u2019s internal affairs, quite the opposite: we deal with cases of European citizens whose rights have been violated.\nThat is what the Committee on Petitions does. We are neither the judge nor one of the parties. We in the Committee on Petitions do not make any decisions. We are mediators. We respond to the European citizens.\nIn this case, I believe that the majority of members of the Committee on Petitions believe that rights and directives have been violated and that the Greek authorities\u2019 practice of confiscating cars and the practice of imposing astronomical fines are totally unacceptable.\nThere is a clear violation of Directive 83/182, and that affects the whole of Europe. An Administration must not fund itself nor act in such an unclear and unjust manner towards its citizens and ultimately towards all of the Europeans who wish to visit that beautiful, wonderful and historic country of Greece. We want to be able to visit Greece without fear of our car being taken away, or of the other things that happen there.\nFinally, I would like to thank the Commission\u2019s technical team for the excellent, exemplary work of mediation and communication it has done, which has been professional and, I believe, very effective.

Mr President, I have listened to the debate attentively and I wish to comment on a few aspects.\nIt is true that since the beginning of the infringement procedure, the situation has improved in the Member State concerned. I would like to recall that until a few years ago the fines imposed were those applying to infringement of the customs legislation and also that smuggling was one of the crimes envisaged by the national law. This, fortunately, is no longer the case and the Commission wants to express its satisfaction at the progress made. However, further steps still have to be taken to align national practice with Community law.\nLet me clarify one important point: the high registration taxes on vehicles that are applied in some Member States on the occasion of a permanent transfer of residence are a completely different issue from the one dealt with in Mr Cashman\u2019s report.\nOn the one hand, the determination of the amount of registration tax due when a person registers a car in one state depends on the tax policy of the Member State concerned. European law \u2013 particularly the prohibition of discrimination against imported goods in favour of domestic goods \u2013 may have a bearing with respect to how the tax is calculated, especially with respect to the value attributed to second-hand cars. However, Community law does not prevent a Member State from applying a high registration tax on vehicles.\nOn the other hand, Mr Cashman\u2019s report deals with the application of an existing directive, which allows a temporary use of a vehicle in another Member State without the obligation to re-register it. I would add that this is an issue of concrete application of Community law by national authorities. The report concerns, inter alia, the interpretation of the concept of \u2018normal residence\u2019 by the national authorities, which runs counter to the principles enshrined in the directive itself.\nIn fact, the directive is able to function properly only if a person who resides in one Member State is allowed to use his vehicle in the territory of a Member State other than that where the normal residence is located. If evidence of residence in the first state is not accepted or is rendered difficult by the second state, the directive has no chance of being applied correctly. I would also remind you that the issue concerns the freedom to provide and receive services in another Member State. This is the core point of the case being discussed now.\nBefore concluding, I wish to react to some of the issues and questions raised by some of the participants in the debate. It is true that other Member States are also infringing Community law, but these infringements are in connection with other aspects of car taxation, such as discrimination in levying registration tax, and there has been no confiscation of cars, which also points to the lack of proportionality.\nAnother issue raised during the debate was whether it was legal or legitimate that actions are being taken when the European Court of Justice is still discussing the case. We sought the opinion of Parliament\u2019s Legal Service. It had no objections, and the Commission is certainly not in a position to review the view of Parliament\u2019s Legal Service.\nTo conclude, I want to say that in this case, bearing in mind that the Commission is still receiving complaints on this issue, the Commission has taken all the action possible. A case is pending before the European Court of Justice. Of course this pending case does not in any way prevent a Member State that wishes to comply with Community Law from changing its legislation in the meantime before the decision is issued. We have indeed heard that Greece has drafted or is drawing up legislation, but as we have not received any official signal from the Greek authorities, we cannot give our opinion on it.\nThe Commission very much welcomes the encouraging signals that it has received from the Greek authorities during the debates in Parliament and would also welcome this being consolidated by the adoption of the new law.\nThank you very much for your attention.", "lang": "EN", "original": "L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs, Member of the Commission .

Debate Information**\n\n- **Debate Title:** Confiscation of automobiles by the Greek authorities\n- **Date:** [Date not provided in contributions]\n- **Number of Contributions Analyzed:** 11 (named speakers: Michael Cashman, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs, Marie Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou, Maria Matsouka, David Hammerstein Mintz, Alessandro Battilocchio; some speakers contributed multiple times)\n- **Topic:** Examination of the Greek authorities' practices regarding the confiscation of automobiles, notably with respect to compliance with EU law\u2014particularly Directive 83/182/EEC\u2014and the impact on EU citizens, procedural fairness, proportionality of penalties, and necessary legal reforms.\n\n---\n\n**2. Executive Summary**\n\nThis parliamentary debate centers on serious concerns raised about the Greek authorities\u2019 practice of confiscating automobiles from EU citizens, particularly those visiting or residing temporarily in Greece, and imposing severe fines frequently deemed disproportionate to the alleged offenses. The discussions covered both the legality and proportionality of Greek actions under EU law, the adequacy of recent Greek legal reforms, the scope of the European Parliament's intervention, and the need for harmonization at the EU level. The debate highlighted perspectives from European Commissioners, Parliamentarians, and Greek representatives.\n\n---\n\n**Key Issues Raised:**\n\n1. **Compliance with EU Law and Proportionality of Penalties**\n   - Multiple speakers (notably Michael Cashman, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs, David Hammerstein Mintz, Alessandro Battilocchio) argued that Greek practices breach Directive 83/182/EEC, by imposing \u201cdisproportionately high administrative penalties and confiscated petitioners\u2019 property\u201d [Cashman, Speaker 2] and deploying \u201cfines set at a flat rate on the basis of the sole criterion of the cubic capacity of the vehicle... incompatible with the Community principle of proportionality\u201d [Cashman, Speaker 2].\n   - The European Commission, represented by L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs, consistently maintained that these practices violate EU principles: \u201cCommunity law allows a citizen resident in one Member State... to use his or her car for personal reasons in another Member State without being obliged to register... provided certain conditions are met\u201d [Kov\u00e1cs, Speaker 3]. He emphasized infringement proceedings had been launched due to \u201clack of proportionality expressed by the confiscation of cars and the very high fines\u201d [Kov\u00e1cs, Speaker 11].\n\n2. **Free Movement and Citizen Rights**\n   - Several contributors underlined that confiscations impede free movement of individuals and goods\u2014basic EU freedoms. David Hammerstein Mintz decried \u201cthe confiscation of vehicles and imposition of astronomical fines... as a blatant violation of Directive 83/182. This... affects all Europe\u201d [Mintz, Speaker 6].\n   - Alessandro Battilocchio underscored harm to both \u201ceconomic, physical and moral stability of the families\u201d affected and called the actions \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d [Battilocchio, Speaker 7].\n\n3. **Adequacy and Timeliness of Greek Legal Reforms**\n   - Greek representatives\u2014Marie Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou and Maria Matsouka\u2014highlighted recent legislative changes in Greece. Matsouka noted that the \u201cGreek law has already been improved... abolishing the penalty of smuggling and the seizure of vehicles, only providing for temporary detention until the imposed fine is paid\u201d and referenced a December 2005 bill set to \u201creduce... and apply temporary detention only in exceptional cases\u201d [Matsouka, Speaker 5].\n   - However, Commission officials and critics argued such reforms, while positive, were insufficient unless fully implemented and communicated: \u201cthe Commission very much welcomes the encouraging signals... and would also welcome this being consolidated by the adoption of the new law\u201d [Kov\u00e1cs, Speaker 8].\n\n4. **Scope and Neutrality of Parliamentary Action**\n   - Marie Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou disputed the legitimacy and relevance of the Parliament\u2019s report: \u201cThe references on which it is based are minimal... The Petitions Committee does not have the right to play the role of judge and to accept as true, without evidence, facts which the courts have yet to decide\u201d [Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou, Speaker 4]. She urged rejection of the report to \u201crestore the authority of the Petitions Committee by respecting the rule of law and non-interference with the work of the judiciary\u201d [Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou, Speaker 4].\n   - Matsouka further argued that Greece was being unfairly singled out: \u201conly Greece is being singled out... which constitutes discriminatory treatment by the European Parliament\u201d [Matsouka, Speaker 5].\n\n5. **Need for Broader EU Reform**\n   - L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs, on behalf of the Commission, linked the issue to broader obstacles in the single market and proposed that \u201cthe Commission has proposed a draft directive on car taxation to remove tax obstacles, recommending the abolition of registration tax and its incorporation into the annual circulation tax over five to ten years\u201d [Kov\u00e1cs, Speaker 3].\n\n---\n\n**Key Proposals and Action Points:**\n\n- **Immediate Legal Alignment:** Multiple speakers called for Greece to swiftly amend national legislation and enforcement practices to align with EU provisions, ensuring penalties are \u201cproportionate and respect the rights of EU citizens\u201d [Kov\u00e1cs, Speaker 3; Cashman, Speaker 2].\n- **Commission Action:** The European Commission has launched infringement proceedings and will maintain judicial oversight until Greece complies or the European Court of Justice intervenes. \u201cThe Commission is ex officio Guardian of the Treaties\u201d [Kov\u00e1cs, Speaker 11].\n- **Compensation for Victims:** Alessandro Battilocchio advocated for \u201cadequate compensation for those unjustly affected\u201d [Battilocchio, Speaker 7].\n- **EU-wide Tax Harmonization:** Kov\u00e1cs recommended legislative reforms for car taxation at the European level to prevent similar issues arising in other Member States [Kov\u00e1cs, Speaker 3].\n- **Parliamentary Oversight:** Critics suggested only to act on substantiated petitions and to avoid duplicating or interfering with judicial processes underway at the national level [Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou, Speaker 4].\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion and Recommendations**\n\nThe debate revealed a broad consensus\u2014excluding Greek national representatives\u2014that Greek authorities\u2019 practices of automobile confiscation and the imposition of excessive fines conflicted with the letter and spirit of EU law, notably concerning proportionality and citizen rights. While Greek authorities have initiated reforms, the European Parliament and Commission emphasized the need for full compliance and timely implementation.\n\n**The following actions are recommended:**\n1. **Greece should urgently complete legislative changes and ensure enforcement in full compliance with EU directives.**\n2. **Greek authorities should reconsider penalty structures to ensure proportionality and due process, and provide clear information to citizens from other Member States about their rights.**\n3. **The European Parliament and Commission should monitor the situation and provide guidance and, if needed, pursue further legal action.**\n4. **Consideration should be given to compensating individuals who suffered economic or moral loss due to retroactively unlawful vehicle confiscation and fines.**\n5. **Broader legislative initiatives should be expedited to harmonize car taxation and vehicle regulations across the EU, mitigating similar disputes in the future.**\n\nThese steps are vital for restoring public trust, upholding EU law and citizens\u2019 rights, and ensuring equitable treatment for all Member States and their citizens.\n\n---", "src_model": "gpt", "model_type": "gpt", "model_name": "gpt-4.1", "structured": true, "incremental": false, "hierarchical": false, "grouped": false, "shuffle": false, "prompt": false, "lang": "original"}
