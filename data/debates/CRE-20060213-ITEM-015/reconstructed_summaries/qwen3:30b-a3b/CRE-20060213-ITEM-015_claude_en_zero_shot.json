The summary has several sections, including the executive summary, key issues and positions, key arguments, and outcomes. \n\nLooking at the \"Key Issues and Positions\" section, there's a part about Michael Cashman (PSE), the rapporteur. He presented the case against Greek practices. The summary says he argued that Greece violated EU law by imposing disproportionate penalties on EU citizens who met legal requirements for tax exemptions. He mentions that petitioners were asked to pay up to ten times the customs duties without considering the vehicle's actual value, and some faced fines up to EUR 45,000 to retrieve their property. Also, he stressed that the acquis communautaire requires proper implementation of EU laws.\n\nI need to make sure I only include what's attributed to Cashman. The user specified not to include arguments from other speakers. So even though there are other points in the summary, like from Kov\u00e1cs or Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou, I should ignore those. \n\nThe key points from Cashman are: \n1. Greece violated EU Directive 83/182/EEC by imposing disproportionate penalties.\n2. Petitioners faced excessive fines (up to 10x duties) and high retrieval costs (EUR 45k).\n3. Emphasis on proper implementation of EU law (acquis communautaire).\n\nI should structure these points clearly, using the exact quotes if possible, but the user might just want the main arguments. The user also mentioned that if there are no points, return an empty string, but in this case, there are several points. \n\nI need to check if there are any other mentions of Cashman in other sections. The \"Outcomes and Proposals\" section mentions Cashman concluding that the problem lies with Greece's authorities. But the user's instruction is to outline the main points or arguments made by the speaker. So that conclusion is part of his argument. \n\nSo the main points are the violation of the directive, the excessive penalties, and the need for proper implementation. Also, the specific examples of fines and the emphasis on proportionality. \n\nI should present these in a clear, concise list without any markdown. Make sure each point is a separate argument made by Cashman, and nothing else.\n</think>\n\nMichael Cashman (PSE) argued that Greece violated EU Directive 83/182/EEC by imposing disproportionate penalties on EU citizens who met legal requirements for tax exemptions on temporary vehicle imports. He highlighted that petitioners were charged up to ten times the standard customs duties without consideration of the vehicle's actual value and faced fines of up to EUR 45,000 to retrieve their vehicles. Cashman emphasized that EU member states must fully implement the acquis communautaire, stating that Greece's practices undermined the principle of free movement for EU citizens.

Mr President, I am pleased to contribute to this debate on the confiscation of cars in Greece. I have read, and now I have heard, Mr Cashman\u2019s report with great interest, and I share all the concerns expressed in it. The issues highlighted in the report are of great importance not only for this specific case but also as regards their impact on the Commission initiatives in the field of car taxation and the fundamental rights of citizens.\nLet me say a few words on the case in question. In addition to the numerous petitions received by Parliament, the Commission has received a great number of complaints over recent years about an administrative practice which leads to the confiscation of cars. I do not intend to go deeply into technical details, but, as you know, Community law allows a citizen resident in one Member State \u2013 I emphasise \u2018resident\u2019 and not \u2018national\u2019 \u2013 to use his or her car for personal reasons in another Member State without being obliged to register his or her car in that other Member State, provided certain conditions are met. One of these conditions is that the use in the other Member State does not exceed six months in one year.\nThe application of this directive has been quite problematic in Greece. It has led to an administrative practice which, unfortunately, has disregarded the fact that, in many cases, the normal residence of Greek citizens is in a state other than Greece. This practice penalises mostly Greek nationals who do not live and work in Greece on a permanent basis. The outcome has been, as you can see from the report, the imposition of very high fines resulting in the confiscation of the vehicles concerned, followed sometimes by their sale at auction, even before a national judge could come to a decision on the case. The Commission has also been informed in the past that, in some cases, this has led to prison sentences. For these reasons, the Commission has launched an infringement procedure and brought the case before the European Court of Justice.\nLet me stress that it is neither the intention nor to the benefit of the Commission to single out one Member State instead of another, since in one way or another every Member State faces its own difficulties in the path towards the realisation of a real internal market, where fundamental freedoms and the respect of Community law should be guaranteed.\nTo a large extent, car taxation is not yet harmonised at Community level. Nevertheless, the freedom that Member States enjoy has to be exercised within the framework laid down by the directives applicable in this field and within the general principles of Community law, which represent the fundamentals of the construction of the European Union.\nWhen an individual incurs significant adverse economic consequences if he or she seeks to make use of his of her car for a certain period of time in another Member State, especially when this is allowed by Community law, this represents a risk to the free movement of citizens within the Union.\nIt is also true that Member States are free to determine the fines that they feel are adequate for an infringement of their laws, assuming that an infringement really occurs. However, they should respect the principle of proportionality. A practice which also disregards the evidence that residence is maintained in a Member State or which imposes high fines without taking into account the good faith of the offender should also be rectified.\nThe Commission, at this stage, has taken all the necessary steps allowed by the Treaty in order to tackle this situation. However, the Commission welcomes an initiative like this, which allows a further reflection on the impact that vehicle taxation has on the life of EU citizens.\nTo conclude, let me say that, looking at the broader perspective, the Commission is not only proceeding with its infringement policy but is also taking a proactive approach in the field of legislative proposals. In July 2005, the Commission adopted my proposal on a draft directive on car taxation, which is intended to remove existing tax obstacles to the transfer of passenger cars from one Member State to another and thus improve the functioning of the internal market. One of the objectives of the proposal is the abolition of the registration tax in order to incorporate it into the annual circulation tax over a period of five to ten years.

Mr President, I am pleased to contribute to this debate on the confiscation of cars in Greece. I have read, and now I have heard, Mr Cashman\u2019s report with great interest, and I share all the concerns expressed in it. The issues highlighted in the report are of great importance not only for this specific case but also as regards their impact on the Commission initiatives in the field of car taxation and the fundamental rights of citizens.\nLet me say a few words on the case in question. In addition to the numerous petitions received by Parliament, the Commission has received a great number of complaints over recent years about an administrative practice which leads to the confiscation of cars. I do not intend to go deeply into technical details, but, as you know, Community law allows a citizen resident in one Member State \u2013 I emphasise \u2018resident\u2019 and not \u2018national\u2019 \u2013 to use his or her car for personal reasons in another Member State without being obliged to register his or her car in that other Member State, provided certain conditions are met. One of these conditions is that the use in the other Member State does not exceed six months in one year.\nThe application of this directive has been quite problematic in Greece. It has led to an administrative practice which, unfortunately, has disregarded the fact that, in many cases, the normal residence of Greek citizens is in a state other than Greece. This practice penalises mostly Greek nationals who do not live and work in Greece on a permanent basis. The outcome has been, as you can see from the report, the imposition of very high fines resulting in the confiscation of the vehicles concerned, followed sometimes by their sale at auction, even before a national judge could come to a decision on the case. The Commission has also been informed in the past that, in some cases, this has led to prison sentences. For these reasons, the Commission has launched an infringement procedure and brought the case before the European Court of Justice.\nLet me stress that it is neither the intention nor to the benefit of the Commission to single out one Member State instead of another, since in one way or another every Member State faces its own difficulties in the path towards the realisation of a real internal market, where fundamental freedoms and the respect of Community law should be guaranteed.\nTo a large extent, car taxation is not yet harmonised at Community level. Nevertheless, the freedom that Member States enjoy has to be exercised within the framework laid down by the directives applicable in this field and within the general principles of Community law, which represent the fundamentals of the construction of the European Union.\nWhen an individual incurs significant adverse economic consequences if he or she seeks to make use of his of her car for a certain period of time in another Member State, especially when this is allowed by Community law, this represents a risk to the free movement of citizens within the Union.\nIt is also true that Member States are free to determine the fines that they feel are adequate for an infringement of their laws, assuming that an infringement really occurs. However, they should respect the principle of proportionality. A practice which also disregards the evidence that residence is maintained in a Member State or which imposes high fines without taking into account the good faith of the offender should also be rectified.\nThe Commission, at this stage, has taken all the necessary steps allowed by the Treaty in order to tackle this situation. However, the Commission welcomes an initiative like this, which allows a further reflection on the impact that vehicle taxation has on the life of EU citizens.\nTo conclude, let me say that, looking at the broader perspective, the Commission is not only proceeding with its infringement policy but is also taking a proactive approach in the field of legislative proposals. In July 2005, the Commission adopted my proposal on a draft directive on car taxation, which is intended to remove existing tax obstacles to the transfer of passenger cars from one Member State to another and thus improve the functioning of the internal market. One of the objectives of the proposal is the abolition of the registration tax in order to incorporate it into the annual circulation tax over a period of five to ten years. The proposal is currently being discussed in various parliamentary committees and in the Council, and I call for your support on this matter.\nI thank you for your attention and look forward to the debate.", "reconstructed_position": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out the main points that L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs made in the debate. Let me look through the summary again.\n\nThe user provided a detailed debate summary, and the speaker in question is L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs, the European Commissioner. The task is to outline the main points or arguments made by him, excluding other speakers' contributions.\n\nLooking at the summary, under the \"Key Issues and Positions\" section, there's a part about L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs. The key points mentioned are:\n\n1. He strongly supported the report's findings.\n2. He mentioned that the Commission had launched an infringement procedure and brought the case to the European Court of Justice.\n3. He acknowledged some progress but noted that further steps are needed to align national practice with Community law.\n4. He emphasized that significant adverse economic consequences for individuals using their cars in another Member State under Community law risks the free movement of citizens.\n\nI need to make sure these are the only points attributed to him. The summary also mentions other speakers, but the user wants only Kov\u00e1cs's arguments. The response should be a list of his main points without any other contributions. Also, if there are no points, return an empty string, but in this case, there are several points. I should present them clearly and concisely, using the exact quotes or paraphrased as needed, but sticking to his statements.\n</think>\n\nL\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs, European Commissioner, supported the report's findings, stating that the Commission had \"launched an infringement procedure and brought the case before the European Court of Justice\" [Kov\u00e1cs, 2006-02-13]. He acknowledged progress but noted that \"further steps still have to be taken to align national practice with Community law\" [Kov\u00e1cs, 2006-02-13]. Kov\u00e1cs emphasized that \"when an individual incurs significant adverse economic consequences if he or she seeks to make use of his or her car for a certain period of time in another Member State, especially when this is allowed by Community law, this represents a risk to the free movement of citizens within the Union\" [Kov\u00e1cs, 2006-02-13]. He also highlighted that Greece had made improvements, stating that \"until a few years ago the fines imposed were those applying to infringement of the customs legislation and also that smuggling was one of the crimes envisaged by the national law. This, fortunately, is no longer the case\" [Kov\u00e1cs, 2006-02-13].", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Marie Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou,", "english": "Marie Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . \u2013 (EL) Mr President, Commissioner, the Cashman report was not drafted in order to defend the acquis communautaire . It is based in essence on fewer than a dozen petitions prior to 2004, the authors of which have either reached a compromise with the Greek authorities or are in court and need support.\nI shall refer to three issues: as far as the relationship of the report to the functioning of the Committee on Petitions is concerned, I wish to comment that it is scandalous that, even though one was requested officially, the written opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs of the European Parliament was never given on the extent to which, while proceedings are pending both before the Court of Justice of the European Communities and before the national courts, it is possible for a report to be drafted and to be put to the vote before the European Parliament. Is this not discriminatory treatment of citizens for whose petitions a report was not drafted precisely because proceedings were pending?\nAs to the content, petitions from just one Member State, Greece, were selected, even though there is also confusion about the use of private cars with foreign number plates in the other 24 Member States. That is precisely why the Commission proposed a new proposal for a directive, as you said, and took Greece to the Court of Justice of the European Communities for infringement on the basis of the 1983 directive. As a result, Greek legislation was amended, both by the socialist government of Greece in 2001 and more recently by the New Democracy government in 2005, which is something the report ignores. So why was the report drafted? The few specific petitions which resulted in the drafting of this report are not representative, but their authors give the impression that they have personal relations of goodwill with Parliament. The Committee on Petitions does not have the right to play the role of judge and to construe as true, without proof, information such as the place of normal residence, on which the courts are called to rule.\nThe report started with an assumed number of petitions of 40 and it transpired that there were few petitions, of which some have been closed with a compromise and others are pending before the courts. I call on my honourable friends in all the groups to vote against the report and to give the Committee on Petitions the authority it deserves, with respect for the rule of law and without intervention in the work of justice.\nI trust, Commissioner, that the proposed new 2005 directive will have a favourable and speedy outcome.", "lang": "EL", "original": "\u039c\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03b1

It is based in essence on fewer than a dozen petitions prior to 2004, the authors of which have either reached a compromise with the Greek authorities or are in court and need support.\nI shall refer to three issues: as far as the relationship of the report to the functioning of the Committee on Petitions is concerned, I wish to comment that it is scandalous that, even though one was requested officially, the written opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs of the European Parliament was never given on the extent to which, while proceedings are pending both before the Court of Justice of the European Communities and before the national courts, it is possible for a report to be drafted and to be put to the vote before the European Parliament. Is this not discriminatory treatment of citizens for whose petitions a report was not drafted precisely because proceedings were pending?\nAs to the content, petitions from just one Member State, Greece, were selected, even though there is also confusion about the use of private cars with foreign number plates in the other 24 Member States. That is precisely why the Commission proposed a new proposal for a directive, as you said, and took Greece to the Court of Justice of the European Communities for infringement on the basis of the 1983 directive. As a result, Greek legislation was amended, both by the socialist government of Greece in 2001 and more recently by the New Democracy government in 2005, which is something the report ignores. So why was the report drafted? The few specific petitions which resulted in the drafting of this report are not representative, but their authors give the impression that they have personal relations of goodwill with Parliament. The Committee on Petitions does not have the right to play the role of judge and to construe as true, without proof, information such as the place of normal residence, on which the courts are called to rule.\nThe report started with an assumed number of petitions of 40 and it transpired that there were few petitions, of which some have been closed with a compromise and others are pending before the courts. I call on my honourable friends in all the groups to vote against the report and to give the Committee on Petitions the authority it deserves, with respect for the rule of law and without intervention in the work of justice.\nI trust, Commissioner, that the proposed new 2005 directive will have a favourable and speedy outcome.", "reconstructed_position": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the main points that Marie Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou made during the debate. Let me start by looking at the provided debate summary.\n\nFrom the summary, under the \"Key Issues and Positions\" section, there's a part about Marie Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou (PPE-DE). The summary says she argued that the report was procedurally flawed. Specifically, she mentioned that \"it is scandalous that, even though one was requested officially, the written opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs of the European Parliament was never given.\" So that's one point: procedural flaws in the report because the Legal Affairs Committee's opinion wasn't included.\n\nAnother part of her argument is that \"the Committee on Petitions does not have the right to play the role of judge and to construe as true, without proof, information such as the place of normal residence.\" So she's challenging the Committee on Petitions' authority, saying they shouldn't act as judges and shouldn't assume information is true without proof. \n\nI need to make sure there are no other points attributed to her. The summary also mentions other speakers like Maria Matsouka, but the user is asking specifically about Marie Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou. The rest of the summary talks about other speakers' arguments, but I should focus only on hers.\n\nSo the two main points are: 1) Procedural flaws in the report due to missing input from the Legal Affairs Committee. 2) The Committee on Petitions overstepping by acting as a judge and assuming facts without proof. \n\nI should check if there's anything else. The summary says she \"mounted a strong defense of their country's position,\" but the specific arguments are the two points mentioned. No other arguments are detailed for her. So the answer should include those two points.\n</think>\n\nMarie Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou argued that the report was procedurally flawed, stating it was \"scandalous\" that the written opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs of the European Parliament was never provided despite an official request. She contended that the Committee on Petitions overstepped its role by acting as a \"judge\" and assuming as true, without proof, information such as the \"place of normal residence\" of individuals.", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Maria Matsouka,", "english": "Maria Matsouka, on behalf of the PSE Group. \u2013 (EL) Mr President, as vice-chairwoman of the Committee on Petitions of the European Parliament and given that we are debating the report by my honourable friend Mr\u00a0Cashman on confiscations of automobiles in Greece, I should point out the following: firstly, a final judgment has not been returned on all the cases before the judicial authorities; consequently there are proceedings pending and, if we assume that we have this jurisdiction, then why has it not also been applied to other similar cases? I would refer by way of example to the example of the petition on dismissals from the SY.EL.AE fertiliser factory, a matter on which the drafting of a report was requested but which was never drafted, however, on the grounds that proceedings were pending.\nSecondly, the report only concerns Greece, at a time when similar petitions have also been filed for other Member States of the European Union. The obvious conclusion from this is that European citizens are subject to discriminatory treatment by the European Parliament itself.\nLet us look now at the report, the petitions and the data: Community directive 83/182 on tax exemptions lays down the preconditions for application of the scheme for the temporary importation and transportation of automobiles for private use. It does not stipulate the fines imposed, for which the Member States are competent. Greek legislation on the fines was adopted in order to suppress fraud in the automobile sector, at a time when it was rife. Besides, the fines do not relate solely to individuals; they also relate to dealers and organised groups that are demonstrably trying to evade taxes.\nWith respect to the non-application of the rule of proportionality, which the report cites for the imposition of fines on the basis solely of the cubic capacity of the vehicle, the court notes that the adoption of such measures is needed for reasons of suppression and prevention. Greek legislation has already been improved with law 2960/2001 abolishing the penalty of smuggling and confiscation of vehicles and making provision solely for temporary seizure pending payment of a fine in order to secure the Greek state. As a result, the courts have handed down acquittals in respect of the criminal element, but not in respect of the fines.\nAs far as the fines are concerned, a bill was tabled before the Greek parliament on 22 December 2005, which makes provision for reductions and for the application of temporary seizure in exceptional cases only. It is, I think, clear that we are all defending the application of the acquis communautaire , while at the same time recognising crucial differences between the Member States.", "lang": "EL",

I would refer by way of example to the example of the petition on dismissals from the SY.EL.AE fertiliser factory, a matter on which the drafting of a report was requested but which was never drafted, however, on the grounds that proceedings were pending.\nSecondly, the report only concerns Greece, at a time when similar petitions have also been filed for other Member States of the European Union. The obvious conclusion from this is that European citizens are subject to discriminatory treatment by the European Parliament itself.\nLet us look now at the report, the petitions and the data: Community directive 83/182 on tax exemptions lays down the preconditions for application of the scheme for the temporary importation and transportation of automobiles for private use. It does not stipulate the fines imposed, for which the Member States are competent. Greek legislation on the fines was adopted in order to suppress fraud in the automobile sector, at a time when it was rife. Besides, the fines do not relate solely to individuals; they also relate to dealers and organised groups that are demonstrably trying to evade taxes.\nWith respect to the non-application of the rule of proportionality, which the report cites for the imposition of fines on the basis solely of the cubic capacity of the vehicle, the court notes that the adoption of such measures is needed for reasons of suppression and prevention. Greek legislation has already been improved with law 2960/2001 abolishing the penalty of smuggling and confiscation of vehicles and making provision solely for temporary seizure pending payment of a fine in order to secure the Greek state. As a result, the courts have handed down acquittals in respect of the criminal element, but not in respect of the fines.\nAs far as the fines are concerned, a bill was tabled before the Greek parliament on 22 December 2005, which makes provision for reductions and for the application of temporary seizure in exceptional cases only. It is, I think, clear that we are all defending the application of the acquis communautaire , while at the same time recognising crucial differences between the Member States.", "reconstructed_position": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what Maria Matsouka's main arguments were in the debate about the confiscation of automobiles by Greek authorities.

The summary says she defended Greece's measures as necessary anti-fraud tools. She mentioned that Greek legislation on fines was adopted to suppress fraud in the automobile sector when it was rife. Also, she argued that European citizens are subject to discriminatory treatment by the European Parliament itself because only Greek cases were examined.\n\nSo, the user is asking for the main points or arguments made by Maria Matsouka. The key points here are her defense of Greece's actions as anti-fraud measures and her claim of discrimination by the EP focusing only on Greece.

For example, other speakers like Cashman or Kov\u00e1cs had different points, but the user wants only Matsouka's arguments. \n\nI should check if there's anything else attributed to her. The summary also mentions she said \"European citizens are subject to discriminatory treatment by the European Parliament itself\" because only Greek cases were examined. That's another point. So her arguments are: 1) Greece's measures are necessary to combat fraud, and 2) the EP is being discriminatory by only looking at Greece's cases. \n\nI need to present these as her main points without adding anything else. The user wants an outline of her arguments, so I'll list them clearly.\n</think>\n\nMaria Matsouka argued that Greece's measures regarding automobile confiscation and fines were necessary anti-fraud tools, stating that Greek legislation was adopted to address widespread fraud in the automobile sector.

I am genuinely shocked by the seriousness of the case.\nLike Mr\u00a0Cashman, whom I thank for his excellent and balanced work, I actually find it unacceptable that this has happened in a European Union that is aiming to complete the single market precisely in the next few days and months, by means of the free movement of goods, persons and economic services.\nIt is unacceptable that European citizens in possession of valid documents, who temporarily find themselves in a Member State as tourists or workers, should be treated like criminals and accused of crimes for which there is not even any evidence.\nThe petitioners have found themselves stripped of their rightful belongings and inflicted fines of many hundreds of thousands of euros. In some cases, these fines have dealt an extremely serious blow to the financial, physical and emotional stability of the families affected.\nThrough this institution, I therefore call for greater compliance with Community law and with its general principles of freedom and proportionality, through strict monitoring of customs procedures.

Let me look through the summary provided.\n\nFirst, the user mentioned that the debate was about the confiscation of automobiles by Greek authorities and EU citizens' rights. The key speakers included Michael Cashman, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs, Marie Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou, Maria Matsouka, and others. The user is specifically asking about Alessandro Battilocchio, who is listed as part of the NI group (Non-Inscribed, I think that's the Italian term for non-attached members).\n\nLooking at the \"Key Arguments\" section, under \"Supporting voices,\" there's a mention of Alessandro Battilocchio (NI). The summary says he emphasized that it's unacceptable for EU citizens with valid documents to be treated like criminals without evidence. His exact quote is: \"It is unacceptable that European citizens in possession of valid documents, who temporarily find themselves in a Member State as tourists or workers, should be treated like criminals and accused of crimes for which there is not even any evidence.\"\n\nSo, the main points from Battilocchio are about the unfair treatment of EU citizens who have valid documents. He's arguing against the harsh measures taken by Greek authorities, pointing out that these citizens aren't criminals and there's no evidence against them. He's highlighting the discrepancy between their legal status and the punitive actions taken. \n\nI need to make sure I don't include other speakers' points. The user specified that only the arguments from the named speaker should be included. So, focusing solely on Battilocchio's contribution. The summary mentions he's part of the NI group, but that's just his political affiliation. The key argument is about the treatment of EU citizens with valid documents being treated as criminals without evidence. \n\nI should structure the answer to reflect that. Maybe start with the main point about the unacceptable treatment, then mention the lack of evidence and the comparison to criminals. Also, note that he's part of the NI group. But the user might not need the group information unless specified. The example response the user gave earlier included the speaker's name and the points. So, the answer should list the arguments made by Battilocchio, which in this case is one main point about the unfair treatment and lack of evidence.\n</think>\n\nAlessandro Battilocchio (NI) argued that it is unacceptable for European citizens in possession of valid documents, who temporarily reside in a Member State as tourists or workers, to be treated like criminals and accused of crimes without any evidence.

Mr President, I have listened to the debate attentively and I wish to comment on a few aspects.\nIt is true that since the beginning of the infringement procedure, the situation has improved in the Member State concerned. I would like to recall that until a few years ago the fines imposed were those applying to infringement of the customs legislation and also that smuggling was one of the crimes envisaged by the national law. This, fortunately, is no longer the case and the Commission wants to express its satisfaction at the progress made. However, further steps still have to be taken to align national practice with Community law.\nLet me clarify one important point: the high registration taxes on vehicles that are applied in some Member States on the occasion of a permanent transfer of residence are a completely different issue from the one dealt with in Mr Cashman\u2019s report.\nOn the one hand, the determination of the amount of registration tax due when a person registers a car in one state depends on the tax policy of the Member State concerned. European law \u2013 particularly the prohibition of discrimination against imported goods in favour of domestic goods \u2013 may have a bearing with respect to how the tax is calculated, especially with respect to the value attributed to second-hand cars. However, Community law does not prevent a Member State from applying a high registration tax on vehicles.\nOn the other hand, Mr Cashman\u2019s report deals with the application of an existing directive, which allows a temporary use of a vehicle in another Member State without the obligation to re-register it. I would add that this is an issue of concrete application of Community law by national authorities. The report concerns, inter alia, the interpretation of the concept of \u2018normal residence\u2019 by the national authorities, which runs counter to the principles enshrined in the directive itself.\nIn fact, the directive is able to function properly only if a person who resides in one Member State is allowed to use his vehicle in the territory of a Member State other than that where the normal residence is located. If evidence of residence in the first state is not accepted or is rendered difficult by the second state, the directive has no chance of being applied correctly. I would also remind you that the issue concerns the freedom to provide and receive services in another Member State. This is the core point of the case being discussed now.\nBefore concluding, I wish to react to some of the issues and questions raised by some of the participants in the debate. It is true that other Member States are also infringing Community law, but these infringements are in connection with other aspects of car taxation, such as discrimination in levying registration tax, and there has been no confiscation of cars, which also points to the lack of proportionality.\nAnother issue raised during the debate was whether it was legal or legitimate that actions are being taken when the European Court of Justice is still discussing the case. We sought the opinion of Parliament\u2019s Legal Service. It had no objections, and the Commission is certainly not in a position to review the view of Parliament\u2019s Legal Service.\nTo conclude, I want to say that in this case, bearing in mind that the Commission is still receiving complaints on this issue, the Commission has taken all the action possible.

Of course this pending case does not in any way prevent a Member State that wishes to comply with Community Law from changing its legislation in the meantime before the decision is issued.

Whether the case is before the Court or not, given that we are co-legislator it would be staggering if the European Parliament did not have an opinion on whether a Member State is compliant.\nFinally, the resolution of this problem quite clearly lies with the Greek authorities. They can resolve it swiftly or they can leave it to the European Court of Justice.", "reconstructed_position": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to outline the main points or arguments made by Michael Cashman (PSE) in the debate summary provided. First, I need to go through the debate summary and pick out all the parts where Cashman is mentioned.\n\nLooking at the Executive Summary section, under \"Key Issues and Positions,\" there's a part about Michael Cashman (PSE), the Rapporteur. He presented the case against Greek practices. The summary mentions he argued that Greece violated EU law by imposing disproportionate penalties on EU citizens who met the legal requirements for tax exemptions. Specifically, he points out that petitioners were asked to pay up to ten times the customs duties without considering the vehicle's actual value, and some faced fines up to EUR 45,000 to retrieve their property. He also stressed that the acquis communautaire requires proper implementation of EU directives.\n\nI need to make sure I only include what's attributed to Cashman. The summary also mentions he said, \"the acquis communautaire and being a member of the EU means that we adopt fully and transpose properly the acquis.\" Then, in the \"Outcomes and Proposals\" section, Cashman concludes that the resolution lies with the Greek authorities, either swiftly or through the European Court of Justice.\n\nI should check if there are any other mentions of Cashman. The rest of the summary talks about other speakers like Kov\u00e1cs, Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou, Matsouka, Hammerstein Mintz, and Battilocchio, but those are other contributors. The user specified to only include arguments from the named speaker, which is Michael Cashman.\n\nSo the main points from Cashman are:\n1. Greece violated EU Directive 83/182/EEC by imposing disproportionate penalties.\n2. Petitioners faced excessive fines (up to 10x duties) and confiscations (up to \u20ac45k).\n3. Emphasis on proper implementation of EU law (acquis communautaire).\n4. Concluded that Greece needs to resolve the issue either voluntarily or through the ECJ.\n\nI need to present these points clearly, without including other speakers' arguments. Also, ensure that each point is directly from Cashman's contributions as per the summary. The user wants an outline, so bullet points or numbered list would be appropriate. But since the user says \"outline the main points or arguments,\" maybe a concise list without markdown. But the example response uses bullet points, so perhaps that's acceptable.\n\nDouble-check that there's no mention of other speakers' points. The user also mentioned if there are no points, respond with an empty string, but in this case, there are several points from Cashman.\n</think>\n\n- Argued that Greece violated EU law by imposing disproportionate penalties on EU citizens who met legal requirements for tax exemptions on temporary vehicle imports.  \n- Highlighted that petitioners faced fines up to ten times the level of customs duties and confiscations requiring payments of up to EUR 45,000 to retrieve their vehicles.  \n- Emphasized that EU membership requires proper implementation of the acquis communautaire, stating, \"the acquis communautaire and being a member of the EU means that we adopt fully and transpose properly the acquis.\"  \n- Concluded that resolving the issue depended on Greek authorities either addressing the problem swiftly or leaving it to the European Court of Justice.", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Marie Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou (PPE-DE).", "english": "Marie Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou (PPE-DE). \u2013 (EL) Mr President, I wanted to ask if we will have a second chance to speak, as you gave the floor to Mr Cashman.
