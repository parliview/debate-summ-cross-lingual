Let me start by reading through the provided debate summary carefully.\n\nThe summary mentions that there were 11 speakers, and the main topic was about the confiscation of automobiles by Greek authorities and violations of an EU directive. The key speakers mentioned are Michael Cashman (the rapporteur), Commissioner L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs, Marie Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou, Maria Matsouka, David Hammerstein Mintz, and Alessandro Battilocchio. The user is asking about the President's contributions. \n\nLooking through the entire summary, I need to check if the President is mentioned as one of the speakers. The summary lists the speakers in the \"Key Issues and Positions\" section. Let me scan through each part. \n\nThe first part under \"Key Issues and Positions\" starts with Michael Cashman, then Commissioner Kov\u00e1cs, then Greek MEPs like Marie Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou and Maria Matsouka. Then David Hammerstein Mintz and Alessandro Battilocchio. The rest of the summary talks about the arguments and proposals, but I don't see any mention of the President speaking. \n\nThe user's instruction says that if there are no points attributed to the speaker, I should respond with an empty string. Since the summary doesn't mention the President making any contributions, the answer should be empty. \n\nWait, but sometimes in parliamentary debates, the President might make opening or closing remarks. However, the summary provided doesn't mention the President's statements. The debate information section mentions the date, number of contributions, and topic, but not the President's role. The executive summary and key issues sections don't attribute any statements to the President. \n\nTherefore, based on the given information, there's no mention of the President's arguments or contributions.

One could say that we are dealing with a Greek tragedy, but one that affects other EU citizens. On the Committee on Petitions, above all other committees, I believe we have to put aside our national and party political obligations and allegiances in order to deliver natural justice for the citizens who approach us.\nWe have received numerous petitions from citizens across the EU concerning confiscation of their cars by the Greek authorities. The petitioners have stated that Greece has not properly implemented Directive 83/182/EEC, which concerns conditions for the exemption of certain taxes and excise duties for EU citizens who are normally resident \u2013 and that is key \u2013 in another Member State. The Greek authorities have also imposed disproportionately high administrative penalties and confiscated petitioners\u2019 property, claiming that those concerned were attempting to evade tax payments. The petitioners have been asked, in some instances, to pay up to ten times the level of customs duties without any due recognition of the actual value of the motor vehicle.\nThis report has been discussed several times in committee and was adopted by a large majority at the end of November. The petitioners came to present their petition, explaining that, in some cases, they have had to pay fees and fines of up to EUR\u00a045\u00a0000 to retrieve their property, after the Greek authorities had impounded and confiscated their vehicles. Both I, as rapporteur, and the chairman of the Committee on Petitions have been in regular contact with the Greek authorities to try and resolve these issues and the cases that are currently before them.\nAn amendment to the law on the Greek national customs code has been adopted by the Greek Parliament.

The summary mentions that he presented the core case against Greece. He argued that Greek authorities violated the EU directive by confiscating vehicles from EU citizens who met tax exemption requirements. He cited examples of people being asked to pay up to ten times the customs duties without considering the vehicle's actual value, and fines up to EUR 45,000 to retrieve their property. He emphasized that EU membership requires proper implementation of the acquis, and he called for the Commission to take action if Greece doesn't comply.\n\nI need to make sure I only include his arguments and not others.

He highlighted that petitioners were often required to pay up to ten times the customs duties without due consideration of the vehicle's actual value, and faced fines of up to EUR 45,000 to retrieve their property. Cashman stressed that EU membership necessitates proper implementation of the acquis communautaire, stating that Greece's practices undermined the free movement of citizens and required the Commission to take action if compliance was not achieved. He concluded that Greece's non-compliance with the directive was clear and that resolving the issue rested with Greek authorities, either through swift legislative changes or referral to the European Court of Justice.", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs,", "english": "L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs, Member of the Commission . Mr President, I am pleased to contribute to this debate on the confiscation of cars in Greece. I have read, and now I have heard, Mr Cashman\u2019s report with great interest, and I share all the concerns expressed in it. The issues highlighted in the report are of great importance not only for this specific case but also as regards their impact on the Commission initiatives in the field of car taxation and the fundamental rights of citizens.\nLet me say a few words on the case in question. In addition to the numerous petitions received by Parliament, the Commission has received a great number of complaints over recent years about an administrative practice which leads to the confiscation of cars. I do not intend to go deeply into technical details, but, as you know, Community law allows a citizen resident in one Member State \u2013 I emphasise \u2018resident\u2019 and not \u2018national\u2019 \u2013 to use his or her car for personal reasons in another Member State without being obliged to register his or her car in that other Member State, provided certain conditions are met. One of these conditions is that the use in the other Member State does not exceed six months in one year.\nThe application of this directive has been quite problematic in Greece. It has led to an administrative practice which, unfortunately, has disregarded the fact that, in many cases, the normal residence of Greek citizens is in a state other than Greece. This practice penalises mostly Greek nationals who do not live and work in Greece on a permanent basis. The outcome has been, as you can see from the report, the imposition of very high fines resulting in the confiscation of the vehicles concerned, followed sometimes by their sale at auction, even before a national judge could come to a decision on the case. The Commission has also been informed in the past that, in some cases, this has led to prison sentences. For these reasons, the Commission has launched an infringement procedure and brought the case before the European Court of Justice.\nLet me stress that it is neither the intention nor to the benefit of the Commission to single out one Member State instead of another, since in one way or another every Member State faces its own difficulties in the path towards the realisation of a real internal market, where fundamental freedoms and the respect of Community law should be guaranteed.\nTo a large extent, car taxation is not yet harmonised at Community level. Nevertheless, the freedom that Member States enjoy has to be exercised within the framework laid down by the directives applicable in this field and within the general principles of Community law, which represent the fundamentals of the construction of the European Union.\nWhen an individual incurs significant adverse economic consequences if he or she seeks to make use of his of her car for a certain period of time in another Member State, especially when this is allowed by Community law, this represents a risk to the free movement of citizens within the Union.\nIt is also true that Member States are free to determine the fines that they feel are adequate for an infringement of their laws, assuming that an infringement really occurs. However, they should respect the principle of proportionality. A practice which also disregards the evidence that residence is maintained in a Member State or which imposes high fines without taking into account the good faith of the offender should also be rectified.\nThe Commission, at this stage, has taken all the necessary steps allowed by the Treaty in order to tackle this situation. However, the Commission welcomes an initiative like this, which allows a further reflection on the impact that vehicle taxation has on the life of EU citizens.\nTo conclude, let me say that, looking at the broader perspective, the Commission is not only proceeding with its infringement policy but is also taking a proactive approach in the field of legislative proposals. In July 2005, the Commission adopted my proposal on a draft directive on car taxation, which is intended to remove existing tax obstacles to the transfer of passenger cars from one Member State to another and thus improve the functioning of the internal market. One of the objectives of the proposal is the abolition of the registration tax in order to incorporate it into the annual circulation tax over a period of five to ten years. The proposal is currently being discussed in various parliamentary committees and in the Council, and I call for your support on this matter.\nI thank you for your attention and look forward to the debate.", "lang": "EN", "original": "L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs, Member of the Commission .

Mr President, I am pleased to contribute to this debate on the confiscation of cars in Greece. I have read, and now I have heard, Mr Cashman\u2019s report with great interest, and I share all the concerns expressed in it. The issues highlighted in the report are of great importance not only for this specific case but also as regards their impact on the Commission initiatives in the field of car taxation and the fundamental rights of citizens.\nLet me say a few words on the case in question. In addition to the numerous petitions received by Parliament, the Commission has received a great number of complaints over recent years about an administrative practice which leads to the confiscation of cars. I do not intend to go deeply into technical details, but, as you know, Community law allows a citizen resident in one Member State \u2013 I emphasise \u2018resident\u2019 and not \u2018national\u2019 \u2013 to use his or her car for personal reasons in another Member State without being obliged to register his or her car in that other Member State, provided certain conditions are met. One of these conditions is that the use in the other Member State does not exceed six months in one year.\nThe application of this directive has been quite problematic in Greece. It has led to an administrative practice which, unfortunately, has disregarded the fact that, in many cases, the normal residence of Greek citizens is in a state other than Greece. This practice penalises mostly Greek nationals who do not live and work in Greece on a permanent basis. The outcome has been, as you can see from the report, the imposition of very high fines resulting in the confiscation of the vehicles concerned, followed sometimes by their sale at auction, even before a national judge could come to a decision on the case. The Commission has also been informed in the past that, in some cases, this has led to prison sentences. For these reasons, the Commission has launched an infringement procedure and brought the case before the European Court of Justice.\nLet me stress that it is neither the intention nor to the benefit of the Commission to single out one Member State instead of another, since in one way or another every Member State faces its own difficulties in the path towards the realisation of a real internal market, where fundamental freedoms and the respect of Community law should be guaranteed.\nTo a large extent, car taxation is not yet harmonised at Community level. Nevertheless, the freedom that Member States enjoy has to be exercised within the framework laid down by the directives applicable in this field and within the general principles of Community law, which represent the fundamentals of the construction of the European Union.\nWhen an individual incurs significant adverse economic consequences if he or she seeks to make use of his of her car for a certain period of time in another Member State, especially when this is allowed by Community law, this represents a risk to the free movement of citizens within the Union.\nIt is also true that Member States are free to determine the fines that they feel are adequate for an infringement of their laws, assuming that an infringement really occurs. However, they should respect the principle of proportionality. A practice which also disregards the evidence that residence is maintained in a Member State or which imposes high fines without taking into account the good faith of the offender should also be rectified.\nThe Commission, at this stage, has taken all the necessary steps allowed by the Treaty in order to tackle this situation. However, the Commission welcomes an initiative like this, which allows a further reflection on the impact that vehicle taxation has on the life of EU citizens.\nTo conclude, let me say that, looking at the broader perspective, the Commission is not only proceeding with its infringement policy but is also taking a proactive approach in the field of legislative proposals. In July 2005, the Commission adopted my proposal on a draft directive on car taxation, which is intended to remove existing tax obstacles to the transfer of passenger cars from one Member State to another and thus improve the functioning of the internal market. One of the objectives of the proposal is the abolition of the registration tax in order to incorporate it into the annual circulation tax over a period of five to ten years. The proposal is currently being discussed in various parliamentary committees and in the Council, and I call for your support on this matter.\nI thank you for your attention and look forward to the debate.", "reconstructed_position": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs said in the debate. Let me look through the summary again.\n\nThe user provided a detailed debate summary, and the task is to outline the main points made by L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs. The key here is to only include his arguments, not others. \n\nLooking at the Executive Summary section, there's a part about Commissioner L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs. The summary says he strongly supported the report, mentioned that the Commission had launched infringement procedures and took the case to the European Court of Justice. He also talked about how the issue penalizes Greek nationals not living in Greece, leading to prison sentences. He emphasized that when individuals face significant economic consequences for using their cars in another Member State, it's a risk to free movement. He acknowledged some Greek improvements but said more steps are needed. \n\nI need to make sure I don't include anything from other speakers. The user specified that contributions from others shouldn't be included. So, the answer should only have Kov\u00e1cs's points. \n\nLet me check if there's anything else attributed to him. The summary mentions he clarified that other Member States have car taxation issues but no confiscation. Also, he welcomed encouraging signals from Greece but stressed legislative changes are needed. \n\nWait, the user's example response for another speaker included specific quotes. So I should structure the points based on his statements. The main points are: supporting the report, infringement procedures and ECJ, penalizing Greeks not in the country, prison sentences, free movement concerns, acknowledging Greek improvements, need for more steps, and the difference in other countries' issues. \n\nI need to present these as concise points without quoting directly, but the example seems to use direct quotes. Wait, the user's instruction says \"outline the main points or arguments made by that speaker.\" So maybe paraphrase, but the example includes quotes. Let me check the example given by the user. \n\nIn the example, the assistant wrote: \"Kov\u00e1cs supported the report, stating that the Commission had launched infringement procedures and brought the case before the European Court of Justice. He highlighted that the issue 'penalises mostly Greek nationals who do not live and work in Greece on a permanent basis' and noted that 'in some cases, this has led to prison sentences.' Kov\u00e1cs argued that excessive economic consequences for using a car in another Member State risk the free movement of citizens within the Union. He acknowledged some Greek improvements but stressed that 'further steps still have to be taken to align national practice with Community law.' He also noted that while other Member States have car taxation issues, 'there has been no confiscation of cars' elsewhere, emphasizing the unique severity of Greece's approach. Kov\u00e1cs welcomed 'encouraging signals' from Greek authorities but stressed that official legislative changes were still needed.\"\n\nSo the assistant included direct quotes from Kov\u00e1cs. Therefore, I should do the same. Let me extract all the quotes attributed to Kov\u00e1cs in the summary.\n\nThe summary says:\n\n- \"Kov\u00e1cs supported the report, confirming that the Commission had launched infringement procedures and brought the case before the European Court of Justice.\"\n- \"He explained that the issue 'penalises mostly Greek nationals who do not live and work in Greece on a permanent basis' and noted that 'in some cases, this has led to prison sentences.'\"\n- \"Kov\u00e1cs argued that 'when an individual incurs significant adverse economic consequences if he or she seeks to make use of his or her car for a certain period of time in another Member State, especially when this is allowed by Community law, this represents a risk to the free movement of citizens within the Union'\"\n- \"He acknowledged some Greek improvements but maintained that 'further steps still have to be taken to align national practice with Community law.'\"\n- \"He clarified that while other Member States had car taxation issues, 'there has been no confiscation of cars' elsewhere, highlighting the unique severity of Greece's approach.\"\n- \"He welcomed 'encouraging signals' from Greek authorities during the debate but stressed that official legislative changes were still needed.\"\n\nSo the main points are:\n\n1. Supported the report and mentioned infringement procedures and ECJ.\n2. Noted that the issue penalizes Greek nationals not living there, leading to prison sentences.\n3. Argued that excessive economic consequences for using a car in another state risk free movement.\n4. Acknowledged Greek improvements but said more steps needed.\n5. Compared to other countries, no confiscation, so Greece's approach is unique.\n6. Welcomed signals from Greece but needed legislative changes.\n\nI need to present these as the main points made by Kov\u00e1cs. Make sure not to include others. The user's example included all these points with quotes. So the answer should be a list of these points, each with the relevant quote.\n</think>\n\nKov\u00e1cs supported the report, confirming that the Commission had launched infringement procedures and brought the case before the European Court of Justice.

It is based in essence on fewer than a dozen petitions prior to 2004, the authors of which have either reached a compromise with the Greek authorities or are in court and need support.\nI shall refer to three issues: as far as the relationship of the report to the functioning of the Committee on Petitions is concerned, I wish to comment that it is scandalous that, even though one was requested officially, the written opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs of the European Parliament was never given on the extent to which, while proceedings are pending both before the Court of Justice of the European Communities and before the national courts, it is possible for a report to be drafted and to be put to the vote before the European Parliament. Is this not discriminatory treatment of citizens for whose petitions a report was not drafted precisely because proceedings were pending?\nAs to the content, petitions from just one Member State, Greece, were selected, even though there is also confusion about the use of private cars with foreign number plates in the other 24 Member States. That is precisely why the Commission proposed a new proposal for a directive, as you said, and took Greece to the Court of Justice of the European Communities for infringement on the basis of the 1983 directive. As a result, Greek legislation was amended, both by the socialist government of Greece in 2001 and more recently by the New Democracy government in 2005, which is something the report ignores. So why was the report drafted? The few specific petitions which resulted in the drafting of this report are not representative, but their authors give the impression that they have personal relations of goodwill with Parliament. The Committee on Petitions does not have the right to play the role of judge and to construe as true, without proof, information such as the place of normal residence, on which the courts are called to rule.\nThe report started with an assumed number of petitions of 40 and it transpired that there were few petitions, of which some have been closed with a compromise and others are pending before the courts. I call on my honourable friends in all the groups to vote against the report and to give the Committee on Petitions the authority it deserves, with respect for the rule of law and without intervention in the work of justice.\nI trust, Commissioner, that the proposed new 2005 directive will have a favourable and speedy outcome.", "lang": "EL", "original": "\u039c\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03b1

the main points that Marie Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou made in the debate. Let me start by looking at the summary provided.\n\nFrom the debate summary, under the \"Key Issues and Positions\" section, there's a part about Marie Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou. The summary says she argued that the report was procedurally flawed and discriminatory. She mentioned that the written opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs wasn't given when the report was drafted, especially since court proceedings were pending. She also said that similar issues exist in other Member States and that Greece had already amended its legislation in 2001 and 2005. She called for voting against the report and giving the Committee on Petitions the authority it deserves, respecting the rule of law and not interfering with justice.\n\nSo, her main points are: \n\n1. The report has procedural flaws, specifically not getting the Committee on Legal Affairs' opinion while court cases were ongoing.\n2. The report is discriminatory because other countries have similar issues but aren't targeted.\n3. Greece has already made legal changes in 2001 and 2005, implying they're addressing the problem.\n4. She wants the Committee on Petitions to have proper authority without interference, emphasizing rule of law and not meddling in judicial processes.\n\nI need to make sure I don't include anything from other speakers. The user specified to only include points attributed to the given speaker. So, I should list these points clearly without adding others. Let me check again to ensure I didn't miss anything. The summary mentions her defending Greece's actions, so these points are accurate. Alright, that should cover her arguments.\n</think>\n\nMarie Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou argued that the report was procedurally flawed, contending that the Committee on Legal Affairs of the European Parliament had not provided a written opinion on the report's drafting while court proceedings were ongoing. She described the report as discriminatory, noting that similar issues exist in other Member States and that Greece had already amended its legislation in 2001 and 2005.

I would refer by way of example to the example of the petition on dismissals from the SY.EL.AE fertiliser factory, a matter on which the drafting of a report was requested but which was never drafted, however, on the grounds that proceedings were pending.\nSecondly, the report only concerns Greece, at a time when similar petitions have also been filed for other Member States of the European Union. The obvious conclusion from this is that European citizens are subject to discriminatory treatment by the European Parliament itself.\nLet us look now at the report, the petitions and the data: Community directive 83/182 on tax exemptions lays down the preconditions for application of the scheme for the temporary importation and transportation of automobiles for private use. It does not stipulate the fines imposed, for which the Member States are competent. Greek legislation on the fines was adopted in order to suppress fraud in the automobile sector, at a time when it was rife. Besides, the fines do not relate solely to individuals; they also relate to dealers and organised groups that are demonstrably trying to evade taxes.\nWith respect to the non-application of the rule of proportionality, which the report cites for the imposition of fines on the basis solely of the cubic capacity of the vehicle, the court notes that the adoption of such measures is needed for reasons of suppression and prevention. Greek legislation has already been improved with law 2960/2001 abolishing the penalty of smuggling and confiscation of vehicles and making provision solely for temporary seizure pending payment of a fine in order to secure the Greek state. As a result, the courts have handed down acquittals in respect of the criminal element, but not in respect of the fines.\nAs far as the fines are concerned, a bill was tabled before the Greek parliament on 22 December 2005, which makes provision for reductions and for the application of temporary seizure in exceptional cases only. It is, I think, clear that we are all defending the application of the acquis communautaire , while at the same time recognising crucial differences between the Member States.", "lang": "EL",

The user is asking specifically about Maria Matsouka's contributions.\n\nLooking at the section on Greek MEPs, Maria Matsouka is mentioned. The summary says she supported the position of defending Greece. She argued that Greek legislation was adopted to suppress fraud in the automobile sector, which was rampant. She mentioned that penalties targeted not just individuals but also dealers and organized groups trying to evade taxes. Additionally, she claimed that European citizens are subject to discriminatory treatment by the European Parliament itself because of the selective focus on Greece.\n\nSo, her main points are: 1) The Greek laws were necessary to combat fraud. 2) Penalties were aimed at both individuals and organized groups. 3) The EP is being discriminatory by focusing only on Greece when similar issues exist elsewhere.\n\nI need to make sure I don't include anything from other speakers.

Let me start by reading through the provided debate summary carefully.\n\nThe user mentioned that the task is to outline the main points of the specified speaker, in this case, Alessandro Battilocchio. The key is to only include arguments attributed to him and exclude others. \n\nLooking at the summary, there's a section titled \"Key Issues and Positions\" which includes contributions from various speakers. Let me scan through that section for Battilocchio's name. \n\nHere's the relevant part: \"Alessandro Battilocchio reinforced these concerns, having met affected petitioners including Mr. Louloudakis. He found it 'unacceptable that European citizens in possession of valid documents, who temporarily find themselves in a Member State as tourists or workers, should be treated like criminals and accused of crimes for which there is not even any evidence' [Battilocchio, 2006-02-13].\"\n\nSo, Battilocchio's main argument is about the treatment of European citizens with valid documents. He's against treating them as criminals without evidence. The summary also mentions he \"reinforced these concerns,\" which refers to the previous speakers' points about Greece's practices. But the user wants only Battilocchio's points. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other mention of him elsewhere. Let me check the rest of the summary again. The \"Key Arguments and Proposals\" section talks about supporters of the report arguing about proportionality, but that's not specific to Battilocchio. The other speakers like Cashman, Kov\u00e1cs, Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou, Matsouka, Hammerstein Mintz, and others are mentioned, but Battilocchio's contribution is only in the part I already noted.\n\nSo, the main point is his criticism of Greece's treatment of citizens with valid documents, likening them to criminals without evidence. There's no other argument from him in the summary. Therefore, the answer should reflect that single point.\n</think>\n\nAlessandro Battilocchio (NI) argued that European citizens possessing valid documents who temporarily reside in a Member State as tourists or workers should not be treated as criminals.

I would like to recall that until a few years ago the fines imposed were those applying to infringement of the customs legislation and also that smuggling was one of the crimes envisaged by the national law. This, fortunately, is no longer the case and the Commission wants to express its satisfaction at the progress made. However, further steps still have to be taken to align national practice with Community law.\nLet me clarify one important point: the high registration taxes on vehicles that are applied in some Member States on the occasion of a permanent transfer of residence are a completely different issue from the one dealt with in Mr Cashman\u2019s report.\nOn the one hand, the determination of the amount of registration tax due when a person registers a car in one state depends on the tax policy of the Member State concerned. European law \u2013 particularly the prohibition of discrimination against imported goods in favour of domestic goods \u2013 may have a bearing with respect to how the tax is calculated, especially with respect to the value attributed to second-hand cars. However, Community law does not prevent a Member State from applying a high registration tax on vehicles.\nOn the other hand, Mr Cashman\u2019s report deals with the application of an existing directive, which allows a temporary use of a vehicle in another Member State without the obligation to re-register it. I would add that this is an issue of concrete application of Community law by national authorities. The report concerns, inter alia, the interpretation of the concept of \u2018normal residence\u2019 by the national authorities, which runs counter to the principles enshrined in the directive itself.\nIn fact, the directive is able to function properly only if a person who resides in one Member State is allowed to use his vehicle in the territory of a Member State other than that where the normal residence is located. If evidence of residence in the first state is not accepted or is rendered difficult by the second state, the directive has no chance of being applied correctly. I would also remind you that the issue concerns the freedom to provide and receive services in another Member State. This is the core point of the case being discussed now.\nBefore concluding, I wish to react to some of the issues and questions raised by some of the participants in the debate. It is true that other Member States are also infringing Community law, but these infringements are in connection with other aspects of car taxation, such as discrimination in levying registration tax, and there has been no confiscation of cars, which also points to the lack of proportionality.\nAnother issue raised during the debate was whether it was legal or legitimate that actions are being taken when the European Court of Justice is still discussing the case. We sought the opinion of Parliament\u2019s Legal Service. It had no objections, and the Commission is certainly not in a position to review the view of Parliament\u2019s Legal Service.\nTo conclude, I want to say that in this case, bearing in mind that the Commission is still receiving complaints on this issue, the Commission has taken all the action possible.

Let me start by reading through the summary again to make sure I don't miss anything.\n\nThe debate was about Greece's automobile confiscations and violations of EU Directive 83/182/EEC. The speaker in question is Commissioner L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs. From the summary, there's a section titled \"Commissioner L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs\" which includes his statements. \n\nHe supported the report by Michael Cashman, mentioning that the Commission had launched infringement procedures and took the case to the European Court of Justice. He pointed out that the issue affects Greek nationals who don't live and work in Greece permanently, leading to heavy fines and even prison sentences. Kov\u00e1cs argued that when individuals face significant economic consequences for using their cars in another Member State, it risks the free movement of citizens. He acknowledged some improvements in Greece but said more steps were needed to align with EU law.\n\nSo, the key points here are his support for the report, the Commission's actions (infringement procedures and ECJ), the impact on Greek nationals, the issue of free movement, and the call for further compliance. I need to make sure I only include what's attributed to him and not others. The user wants only his arguments, no others. Let me check if there's anything else he said. The summary also mentions he noted that other Member States have car taxation issues but no confiscation, highlighting Greece's unique severity. But wait, that part is in the \"Key Arguments and Proposals\" section, not directly under his name. Wait, looking back, the summary under \"Commissioner L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs\" says: \"He explained that the issue 'penalises mostly Greek nationals...' and noted that 'in some cases, this has led to prison sentences.' He argued that 'when an individual incurs significant adverse economic consequences... this represents a risk to the free movement...' He acknowledged some Greek improvements but maintained that 'further steps still have to be taken...'\"\n\nThen in the \"Key Arguments and Proposals\" section, it says: \"Commissioner Kov\u00e1cs clarified that while other Member States had car taxation issues, 'there has been no confiscation of cars' elsewhere, highlighting the unique severity of Greece's approach. He welcomed 'encouraging signals' from Greek authorities during the debate but stressed that official legislative changes were still needed.\"\n\nSo the points from Kov\u00e1cs are:\n\n1. Supported the report and mentioned Commission's infringement procedures and ECJ action.\n2. Noted that the issue penalizes Greek nationals not living in Greece, leading to fines and prison.\n3. Argued that excessive economic consequences for using cars in another MS risks free movement.\n4. Acknowledged some Greek improvements but needs more steps for compliance.\n5. Clarified that other MS have taxation issues but no confiscation, so Greece's approach is unique.\n6. Welcomed signals from Greece but stressed need for legislative changes.\n\nBut I need to make sure these are all directly from his contributions. The summary under his name includes the first four points. The fifth and sixth are in the \"Key Arguments and Proposals\" section, but the user's instruction is to only include points attributed to the speaker. However, the summary might attribute those statements to him.

He highlighted that Greek practices disproportionately penalized Greek nationals not permanently based in the country, imposing fines of up to EUR 45,000 and even prison sentences. Kov\u00e1cs argued that such measures created \"significant adverse economic consequences\" for EU citizens using their vehicles in other Member States, thereby threatening the principle of free movement. While acknowledging some Greek legislative improvements, he emphasized that further steps were required to align national laws with EU standards. Kov\u00e1cs also noted that other Member States faced car taxation issues but did not engage in vehicle confiscation, underscoring the unique severity of Greece's approach.

Whether the case is before the Court or not, given that we are co-legislator it would be staggering if the European Parliament did not have an opinion on whether a Member State is compliant.\nFinally, the resolution of this problem quite clearly lies with the Greek authorities.

First, I need to make sure I only include his contributions and not others.\n\nLooking at the summary, Michael Cashman is the rapporteur. The key sections about him are in the \"Key Issues and Positions\" part. He presented the core case against Greece, arguing that Greek authorities violated EU Directive 83/182/EEC by confiscating vehicles from EU citizens who met tax exemption requirements. He mentioned that petitioners were asked to pay up to ten times the customs duties without considering the vehicle's actual value, and fines up to EUR 45,000 to retrieve their property. He emphasized that EU membership requires proper implementation of the acquis and called for the Commission to take action if Greece doesn't comply.\n\nI need to extract these points. The user said not to include other speakers' arguments, so I should focus only on Cashman's statements. Let me check if there's anything else attributed to him. The summary also mentions he called for the Commission to act if Greece fails to implement directives. The conclusion part says he reaffirmed Greece's non-compliance and that the resolution lies with Greek authorities.\n\nSo the main points are: systematic violations of the directive, confiscation of vehicles from eligible citizens, excessive fines, failure to recognize vehicle value, call for Commission action, and insistence on Greece's responsibility to comply.\n</think>\n\nMichael Cashman (PSE) argued that Greek authorities systematically violated EU Directive 83/182/EEC by confiscating vehicles from EU citizens who met legal tax exemption criteria.

Cashman stressed that EU membership necessitates proper implementation of Community law, stating that \"the acquis communautaire\" requires full transposition.
