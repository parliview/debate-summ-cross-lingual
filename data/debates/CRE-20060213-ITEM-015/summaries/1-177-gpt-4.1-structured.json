Mr President, I have listened to the debate attentively and I wish to comment on a few aspects.\nIt is true that since the beginning of the infringement procedure, the situation has improved in the Member State concerned. I would like to recall that until a few years ago the fines imposed were those applying to infringement of the customs legislation and also that smuggling was one of the crimes envisaged by the national law. This, fortunately, is no longer the case and the Commission wants to express its satisfaction at the progress made. However, further steps still have to be taken to align national practice with Community law.\nLet me clarify one important point: the high registration taxes on vehicles that are applied in some Member States on the occasion of a permanent transfer of residence are a completely different issue from the one dealt with in Mr Cashman\u2019s report.\nOn the one hand, the determination of the amount of registration tax due when a person registers a car in one state depends on the tax policy of the Member State concerned. European law \u2013 particularly the prohibition of discrimination against imported goods in favour of domestic goods \u2013 may have a bearing with respect to how the tax is calculated, especially with respect to the value attributed to second-hand cars. However, Community law does not prevent a Member State from applying a high registration tax on vehicles.\nOn the other hand, Mr Cashman\u2019s report deals with the application of an existing directive, which allows a temporary use of a vehicle in another Member State without the obligation to re-register it. I would add that this is an issue of concrete application of Community law by national authorities. The report concerns, inter alia, the interpretation of the concept of \u2018normal residence\u2019 by the national authorities, which runs counter to the principles enshrined in the directive itself.\nIn fact, the directive is able to function properly only if a person who resides in one Member State is allowed to use his vehicle in the territory of a Member State other than that where the normal residence is located. If evidence of residence in the first state is not accepted or is rendered difficult by the second state, the directive has no chance of being applied correctly. I would also remind you that the issue concerns the freedom to provide and receive services in another Member State. This is the core point of the case being discussed now.\nBefore concluding, I wish to react to some of the issues and questions raised by some of the participants in the debate. It is true that other Member States are also infringing Community law, but these infringements are in connection with other aspects of car taxation, such as discrimination in levying registration tax, and there has been no confiscation of cars, which also points to the lack of proportionality.\nAnother issue raised during the debate was whether it was legal or legitimate that actions are being taken when the European Court of Justice is still discussing the case. We sought the opinion of Parliament\u2019s Legal Service. It had no objections, and the Commission is certainly not in a position to review the view of Parliament\u2019s Legal Service.\nTo conclude, I want to say that in this case, bearing in mind that the Commission is still receiving complaints on this issue, the Commission has taken all the action possible. A case is pending before the European Court of Justice. Of course this pending case does not in any way prevent a Member State that wishes to comply with Community Law from changing its legislation in the meantime before the decision is issued. We have indeed heard that Greece has drafted or is drawing up legislation, but as we have not received any official signal from the Greek authorities, we cannot give our opinion on it.\nThe Commission very much welcomes the encouraging signals that it has received from the Greek authorities during the debates in Parliament and would also welcome this being consolidated by the adoption of the new law.\nThank you very much for your attention.", "lang": "EN", "original": "L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs, Member of the Commission .

The speech addresses improvements in Greek procedures since the start of an infringement procedure but highlights that further alignment with Community law is needed. It distinguishes between issues of high vehicle registration taxes and the specific application of EU rules on the temporary use of vehicles across Member States without re-registration requirements. The problem mainly concerns the Greek interpretation of 'normal residence' and the proportionality of confiscation as a penalty.\",\n  \"positionSum\": \"The speaker acknowledges that Greece has made progress but emphasizes that further steps are necessary to comply fully with EU directives. The Commission expresses satisfaction with recent improvements but insists on the continued need for action and legal alignment. The Commission also supports the idea that pending European Court of Justice proceedings do not prevent Greece from amending its laws promptly.\",\n  \"argSum\": \"Arguments center on the proper implementation of EU law to ensure free movement and the provision and receipt of services across Member States. The speaker highlights that the relevant EU directive only functions if residents are permitted to use their vehicles in other Member States without undue restriction. There is also mention of a lack of proportionality in penalties like car confiscation compared to mere tax discrimination, and the principle that compliance with EU law should progress irrespective of ongoing court cases.\",\n  \"propSum\": \"The Commission calls for Greece to continue legal reforms to bring national legislation in line with EU law, particularly by adopting proposed new legislation.
