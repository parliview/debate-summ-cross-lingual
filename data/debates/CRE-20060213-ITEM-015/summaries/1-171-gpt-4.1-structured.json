  "english": "Michael Cashman (PSE), rapporteur . – Mr President, it is a sadness to have to deal with this issue, which goes to the heart of the acquis communautaire . One could say that we are dealing with a Greek tragedy, but one that affects other EU citizens. On the Committee on Petitions, above all other committees, I believe we have to put aside our national and party political obligations and allegiances in order to deliver natural justice for the citizens who approach us.\nWe have received numerous petitions from citizens across the EU concerning confiscation of their cars by the Greek authorities. The petitioners have stated that Greece has not properly implemented Directive 83/182/EEC, which concerns conditions for the exemption of certain taxes and excise duties for EU citizens who are normally resident – and that is key – in another Member State. The Greek authorities have also imposed disproportionately high administrative penalties and confiscated petitioners’ property, claiming that those concerned were attempting to evade tax payments. The petitioners have been asked, in some instances, to pay up to ten times the level of customs duties without any due recognition of the actual value of the motor vehicle.\nThis report has been discussed several times in committee and was adopted by a large majority at the end of November. The petitioners came to present their petition, explaining that, in some cases, they have had to pay fees and fines of up to EUR 45 000 to retrieve their property, after the Greek authorities had impounded and confiscated their vehicles. Both I, as rapporteur, and the chairman of the Committee on Petitions have been in regular contact with the Greek authorities to try and resolve these issues and the cases that are currently before them.\nAn amendment to the law on the Greek national customs code has been adopted by the Greek Parliament. However, I am informed that this law still gives the Greek Government the power to confiscate vehicles in this situation. It is worth remembering that the petitioners have fulfilled the conditions for exemption, laid down in Directive 83/182/EEC, from, in particular, turnover tax, excise duty and other consumption tax, in respect of temporary imports from another Member State of motor-driven road vehicles. All the petitioners have their normal residence – i.e., the place where they live at least 185 days in each calendar year, because of personal or occupational ties – in a Member State other than Greece; that is, they fulfil the conditions laid down in the directive.\nThe petitioners were also able to give absolute proof of their normal place of residence by appropriate means, such as identity cards or other valid documents. Furthermore, the imposition of a special administrative penalty and, in particular, of fines set at a flat rate on the basis of the sole criterion of the cubic capacity of the vehicle – with no account being taken of the age of that vehicle – as well as of an increased duty, which, in some cases, can amount to up to ten times the taxes in question, is – not only in my opinion, but in the opinion of the Commission – incompatible with the Community principle of proportionality.\nFinally, I hope that the adoption of this report will send a very strong signal to the Greek authorities that they must amend their law so that it is in conformity with the EU directives that I have referred to. Often in the EU, we believe that the acquis communautaire is an à la carte menu from which we can pick and choose what we like. On the contrary: the acquis communautaire and being a member of the EU means that we adopt fully and transpose properly the acquis .\nI call on the Commission to tell us what actions it will be taking if the Greek authorities fail to implement the Community directive appropriately.",

    "headline": "Greek Authorities’ Car Confiscations Contravene EU Law and Proportionality, Rapporteur Calls for Compliance",
    "issueSum": "The speaker addresses the confiscation of automobiles by the Greek authorities, highlighting numerous petitions from EU citizens who claim Greece has not properly implemented Directive 83/182/EEC on exemptions from certain taxes and excise duties for residents of other Member States. The Greek authorities have confiscated vehicles and imposed high penalties, allegedly without proportionality or due regard for the actual situation and value of the vehicles.",
    "positionSum": "The speaker is critical of the Greek authorities’ actions, stating they are incompatible with EU principles and directives. He firmly supports the petitioners, emphasizing that their rights under EU law have not been duly respected and that the Greek law remains inadequate despite amendments.",
    "argSum": "The speaker argues that the petitioners have fulfilled all conditions required by the directive for tax exemption, including proving their residence in another Member State. He emphasizes that imposing large, flat-rate penalties based solely on vehicle capacity, sometimes reaching up to ten times the taxed amount, violates the EU principle of proportionality. The incompatibility is recognized by both the speaker and the European Commission.",
    "propSum": "The speaker calls for the Greek authorities to amend their laws to comply fully with relevant EU directives and urges the Commission to take action should Greece fail to do so.",

    "headline": "Greek Car Confiscations Breach EU Law and Need Urgent Reform, Says Rapporteur",
    "issueSum": "The speech addresses the issue of Greek authorities confiscating automobiles from EU citizens, specifically alleging that Greece has not properly implemented Directive 83/182/EEC concerning tax and duty exemptions for residents of other EU Member States who temporarily import vehicles. Petitioners claim that Greece has imposed disproportionately high administrative penalties and fines, sometimes up to ten times the due customs duties, without consideration of vehicle value, and in contradiction to their legal rights as EU citizens.",
    "positionSum": "The speaker is highly critical of the Greek authorities’ practices, considering them incompatible with EU law and the principle of proportionality. He advocates for upholding EU directives and ensuring that Greek law is amended to comply fully with Community rules.",
    "argSum": "The speaker argues that the actions of the Greek authorities violate EU citizens’ rights under Directive 83/182/EEC, as petitioners have fulfilled the conditions for exemption and proven their residency in another Member State. The fines and confiscations imposed by Greece are presented as excessive and inconsistent with the EU principle of proportionality. He asserts that membership of the EU entails proper and complete adoption of the acquis communautaire, and not selective compliance.",
    "propSum": "The speaker calls for Greece to amend its national law to conform with EU directives, and specifically asks the European Commission to clarify what actions it will take should Greece fail to implement the Community directive properly.",
