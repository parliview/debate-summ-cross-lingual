(DE) Mr\u00a0President, ladies and gentlemen, one week before the Spring European Council, today's debate represents an excellent opportunity for us to get together to discuss the key priorities on which this summit will focus. As you know, the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy will be central to the summit. It goes without saying that the best way of ensuring the success of such a venture is to prepare thoroughly, and the Council formations responsible for the various topics have therefore examined the priorities of the European Council from their perspective and submitted their contributions. The draft conclusions will then be examined in the course of the stipulated procedure.\nOn the opening day of the European Council, on 23\u00a0March, there will, as usual, also be the Tripartite Social Summit. This is intended to ensure cooperation between the Council, the Commission and the social partners, particularly with regard to employment, economic policy and social protection.\nIn this connection, we particularly welcome the initiatives of the European institutions for greater responsibility and greater ownership at Community level, as well as the valuable contributions made, for example, by the second interparliamentary meeting between the European Parliament and the national parliaments. A great deal is also asked of the public in this connection.\nThe governments of the Member States have the task of better explaining the urgency of implementing this partnership for growth and jobs to their citizens. In this respect, it is important for regional and local authorities \u2013 within the framework of their country's constitution \u2013 and civil society also to be involved in designing and implementing the national reform programmes.\nIn this constructive spirit, we also want today's debate to include an open discussion on options for solving the economic and social problems common to the whole European Union and on the important role that you have as the representatives of the people.\nAs you will be aware, in March 2005 the European Council agreed on an in-depth renewal of the Lisbon Strategy and also tightened up the procedure. The new governance cycle is based on partnership and responsibility. As part of their summit at Hampton Court, the Heads of State or Government gave greater political impetus to the newly revived Lisbon Strategy, focussing on the issue of how European values can reinforce the modernisation of the economy and society in a globalised world.\nIt is also important that the European Council, at its meeting last December, reached a political agreement on the financial perspective 2007-2013. That in itself is an important sign that the European Union is capable of finding solutions, although we are of course aware that we are in the process of intensive and difficult dialogue with you, which we want to pursue constructively in order to implement this agreement between the governments in cooperation with you.\nEurope is facing new challenges, including the increasing competitive pressure from outside, both economic and technological, the ageing population, rising energy prices and the need to guarantee energy security.\nSince the end of 2005 there have been signs of slow but sure economic recovery. It is projected that, in the three years from 2005 to 2007, six million new jobs will be created in the European Union. This would then reduce unemployment by almost one percentage point in 2007. However, continuing to reduce unemployment, which currently affects almost 19.5\u00a0million people, and increasing productivity and growth potential are still the greatest challenges for the European Union.\nThis economic recovery, albeit slight, forms an excellent opportunity to press on decisively with structural reforms in line with the national reform programmes and to pursue greater fiscal consolidation in line with the new Stability and Growth Pact. Concrete objectives and timetables are a useful tool for accelerating the implementation of the planned reforms and achieving better results in terms of growth and jobs.\nOn the basis of its decisions from Spring 2005, the European Council has adopted integrated strategic guidelines. The Member States have then used those guidelines as a basis to draw up national reform programmes corresponding to specific national needs. The Commission has presented a 'Community Lisbon Programme', proposing measures that should be taken at Community level. The Commission's annual progress report also makes an important contribution to the process of the renewed Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs.\nAll the Member States have drawn up their national reform programmes quickly and thoroughly. These programmes are tailored to the specific needs and circumstances of each Member State, and serve to implement the reforms. The national reform programmes are a decisive first step in progressing with greater individual responsibility and greater consciousness of the reform priorities. All in all, these national reform programmes are a good basis for future work on the reform agenda.\nIn the opinion of the Commission, however \u2013 and at this point I would quite particularly like to thank the President of the Commission, Mr\u00a0Barroso, for his institution's work, which is of great significance in the preparations for the summit, and especially for the speed and thoroughness with which they have worked \u2013 some of the programmes should include more specific objectives and timetables and additional details regarding the budgetary aspects of the proposed reforms, and go into the issues of competition and the removal of barriers to market access in greater detail.\nThe necessary instruments are in place. The Member States' top priority for 2006 will therefore be the timely and comprehensive implementation of our objectives. For this to be possible, it is vital for the Member States to intensify the measures they have already proposed.\nThe Commission has not proposed updating the guidelines for growth and jobs, which means that these guidelines will continue to be fully applicable. The focus following the major changes last year should now be on more action and more continuity.\nIn line with the new governance of the strategy, the Member States have made real efforts to get the national parliaments, representatives of local and regional authorities, the social partners and other representatives of civil society involved in designing their national programmes.\nWe now need to get the citizens of Europe more actively involved in the process, in order to convince them that timely and properly implemented reforms will contribute to greater and better distributed prosperity.\nTo do this, we really do need your House\u2019s assistance. The European Parliament can help us to give all those involved greater responsibility for, greater ownership of, the Lisbon Strategy and to secure their future participation. Debates like this one today are a particularly welcome opportunity to do so.\nIn this connection, I would also like to point out that the Austrian Presidency attaches very great importance to the compromise on the Services Directive reached at first reading here in Parliament. It is a very well-balanced outcome, and it forms a sound basis for future efforts. The sheer number of amendments proposed shows that this issue remains highly controversial. In the light of this result and of the discussions to date in the Council, the Presidency is keen that the European Council should now call on the Commission to present its amended proposal as soon as possible and express the hope that the institutions will be in a position to bring the legislative process to a swift conclusion.\nIt is the Presidency's intention that, within the framework of the integrated guidelines adopted last year, the European Council should lay down specific priority measures to be implemented by the end of 2007. As part of the renewed Lisbon Strategy, the spring summit will therefore be devoted to those issues given priority in the national reform programmes and the European Commission's report, namely research, development and innovation, policy for small and medium-sized enterprises, employment and energy. Of course, we also need to continue to take action in general in the context of all three strands of the Lisbon Strategy \u2013 economic, social and environmental. For us to be able to embark on a phase of real delivery and visible results, we need to aim for a good mix of verifiable voluntary undertakings by the 25 Member States and recommendations from the Commission. How high we should set our sights is currently still being discussed as part of the preparations for the Council.\nOne pillar of the Lisbon Strategy is research and innovation, as the driving force behind production and knowledge use. It is now four years since we set ourselves the target of achieving research spending of 3% in Europe by 2010, with a significant proportion of this funding, two-thirds, to come from the private sector. It would be a good idea for the resources available from the European Union to rise in step with our own national efforts. To that end, we also need to increase cooperation between universities, research and business to help increase research funding.\nAs we are all aware, though, we have not really got very far in this area, which is so important for our future \u2013 research spending in the EU currently stands at only about 1.9%.\nOur joint efforts with the European Commission have enabled us to develop some momentum and to raise awareness in the Member States that specific goals and voluntary commitments to increase research spending are important. In this respect all the Member States have already raised their sights and set their national targets accordingly.\nMoreover, in our fast-paced information society, modern communications strategies play a vital role in promoting innovation. In terms of higher education, we would like to call on the Member States, by 2007, to make it easier for universities to access additional private sponsorship and to break down barriers to cooperation between academic institutions and business, in accordance with their national conventions.\nSecondly, more needs to be done to open up the framework conditions for businesses, business potential and, in particular, the situation of small and medium-sized enterprises. This also needs to be a focus within the European Council. Small and medium-sized enterprises form a major part of the European economy and can justifiably be described as its driving force. There are around 23\u00a0million small and medium-sized enterprises in the European Union, providing almost 75\u00a0million jobs. Measures to strengthen and promote small and medium-sized enterprises as the backbone of the European economy can therefore make a significant contribution to growth and jobs. We also want to cut red tape for SMEs and reduce the time and costs involved in setting up new businesses.\n(The President cut off the speaker.)", "lang": "EN", "original": "Hans Winkler, President-in-Office of the Council .

(FR) Mr\u00a0President, ladies and gentlemen, next week\u2019s European Council took place at an important moment. We are now seeing the first encouraging signs of greater consumer confidence in Europe: investment is taking off again and growth figures are progressively improving. That is good news. Let us take advantage of this favourable economic context to take a new leap forward towards our objectives of growth and employment. Let us move up a gear.\nLast year, we proposed an in-depth review of how to steer economic policy in Europe. We agreed to work together within a partnership. We shared the responsibilities among ourselves and refocused our strategy and concerns on the essentials. Your Assembly accorded huge support to this new approach, and I should like to congratulate Parliament on the role it is playing in this connection.\nIn its report to the spring European Council, the Commission proposed several priority measures in favour of growth and employment. I do not wish to go into detail concerning all of the specific measures we propose taking but shall single out a number of themes that I think are particularly important today.\nI am now delighted that 25 national programmes of reform have been adopted, describing how, in terms of the actual circumstances peculiar to itself as a nation, each Member State intends implementing the jointly agreed guidelines for growth and employment. Admittedly, not all of the national plans for reform are equally ambitious. Nor, it is true, are they all of the same quality. Nonetheless, they do constitute a sound basis on which to work.\nLet us be clear. This is only a first stage, and everyone knows that reports do not create jobs. We now need to see political will and determination in putting these intentions specifically into practice.\nThat is why, this year, it is time to translate words into deeds. During the next few months, the Commission will work in close cooperation with the Member States with a view to helping implement their national programmes and to following these up. I am very grateful to Parliament for the role it is adopting in this connection. The joint parliamentary sittings held by the European Parliament and representatives of the national parliaments and devoted to the Lisbon Strategy have made a significant contribution to raising the national parliaments\u2019 awareness of what is at stake and have encouraged them to participate in the process.\nLadies and gentlemen, the fact is, however, that, in terms of the Member States\u2019 taking this new strategy for growth and employment to heart, there is still work to be done. Within the framework of the partnership, the Member States draw lessons from others\u2019 experience. Everyone has something both to offer and to learn, but I can never emphasise enough that we not only need action at the level of the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament but also need actively to involve the national parliaments, social partners, national parties \u2013 and not only the European parties \u2013 and European public opinion. That is a condition for our renewed strategy for growth and employment succeeding.\nAnother important issue is that of the free movement of workers. I noted that, in the resolution it proposed by way of concluding this debate, Parliament called on the Member States, and I quote, \u2018to move as fast as possible towards total freedom of movement for workers and other citizens within the EU and to undertake determined action to promote the quality of work in all its aspects\u2019. I entirely concur with this proposal of the European Parliament. What is more, the facts prove you right. A recent study by the Commission clearly shows that the flow of workers from the Central and Eastern European Member States into the old Member States has, in the main, had beneficial effects. That is only one of the reasons why the Commission welcomes the announcement made recently \u2013 and, more specifically, after the publication of our communication \u2013 by Finland, Portugal and Spain in the first instance and now by the Netherlands to the effect that they were joining Ireland, the United Kingdom and Sweden in lifting the restrictions on the free movement of workers in Europe. I am impatient to see other countries join them.\n(Applause)\nIn a globalised economy, no Member State can allow itself to go it alone. This is not the moment for economic nationalism. It is not by employing nationalist rhetoric that we shall be able to build the Europe of tomorrow.\n(Applause)\nDefending one\u2019s national champions in the short term generally leads, in the longer term, to relegating them to the second division. More efficient companies, which have had to face all the rigours of competition, will overtake the national champions once they appear on the international markets. Let us be clear. What we need is not national champions, but world champions that are based in Europe and benefit fully from our internal market.\n(Applause)\nLet there be no misunderstandings, however. The Commission will exercise its prerogatives if companies abuse their dominant position in the market. The Commission is required by law to protect the consumer and to ensure that the rules of competition are applied, and it will carry out those duties in full.\nThe challenge of globalisation calls for a strengthening of the internal market. Freedom to provide services is an essential element of the internal market, and we have already said that the services sector, on the one hand, and small and medium-sized enterprises, on the other, are the most relevant drivers today for employment in Europe.\nI want to thank you for the result of Parliament\u2019s first reading of the Services Directive. You came forward with amendments generally based on a broad consensus which can now move us forward. The Commission will respond positively to your consensus.\nEarly next month we will present an amended proposal, which will be largely based on this first reading and the discussions in the Council. We know that the Austrian Presidency will work on the common position of the Council shortly thereafter. I hope that this legislation can then be adopted swiftly, as we need to make progress in this area if we are serious about growth and jobs.\n(Applause)\nThe energy challenges of the 21st century require a strong and effective response. After a long period of relative stability, we can no longer take secure and affordable energy supplies for granted. Increased import dependence, higher energy prices and climate change are challenges shared by all European Union Member States. Only a European response, based on sustainability, competitiveness and security, can deal with the magnitude of these challenges.\nIn the Commission\u2019s Green Paper we have highlighted six key actions. We must create a truly single European electricity and gas market. We must achieve better integration. With better integration comes more solidarity between the Member States in times of crisis. We must accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy, using both new energies and existing ones to ensure sustainability. We must change not just energy supply but energy demand. There is considerable scope to use energy more efficiently to the benefit of the climate, consumers and our security.\nEurope is at the leading edge of the development of low-carbon technologies. We must stay there. We need more European innovation for renewables and everything that concerns environmentally friendly technologies. Last but not least, we must foster a more coherent and integrated approach in our relations with third countries and in international fora.\nI sometimes hear people say that a European energy policy is not feasible because it touches areas where Member States have national strategic interests. I do not need to remind you that the very basis of the European Community was in fact a common European policy on coal and steel, the two areas which were considered the most sensitive in terms of the national strategic interest of the Member States at that time. It is exactly because energy is strategic that we need a European strategy and not 25 national strategies. That is precisely the reason why we need that strategy.\n(Applause)\nThe Green Paper invites everybody to contribute to this important debate. I am very encouraged by the good reaction that our Green Paper received and by the very committed support of the Austrian Presidency, and I look forward to strong support from the European Parliament for this new European Union strategy.\nI also want to stress the need for social cohesion to be considered an integral part of the growth and jobs creation strategy. The Commission is keenly aware of the need to ensure high-quality jobs and avoid precarious working conditions. I believe that globalisation offers major opportunities, but we cannot and should not ignore the pressure on companies and workers resulting from fierce international competition. That is why the Commission has proposed a European globalisation adjustment fund. That fund will act as a shock absorber to the powerful engine of globalisation. It will complement Member States\u2019 efforts to help get the workers affected back on their feet again. The important thing is to get people retrained and back on the job ladder in a sustainable way. We need to involve social partners in our discussions on jobs and labour markets.\nEurope\u2019s economic future depends on having the best educated and trained people, with a full range of skills and the adaptability required for a knowledge economy. That is why we must boost investment in higher education significantly. The Commission suggests a target of 2% of GDP by 2010.\nAt the same time, we must boost Europe\u2019s research and development spending to 3% of GDP by 2010. That means more ambitious national targets and more ambitious measures to achieve them. We have some excellent universities and research centres which will really benefit from more funding. However, our systems are fragmented. There is a gap between higher education and research, on the one hand, and companies and the economy on the other. They do not appear to be connected.\nToo many of our top brains are leaving Europe. That is why the Commission, in search of excellence, has proposed a European institute of technology. A European institute of technology would complement other measures; it would use the resources made available by its participating partners and do so more effectively for their benefit and for the benefit of the entire European Union economy. It is an ambitious project. I will be asking the Heads of State and Government to endorse this idea and I am asking Parliament for support. Airbus and Galileo have shown us the importance of successful European flagships. The EIT should be the next one; it is a symbol of a European purpose, but it is not just a symbol: it adds value to our collective efforts in terms of research, education and innovation.\nI am also aware of the need to do more in this area and I believe that this can be a clear commitment now for this knowledge triangle. In short, more commitment to Europe will bring more prosperity and freedom to our citizens.\nI warmly thank you for your support so well expressed in your motion for a resolution. Next week the European Council must show a similar commitment to growth and jobs. The time has now come for delivery, not of more words but of action.\n(Applause)", "lang": "EN", "original": "Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, President of the Commission. (FR) Mr\u00a0President, ladies and gentlemen, next week\u2019s European Council took place at an important moment. We are now seeing the first encouraging signs of greater consumer confidence in Europe: investment is taking off again and growth figures are progressively improving. That is good news. Let us take advantage of this favourable economic context to take a new leap forward towards our objectives of growth and employment. Let us move up a gear.\nLast year, we proposed an in-depth review of how to steer economic policy in Europe. We agreed to work together within a partnership. We shared the responsibilities among ourselves and refocused our strategy and concerns on the essentials. Your Assembly accorded huge support to this new approach, and I should like to congratulate Parliament on the role it is playing in this connection.\nIn its report to the spring European Council, the Commission proposed several priority measures in favour of growth and employment. I do not wish to go into detail concerning all of the specific measures we propose taking but shall single out a number of themes that I think are particularly important today.\nI am now delighted that 25 national programmes of reform have been adopted, describing how, in terms of the actual circumstances peculiar to itself as a nation, each Member State intends implementing the jointly agreed guidelines for growth and employment. Admittedly, not all of the national plans for reform are equally ambitious. Nor, it is true, are they all of the same quality. Nonetheless, they do constitute a sound basis on which to work.\nLet us be clear. This is only a first stage, and everyone knows that reports do not create jobs. We now need to see political will and determination in putting these intentions specifically into practice.\nThat is why, this year, it is time to translate words into deeds. During the next few months, the Commission will work in close cooperation with the Member States with a view to helping implement their national programmes and to following these up. I am very grateful to Parliament for the role it is adopting in this connection.

Mr\u00a0Winkler, we think very highly of you as a person, and we appreciate the fact that you are here, but when the President of the Commission is here it would be appropriate for the Presidency of the Council to be represented at a similarly high level, by a minister. We need to bear that in mind. I would like to make it clear that I have the greatest respect for you personally, but the institutions must have equal representation in such debates. I say that quite independent of any party-political affiliation. This is about the institutions of the European Union.\nThe European Parliament gives a high priority to the Lisbon process, which is a continuous process and is not limited to 2010. That is why we set up the steering group under the chairmanship of Mr\u00a0Daul. I am pleased that the three largest groups \u2013 yes, and maybe one day the others will join in too, Mr\u00a0Wurtz \u2013 are putting this at the heart of their activities, as of course is the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, even though they are not here, and maybe some others too ...\n(Protests)\n.... it is true, the leaders are not here, and you should be pleased that I am paying so much attention to them. The single market, the free movement of persons, goods, services and capital, is the precondition for the European Union to be competitive on the global markets.\nI call on the Heads of State or Government and on the governments to take Parliament's efforts regarding the Services Directive as their example. To the governments I say: anyone who now wants to achieve something different will destroy this compromise on the Services Directive. I therefore call on the governments to take the European Parliament as their example.\nI also welcome the fact \u2013 this is not my job, but I am pleased as the chairman of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats \u2013 that one of the leaders of the Greens is now here. Together we will forge Europe, Mr\u00a0Cohn-Bendit.\nWe need the entrepreneurial spirit in the European Union. Enterprises are not an abstract concept, and getting involved means making freedom a reality. Entrepreneurial spirit means creating jobs. We need a positive perspective in this connection.\nMr\u00a0Barroso, we welcome the proposal you have put forward for a European Institute of Technology. This must involve creating not a big new university authority, but a network between the various European technological institutes already in existence, so that we get added value and so that Europe can really be one of the global leaders in innovation and research. You referred to GALILEO and Airbus. We need new projects, and to that extent we support your considerations.\nOne final remark, as I do not have 15 minutes like the Council and the Commission: at some point, Mr\u00a0President, we need to think about how we can achieve a better balance. I would advocate that this House should work closely with the national parliaments on this issue, because it is our joint task, both nationally and in Europe, to make Europe competitive and to ensure that it develops well economically and in general.\n(Applause)", "lang": "DE", "original": "Hans-Gert Poettering, im Namen der PPE-DE-Fraktion . \u2013 Herr Pr\u00e4sident, Herr Kommissionspr\u00e4sident, Herr Ratspr\u00e4sident, liebe Kolleginnen und Kollegen!

Sagen Sie es auch im Rat bei dem Treffen der Staats- und Regierungschefs. Herr Staatssekret\u00e4r Winkler, wir sch\u00e4tzen Sie sehr als Pers\u00f6nlichkeit und dass Sie hier sind, aber wenn der Kommissionspr\u00e4sident hier ist, dann w\u00e4re es auch angemessen, dass auch die Ratspr\u00e4sidentschaft entsprechend hochrangig mit einem Minister vertreten w\u00e4re. Auch dar\u00fcber m\u00fcssen wir einmal nachdenken. Ich m\u00f6chte ausdr\u00fccklich meinen Respekt vor Ihrer Person zum Ausdruck bringen, aber die Institutionen m\u00fcssen auch gleichwertig in solchen Debatten vertreten sein. Ich sage das unabh\u00e4ngig von parteipolitischer Zugeh\u00f6rigkeit. Es geht um die Institutionen der Europ\u00e4ischen Union.\nDas Europ\u00e4ische Parlament gibt dem Lissabon-Prozess \u2013 der ja ein st\u00e4ndiger Prozess ist und der nicht begrenzt ist auf das Jahr 2010 \u2013 eine gro\u00dfe Priorit\u00e4t. Deswegen haben wir die Lenkungsgruppe unter Vorsitz unseres Kollegen Joseph Daul eingesetzt. Ich bin froh dar\u00fcber, dass die drei gr\u00f6\u00dften Fraktionen \u2013 ja, vielleicht kommen die anderen noch eines Tages dazu, Francis Wurtz \u2013 dies zu einem Kern ihrer Arbeit machen, und nat\u00fcrlich auch die Gr\u00fcnen, die aber jetzt gar nicht da sind, und vielleicht noch einige andere ...\n(Protestbekundungen)\n.... ja, die Vorsitzenden sind nicht da, also freuen Sie sich doch dar\u00fcber, wenn ich Ihren Vorsitzenden so viel Aufmerksamkeit schenke. Der gemeinsame Binnenmarkt, der freie Austausch von Personen, Waren, Dienstleistungen und Kapital ist die Voraussetzung daf\u00fcr, dass die Europ\u00e4ische Union auf den Weltm\u00e4rkten wettbewerbsf\u00e4hig ist.\nIch fordere die Staats- und Regierungschef sowie die Regierungen auf, dass sie sich an dem Bem\u00fchen des Parlaments um die Dienstleistungsrichtlinie ein Beispiel nehmen. Ich sage den Regierungen: Wer jetzt meint, dass er etwas anderes erreichen will, der zerst\u00f6rt diesen Kompromiss der Dienstleistungsrichtlinie. Deswegen fordere ich die Regierungen auf, sich ein Beispiel am Europ\u00e4ischen Parlament zu nehmen.\nIch begr\u00fc\u00dfe auch \u2013 das ist nicht meine Aufgabe, aber ich freue mich als Vorsitzender der EVP-ED-Fraktion\u00a0\u2013, dass einer der Vorsitzenden der Gr\u00fcnen jetzt auch da ist. Gemeinsam werden wir Europa schaffen, Herr Kollege Daniel Cohn-Bendit.\nWir brauchen Unternehmergeist in der Europ\u00e4ischen Union. Unternehmen sind ja nichts Abstraktes, sondern sich zu engagieren bedeutet die Verwirklichung von Freiheit. Unternehmergeist bedeutet Schaffung von Arbeitspl\u00e4tzen.

Dies darf nicht bedeuten, dass eine neue gro\u00dfe universit\u00e4re Beh\u00f6rde geschaffen wird, sondern ein Netzwerk zwischen den verschiedenen bestehenden europ\u00e4ischen technologischen Instituten, so dass wir einen Mehrwert bekommen und dass Europa in der Frage der Innovation, in der Frage der Forschung wirklich mit f\u00fchrend wird in der Welt.

The starting point used in Lisbon was that we would only be able to survive intercontinental competition and continue to compete with competitors on other continents over the long term if we become the strongest knowledge-based society and national economy in the world \u2013 but at European level.\nIt was the right step to take, but what has happened since then? Those who decided to take this step cannot decide whether they want to take it at European or national level. They are pulled back and forth between the message that 'we can only survive in this competition as a united Europe', which is right, and the message in their own country that 'actually, in principle we are strong enough as a government to do it ourselves', which of course is more popular with the voters. The result is that there has not been enough investment in the Lisbon process at either European or national level. That is the situation after six years!\n(Applause)\nMr\u00a0President of the Commission, I am grateful for what you said, but I also regret that you are keeping quiet on something else. There is a gaping chasm between what you have once again described as being necessary as a commitment, including financially, and what happens in practice. You and your Commission have described what is needed in terms of funding for the EU over the next seven years, and the Council has adopted a financial basis. The problem is, there is a gap of 40.82% between what you asked for and what the Council decided!\nThe Council agreed to 40.82% less than you had requested for the financial perspective. Those, Mr\u00a0President, are the different messages, the different-shaped bricks. You cannot build a beautiful house with different-shaped bricks. You cannot even build a shack. You cannot even build a ski hut in Arlberg am Lech \u2013 or rather Lech am Arlberg \u2013 to sing sea shanties in of an evening. Welcome to the valley, Mr\u00a0President! The downhill race is now over.\n(Laughter)\nThe troika on the financial perspective, which we will experience in the next few days, and the subsequent summit once again draw attention to this discrepancy. The troika is ruled by penny-pinchers, scraping together every last Euro so that the money cannot be given to Europe.\n(Applause)\nThree days later, the Heads of State or Government will meet, and once again proclaim how important the Lisbon summit and the Lisbon objectives are. That is precisely what is holding Europe up: there is no coherent, consistent approach to the Lisbon process!\nIn the European Parliament, we have tried to combine the flexibility Europe needs with the social cohesion it cannot do without, because these two aspects belong together. If we want to take the people with us \u2013 yes, Mr\u00a0Winkler, you are quite right there \u2013 if we want the people to come with us, we must depict globalisation as an opportunity, but also reduce the risk that it could be used to break down social standards. With the Services Directive, we tried to say yes to flexibility where necessary and possible, but only if we retain social cohesion. I therefore assume that the European Parliament's decision will form the basis for the Commission and Council to continue consultations on the Services Directive. I can only warn against deviating from it. You made the promise, Mr\u00a0Winkler, and you said today that you would keep that promise. We will ensure that you do, you can be sure of that!\nIt is indeed the case that enough ink has been used up on the subject of the future of the Lisbon process. What we need is investment in research and qualifications, so that our best people do not drift away to other continents. What we need is investment in lifelong learning, because, if good qualifications are a prerequisite for access to the labour market, then lifelong learning is a basic right that guarantees that everybody has that access.\nYesterday, the President of the Federal Republic of Germany clarified the desires of young people in Europe using the example of the Erasmus scheme. However, Erasmus is one of the points where the Council has reduced the financial perspective the most. So, I will say it again: in the Lisbon process, nothing fits together.\n(Applause)", "lang": "DE", "original": "Martin Schulz, im Namen der PSE-Fraktion . \u2013 Herr Pr\u00e4sident, meine sehr verehrten Damen und Herren! Der Lissabon-Prozess war, als er auf den Weg gebracht wurde, der erste richtige, meiner Meinung nach auch sehr durchdachte Versuch, eine europ\u00e4ische Antwort auf die Herausforderungen der Globalisierung zu geben.

Wer die Bev\u00f6lkerung mitnehmen will \u2013 jawohl, Herr Staatssekret\u00e4r Winkler, da haben Sie Recht\u00a0\u2013, wer will, dass die Menschen mitgehen, der muss die Globalisierung als Chance beschreiben, der muss aber auch das Risiko mindern, dass Globalisierung immer zum Abbau sozialer Standards benutzt wird. Wir haben bei der Dienstleistungsrichtlinie versucht zu sagen, Flexibilit\u00e4t wo n\u00f6tig und m\u00f6glich, ja, aber unter Erhalt der sozialen Koh\u00e4sion. Und deshalb gehe ich davon aus, dass die Beschlussfassung des Europ\u00e4ischen Parlaments f\u00fcr Kommission und Rat die Grundlage bei der weiteren Beratung zur Dienstleistungsrichtlinie ist.

If any company can see commercial logic in merging with another, what business is it of ours to put roadblocks in its path? The great success of the euro, as the President of the Commission has pointed out, is that mergers and takeovers are proceeding apace. European industry is gearing up for the challenges of competing in a global economy.\nThese are issues for the Spring Council. They are issues for the Commission because the Commission is going to be tested in this climate as a defender and guarantor of the Treaties. Faced with an unprecedented assault on the internal market, the Commission must hold firm to the Treaties, hold firm to the basic freedoms and speak out when necessary \u2013 as you have, President Barroso, and as Commissioners McCreevy and Kroes have too \u2013 and act to defend the Union. But defence of the single market falls not only to the Commission; the Council has a role, as we stress in the motion we debate today. That means the Spring Council expediting transposition and implementation of the Union\u2019s directives to deliver a single market with free movement of goods, services and capital. We want to see the European Council deal seriously with free movement of services, free movement of workers and free movement of capital. As they discuss the future financing of our Union, let the Heads of State and Government find the funds necessary for the training of our workforce, for the trans-European networks and for research and development through the European Institute for Technology, which will secure future economic dynamism.\nIt is time for our Heads of State and Government to formalise the Council meetings that take place in March and October. These need not be billed purely as economic policy summits; the demands of energy security, of peace in the Middle-East and of fighting internationally organised crime are equally urgent and should be on next week\u2019s agenda. There should be public discussion too of the Union\u2019s burgeoning defence policy, currently being planned behind closed doors.

If any company can see commercial logic in merging with another, what business is it of ours to put roadblocks in its path? The great success of the euro, as the President of the Commission has pointed out, is that mergers and takeovers are proceeding apace. European industry is gearing up for the challenges of competing in a global economy.\nThese are issues for the Spring Council. They are issues for the Commission because the Commission is going to be tested in this climate as a defender and guarantor of the Treaties. Faced with an unprecedented assault on the internal market, the Commission must hold firm to the Treaties, hold firm to the basic freedoms and speak out when necessary \u2013 as you have, President Barroso, and as Commissioners McCreevy and Kroes have too \u2013 and act to defend the Union. But defence of the single market falls not only to the Commission; the Council has a role, as we stress in the motion we debate today. That means the Spring Council expediting transposition and implementation of the Union\u2019s directives to deliver a single market with free movement of goods, services and capital. We want to see the European Council deal seriously with free movement of services, free movement of workers and free movement of capital. As they discuss the future financing of our Union, let the Heads of State and Government find the funds necessary for the training of our workforce, for the trans-European networks and for research and development through the European Institute for Technology, which will secure future economic dynamism.\nIt is time for our Heads of State and Government to formalise the Council meetings that take place in March and October. These need not be billed purely as economic policy summits; the demands of energy security, of peace in the Middle-East and of fighting internationally organised crime are equally urgent and should be on next week\u2019s agenda. There should be public discussion too of the Union\u2019s burgeoning defence policy, currently being planned behind closed doors.

There is absolutely no willingness to discuss important instruments that would guarantee success. In this coordination structure, we tried to discuss fiscal policy.

You will not reduce dependency on raw materials, and you will not be in a position to secure fair prices on the energy market.

Well, it could have called its Lisbon Strategy \u2018Janus\u2019 after the famous Roman deity, traditionally represented as having two faces: one looking to the future and the other to the past, exactly like the Lisbon agenda.\nOne of these faces of the Lisbon Strategy for the ten-year period 2000\u20132010 is pleasing and calls to mind the conclusions of the 2005 spring European Council with their talk of the need for, and I quote, \u2018investing in human capital [which is] Europe\u2019s most important asset\u2019. It heralds more jobs \u2013 even full employment \u2013 as well as better quality jobs. It emphasises the importance of research, education and innovation, as well as of having a solid industrial fabric throughout the territory of the EU. It even puts forward the objective, and I quote, of \u2018halting the loss of biological diversity between now and 2010\u2019.\nThat particular face of the European Janus looks towards the future. It seems to herald such an era of social, economic and ecological progress that, at first sight, it is difficult to understand why the Commission considers, and I quote, that \u2018[a] lot remains to be done to convince people that reforms will contribute to greater, shared prosperity and to involve them in the process\u2019.\nWhy, for heaven\u2019s sake? It is because there is the other face of the Lisbon Strategy, this one directed towards the EU leaders\u2019 unrelenting liberal obsessions. I would refer to the latest Commission communication with its references to, for example, the need to make Europe more attractive to business, to reforming pensions, the health sector and the labour market and to stabilising the budget, raising the retirement age, increasing productivity at work, ensuring genuine competition in the services sector and promoting increased competition in the electricity and gas markets.\nThe Commission even expects the unions to play a role in the proliferation of this liberal strategy and expects Parliament also to convey its virtues.\nWe are seeing German civil servants joining forces to protest against longer working hours and lower salaries and Italian employees demanding a thorough review of law 30 and the way in which it blithely generates job insecurity. We are seeing young French people rebelling against plans for two-year contracts of employment enabling bosses to dismiss them at will, female salaried staff in Britain challenging plans to raise the retirement age from 60 to 65 years and employees in the new Member States of Central Europe opposed to their countries being considered part of a low cost zone and demanding their rights to social progress. Faced with these people and, indeed, all those opposed to the strategy of squeezing public and social expenditure that is being conducted under the aegis of the Stability Pact, do not, I beseech you, rely on us to explain to them that they are mistaken because, contrary to appearances, the Lisbon Strategy has their well-being at heart.\nThe truth of the matter is that the two aspects of the Lisbon Strategy are incompatible.

It now appears that this was not a pause for thought but, rather, entailed a change in the order of who is to ratify and when. Since the two \u2018no\u2019 votes, the Constitution has been approved in Luxembourg, Cyprus, Malta, Latvia and, most recently, Belgium. The process is under way in Estonia, and Finland will approve the Constitution before it takes over the Presidency on 1\u00a0July. A delegation of us from the Committee on Constitutional Affairs visited Helsinki the other day. Just one small party, representing true Finns, will respect the French and Dutch \u2018no\u2019 votes. The Constitution proposes that ratifications be allowed to continue until 80% of the countries have approved the Constitution, at which point a special summit would take place. The provisions of the Constitution cannot, however, be the basis for changing the Treaty of Nice, where unanimity is the rule. The Constitution is therefore formally dead following the French and Dutch \u2018no\u2019 votes. In the Netherlands the government has stated that it will not ratify the rejected document, and in France the leading politicians say the same thing. It is therefore illegal to continue with the ratifications without a new decision, unless France and the Netherlands are engaging in double-dealing and saying one thing at home and something else in Brussels.\nI should like to ask the Presidency whether France and the Netherlands have formally agreed that the ratifications can continue without changes to the rejected document. Would it not be better to use the breathing space to think out new ideas and so prepare a document that people can approve in referenda in all the countries on the same day, a document in which the key headings could be transparency, democracy and proximity to the people?", "lang": "DA", "original": "Jens-Peter Bonde, for IND/DEM-Gruppen . - Hr. formand Efter det franske og hollandske nej til forfatningen besluttede EU-topm\u00f8det at arrangere t\u00e6nkepause om Europas fremtid.

The global market is benevolent towards economic entities that are efficient, competitive and which offer cheap, good quality products and services. The direct involvement of Member States and parliaments in implementation programmes can be counted as one of the successes of activities aimed at pursuing the Lisbon Strategy. Action related to the energy security programme may also create better, stable conditions for economic development. The fact that a large group of people is taking part in the implementation of the strategy may also give rise to optimism. The problem lies in the effectiveness of the actions and the resistance shown towards them. These actions include the creation of an internal market, a labour market, the right conditions for restructuring and the creation of businesses and the growth of innovation, while simultaneously doing away with unemployment and increasing wages. We need a consensus between political groups, trade unions and employers. There are particularly significant obstacles to the process of restructuring, organising of the agricultural market and limiting agricultural production costs. The lack of viability in some production sectors means that large numbers of holdings are facing liquidation and that there is an increase in unemployment and unused land. This is why it is vital to take rapid action to establish an agricultural production system with a guaranteed market, such as bio-fuels and biomass. We need a multi-annual programme to adapt farming to new market conditions. The process of scrapping protectionism, which does not create but only decreases added value and increases social costs, faces large obstacles.

That is the threat hovering over the Lisbon Strategy. With a meagre financial perspective, unbalanced national budgets and a Community budget representing less than a third of the American budget\u2019s mere deficit, is the EU reduced merely to making gestures?\nThe draft resolution I have prepared together with my excellent fellow Member, Mr\u00a0Lehne, indicates a few worthwhile paths to go down, even if our Parliament sometimes refuses to look the truth in the face. Thus, the majority of MEPs have ignored the fact that a substantial portion of the United States\u2019s growth surplus in recent years was the result of integrating more than ten million legal immigrants. We need a more generous European immigration policy. Would such a policy be conducted at the expense of developing countries? According to the United Nations, transfers of money from immigrants to their families represent more than double the amount spent on international development aid. The spectacular economic development of India, China, Taiwan and Hong Kong owes a lot to companies set up by former emigrants who have returned home.\nThe Europe of research is still to be built. It is mainly medium-sized companies that do not invest enough. One of the causes of this phenomenon is the excessive bureaucracy hindering access to European funds. Another is the lack of cooperation between businesses and universities. The latter should be able to obtain more resources for themselves by investing in promising young talent and by increasing the prestige of their research activities through the conferring of associated diplomas and degrees.\nWhere energy is concerned, Europe must combine with the other big consumers \u2013 the United States, Japan, China and India \u2013 in order to counterbalance the cartels and oligopolies that dominate the oil and gas sectors. Faced with a market dominated by a handful of producer companies, there is no point in seeking refuge in the mere liberalisation of the European market, especially when such liberalisation leads to the emergence of a small number of so-called European champions which will end up dividing the market between themselves. In the case of the American energy market, liberalisation was far from being a success.\nThe demographic development faced by Europe constitutes more than just a challenge for the funding of social security. The ten or twenty years\u2019 increase in life expectancy for generally fit and healthy populations also presents a great opportunity. Strategies need to be devised enabling people to remain active as they get older, as well as to be offered a range of retirement options and to be integrated into the wider life of society.

Unfortunately, the answer to this question is a sobering one; following the political shock administered by the \u2018no\u2019 vote against the constitution, we now face the threat of economic paralysis, of Lisbon becoming, like the celebrated woman without the lower half of her body, an attraction in a freak show, for, despite the consensus that the strategy\u2019s implementation is the responsibility of the Member States, it is these that we see committing protectionist fouls in the name of economic patriotism, and this is cause for considerable concern.\nThose who imagine that we could achieve \u2018more Lisbon\u2019 or become more competitive with less of an internal market have either lost their grip on reality or are being dishonest. Europe\u2019s economic success over the last fifty years was founded upon the four freedoms of the internal market, three of which are now in acute danger. This began two years ago when, among others, Germany and Austria imposed restrictions on the mobility of labour from the Member States in the east of the EU. It now turns out that countries that did not interfere in labour mobility, such as Great Britain, can testify to the benefits of this.\nLet us consider the free movement of capital. Italy is forbidding the purchase of interests in Italian banks; Poland is opposing the merger of UniCredit and HBV; the French and the Spanish are resisting the takeover of domestic energy suppliers. That is particularly ironic in view of the fact that it is in the energy sector that a European approach is called for, for are we to believe that we can have a common energy policy without an internal market in energy? The Commission\u2019s unambiguous words on this subject are much to be welcomed, and it is to be hoped that the Council will follow its recommendations.\nThe third freedom, of the provision of services, is also at risk. What the watering-down of the Services Directive perpetrated by Germany, Belgium and France means is nothing more or less than that the division of labour in this area is not yet forthcoming. Were this to apply to the movement of goods, it would mean, for example, that Renault would be allowed to export its cars to Germany only if they were, once there, to cost no more or less than a Volkswagen. And what are we to think of Skoda? Workers in Mlad\u00e1 Boleslav earn less than their counterparts who assemble Audis or Citro\u00ebns; is that social dumping too? The logical consequence of the trade unions\u2019 arguments on the services directive is that they should call for punitive customs duties on industrial products from Member States where wages are lower, and it is only a matter of time before they do that. I might add that, if you consider the issue consistently, the demands made of the new Member States that they should increase their taxes on enterprises amount to precisely the same thing.\nLisbon is no more an end in itself than is the internal market. What is needed at the heart of the continent of Europe is new growth, and more of it, if the millions of unemployed are to have new hope for the future. Giving them that is a matter of obligation \u2013 politically, socially, and, in the final analysis, morally. Jeopardising the internal market is a sin against the unemployed of Europe, to whom we have obligations, in that it is for their sakes, for the sake of the weakest members of our society, that we have to make Lisbon a success. The same is true in the case of older people; this House\u2019s resolution stresses the significance of demographic change, and both the elderly of today and those of tomorrow merit our attention. Growth is what is needed to stabilise our social security systems; redistribution alone will not do the job. I would like to add that I believe we should be conducting this debate in Brussels rather than in Strasbourg.", "lang": "DE", "original": "Alexander Lambsdorff (ALDE). \u2013 Herr Pr\u00e4sident! Ein Jahr nach der Halbzeitbilanz der Lissabon-Agenda ist es Zeit, erneut zu fragen, wo Europa steht. Die Antwort auf diese Frage f\u00e4llt leider ern\u00fcchternd aus: Nach dem politischen Schock durch das Nein gegen die Verfassung droht jetzt \u00f6konomische L\u00e4hmung. Lissabon droht zu einer Jahrmarktattraktion zu werden, der ber\u00fchmten Dame ohne Unterleib. Denn es gibt ja einen Konsens, dass die Umsetzung der Strategie Sache der Mitgliedstaaten ist, aber gerade dort sehen wir unter dem Schlagwort des Wirtschaftspatriotismus protektionistische Fehltritte, die Anlass zu erheblicher Sorge geben.\nDie Vorstellung, wir k\u00f6nnten mehr Lissabon, mehr Wettbewerbsf\u00e4higkeit mit weniger Binnenmarkt erreichen, zeugt entweder von Realit\u00e4tsverlust oder von Unehrlichkeit. Europas wirtschaftlicher Erfolg beruhte in den letzten f\u00fcnfzig Jahren auf den vier Freiheiten des Binnenmarktes. Von diesen sind drei akut gef\u00e4hrdet. Es begann vor zwei Jahren mit der Beschr\u00e4nkung der Mobilit\u00e4t f\u00fcr Arbeitskr\u00e4fte aus den EU-Mitgliedsl\u00e4ndern in Osteuropa durch Deutschland, \u00d6sterreich und andere. Nun zeigt sich aber, dass L\u00e4nder, die nicht in die Arbeitnehmermobilit\u00e4t eingegriffen haben, wie Gro\u00dfbritannien, von positiven Erfahrungen berichten.\nSchauen wir auf den freien Kapitalverkehr: Italien verbietet den Erwerb von Beteiligungen an italienischen Kreditinstituten, Polen wendet sich gegen die Fusion von UniCredit und HBV, Franzosen und Spanier wehren sich gegen die \u00dcbernahme von heimischen Energieversorgern. Das ist besonders ironisch, denn gerade im Energiesektor ist ein europ\u00e4isches Vorgehen angesagt. Glauben wir denn, wir k\u00f6nnten eine gemeinsame Energiepolitik ohne einen Energiebinnenmarkt erreichen? Die Klarheit der Kommission ist in dieser Frage sehr zu begr\u00fc\u00dfen. Es ist zu hoffen, dass der Rat ihren Empfehlungen folgt.\nDie dritte Freiheit \u2013 die der Dienstleistungen \u2013 ist ebenfalls in Gefahr. Die von Deutschland, Belgien und Frankreich betriebene Verw\u00e4sserung der Dienstleistungsrichtlinie bedeutet nichts anderes, als dass die Arbeitsteilung auf diesem Gebiet weiter aufgehoben bleibt. \u00dcbertragen auf den Warenverkehr w\u00fcrde dies bedeuten, dass z.\u00a0B. Renault seine Autos nur dann nach Deutschland exportieren d\u00fcrfte, wenn sie in Deutschland genau so viel kosten wie ein Volkswagen. Und was sollen wir von \u0160koda halten? Arbeiter in Mlad\u00e1 Boleslav verdienen weniger als ihre Kollegen, die Audis oder Citro\u00ebns montieren. Ist das auch Sozialdumping? In der Logik der gewerkschaftlichen Argumentation zur Dienstleistungsrichtlinie sind Forderungen nach Strafz\u00f6llen auf Industrieprodukte aus Mitgliedstaaten mit niedrigerem Lohnniveau nur eine Frage der Zeit. Nichts anderes sind \u00fcbrigens, systematisch betrachtet, Forderungen an die neuen Mitgliedstaaten, ihre Unternehmenssteuern zu erh\u00f6hen.\nLissabon ist kein Selbstzweck, der Binnenmarkt ist kein Selbstzweck. Europa braucht gerade in seinem kontinentalen Kern neues Wachstum, mehr Wachstum, um den Millionen von Arbeitslosen eine neue Perspektive zu verschaffen. Das ist eine politische, soziale und letztendlich eine moralische Verpflichtung. Wer den Binnenmarkt in Gefahr bringt, vers\u00fcndigt sich an den Arbeitslosen Europas. Ihnen sind wir verpflichtet, f\u00fcr sie, die Schw\u00e4chsten unserer Gesellschaft, m\u00fcssen wir Lissabon zum Erfolg f\u00fchren. Das gilt auch f\u00fcr die \u00c4lteren. Die Entschlie\u00dfung des Parlaments betont die Bedeutung der demographischen Entwicklung; auch die Alten von heute und morgen bed\u00fcrfen unserer Aufmerksamkeit. Wir brauchen Wachstum, um unsere Sozialsysteme zu stabilisieren. Mit Umverteilung allein ist es eben nicht getan.

I have colleagues, whom you know and who are very skilled in that area.\nI should like to talk to you about the Commission\u2019s role in the Lisbon Strategy. On many occasions, you have rightly emphasised the fact that, in order for this strategy to succeed, broad popular support is required, as is the proper involvement of all the relevant players, including the national parliaments. With this in mind, the Commission needs, I believe, to send out two clear messages.\nThe first consists in saying that the Lisbon Strategy is not synonymous with unbridled competition between the Member States. Instead, we champion a model of cooperation and solidarity between the Member States.\nThe second message consists in saying that, in a European Union of 25 Member States, there can be no first and second class citizens or workers.\nI shall now give you three practical examples, in connection with which I should expect you to communicate a more proactive stance. Firstly, the free movement of workers. You have referred to this and published a report \u2013 which is all very commendable - and you are very pleased that a number of nations have fallen in with the line taken by the Commission. I should expect both the President of the Commission and the College of Commissioners to act in the interests of the European Union by politely telling those states that do not wish to fall in with the Commission or that are reticent about doing so that they are going down the wrong road.\nI turn now to my second example. On the subject of the Services Directive, Parliament rejected the country of origin principle (or COP). What was the problem with this principle? It was an unwillingness to organise the single market by having insufficiently harmonised national rules compete against each other. In order to reassure workers, you should now state clearly that Portuguese, Germans and Slovaks working on a building site in Poland must receive the same salaries, and vice versa. In other words, the Posting of Workers Directive must be strengthened, and it is your prerogative to do that.\nNow for my third example. When it comes to the issue of taxation development in Europe, the Commission has made progress on the matter of harmonising the tax base within the framework of business taxation. In 2007-2008, you are to lodge a report on the European Union\u2019s budget and future resources. You should have the political will and the courage to say \u2013 and this is a matter broached by other Members \u2013 that it is unacceptable for the budget to be reduced to the point where the budget envisaged for young students or young workers is cut by a third.\nIn other words, Mr\u00a0Barroso, I expect you, in implementing the Lisbon Strategy, not merely to take refuge behind the Member States, even if they have an important role to play. I expect you, instead, to go beyond your role of honest broker and, because you have a monopoly on legislative initiatives, genuinely to find the strength to champion European interests, which are threatened by the tendency for nations increasingly to withdraw into themselves.", "lang": "FR", "original": "Pierre Jonckheer (Verts/ALE). - Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident du Conseil, Monsieur Barroso, Monsieur Verheugen, je suis \u00e9cologiste mais je ne vais pas vous parler d\u2019\u00e9nergie. J\u2019ai des coll\u00e8gues, que vous connaissez, tr\u00e8s comp\u00e9tents sur le sujet.\nJe voudrais vous parler du r\u00f4le de la Commission dans la strat\u00e9gie de Lisbonne. Vous avez insist\u00e9, \u00e0 de nombreuses reprises et \u00e0 juste titre, sur le fait que, pour que cette strat\u00e9gie r\u00e9ussisse, il faut une large adh\u00e9sion populaire et il faut que les parlements nationaux et tous les acteurs soient correctement impliqu\u00e9s. Je crois qu\u2019il convient, \u00e0 cette fin, que la Commission envoie deux messages clairs.\nLe premier message consiste \u00e0 dire que la strat\u00e9gie de Lisbonne n\u2019est pas synonyme de concurrence \u00e9chevel\u00e9e entre les \u00c9tats membres. Nous d\u00e9fendons au contraire un mod\u00e8le de coop\u00e9ration et de solidarit\u00e9 entre les \u00c9tats membres.\nLe deuxi\u00e8me message consiste \u00e0 dire que, dans une Union europ\u00e9enne de vingt-cinq \u00c9tats membres, il ne peut pas y avoir des citoyens ou des travailleurs de premi\u00e8re et de deuxi\u00e8me cat\u00e9gories.\nJe vous donne \u00e0 pr\u00e9sent trois exemples concrets, sur lesquels j\u2019attendrais de votre part un message plus offensif. Premier exemple, la libre circulation des travailleurs. Vous y avez fait allusion, vous avez publi\u00e9 un rapport -\u00a0qui est tr\u00e8s bien\u00a0- et vous vous f\u00e9licitez de ce que certains \u00c9tats nationaux s\u2019alignent sur la Commission. J\u2019attendrais du pr\u00e9sident de la Commission et du coll\u00e8ge que, dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne, ils disent aux \u00c9tats qui ne veulent pas la suivre ou qui sont r\u00e9ticents: Messieurs, vous faites fausse route.\nDeuxi\u00e8me exemple, concernant la directive sur les services, le Parlement a rejet\u00e9 le principe du pays d\u2019origine, le PPO. Quel \u00e9tait le probl\u00e8me avec ce principe? C\u2019est qu\u2019on ne voulait pas organiser le march\u00e9 unique sur une mise en concurrence des r\u00e8gles nationales sans harmonisation suffisante. Vous devriez maintenant, pour rassurer les travailleurs, dire clairement ceci: le Portugais, l\u2019Allemand et le Slovaque qui travaillent sur un chantier en Pologne doivent avoir le m\u00eame salaire, et inversement.

I believe that currently a major advance would be to succeed in reducing by at least half those efforts which are expended on avoiding the Lisbon tasks. The most recent glaring example is the Services Directive, which had been intended to impart vital momentum to liberalising the internal market and increasing competitiveness, and also served as one of the foundation stones of the Lisbon Strategy. The European Parliament\u2019s compromise text will be able to contribute little to energising the common market, at least not while the Lisbon Strategy is still in operation. Similarly, in other spheres we increasingly find any changes and reforms being met by increasing social and political counter-action. Enormous energy is expended on preserving the existing situation and restricting changes and reforms, but in fact reforms to the European Union\u2019s internal market and the intensification of its integration are the main steps that could bring about an environment conducive to implementation of the Lisbon Strategy.\nLittle has so far been achieved to provide coordinated financial support for the Lisbon tasks. During the passionate process of debating the financial framework, the representatives of the Member States\u2019 governments did not have strategic considerations in mind, and the financial framework demonstrates only a very weak connection with the Lisbon tasks. Similarly, little has been done to coordinate the use of the Structural Funds with the Lisbon priorities.

This is now also being corroborated by various Wallonian politicians and prominent economists.\nNow, along comes Mrs Danuta H\u00fcbner, European Commissioner for Regional Policy, claiming that Wallonia manages to use the structural funds effectively and that the Wallonian projects are typical of the so-called remarkable structural changes that take place in that region.

We have, in particular, again made it clear that our ability to realise the other main objectives of the Lisbon Strategy in the way we want to is conditional upon growth and employment.\nThis House has also played its part in setting priorities, three of which are mentioned in our resolution, namely population change, energy policy and innovation.\nMy only complaint is about something that many speakers have already mentioned. The strategic approach is not our main problem; the strategic approach is the right one. Our problem is what happens at the end. To put it in quite practical and quite blunt terms, what I see as the most negative aspect is what we always see happening when the European Council gets its hands on this issue: it decides on a good and substantially sound strategy, presents it at a press conference, and it ends up being written about. The following day, or perhaps a couple of days later, the finance ministers turn up and take back what the European Council had resolved on. That is a fundamental strategic problem, and I have no idea how we are to get on top of it; it plays a considerable part in fostering the perception held by some members of the European public that European policy is dishonest and to increasing public despair with Europe. What must be spelled out at this summit is that we cannot apply double standards; on the contrary, policy as actually implemented must reflect the strategic guidelines.\nThe last issue I would like to address is that of how the impact of laws is to be assessed \u2013 something also mentioned in our resolution. We would like to point out that we expect the impact assessment to include an independent factor, thus ensuring that the result really is neutral.

Zun\u00e4chst m\u00f6chte ich die Gelegenheit nutzen, mich bei meinem Ko-Berichterstatter Robert Goebbels ganz herzlich f\u00fcr die gute Zusammenarbeit in der Lenkungsgruppe zu bedanken. Wir haben es geschafft, in der Lenkungsgruppe einen Entwurf f\u00fcr das Plenum und f\u00fcr die Konferenz der Pr\u00e4sidenten zustande zu bringen, der die logische Fortschreibung dessen ist, was wir im vergangenen Jahr, als es um die Halbzeitbilanz gegangen ist, hier auch zustande gebracht haben.\nNach wie vor unterst\u00fctzt das Parlament vom Grundsatz her die Strategie der Kommission. Insbesondere haben wir wiederholt deutlich gemacht, dass Wachstum und Besch\u00e4ftigung die Voraussetzungen daf\u00fcr sind, dass wir die anderen Hauptziele der Lissabon-Strategie auch so verwirklichen k\u00f6nnen, wie wir dies wollen.\nDas Parlament hat sich auch an der Schwerpunktsetzung beteiligt. Wir haben drei Schwerpunkte in unserer Entschlie\u00dfung: das Thema der Demographie, der Energiepolitik und der Innovation.\nIch will hier nur das beklagen, was viele Vorredner schon angesprochen haben. Das Hauptproblem, das wir haben, ist nicht der strategische Ansatz. Der strategische Ansatz stimmt. Unser Problem ist die Ausf\u00fchrung am Ende. Ganz praktisch und ganz deutlich: Das f\u00fcr mich negativste Beispiel erleben wir immer, wenn der Europ\u00e4ische Rat mit diesem Thema umgeht. Er beschlie\u00dft dann eine gute Strategie, gute Inhalte, macht anschlie\u00dfend eine Pressekonferenz, tr\u00e4gt dies vor, und das Ergebnis ist, dass dar\u00fcber berichtet wird. Am Tag darauf bzw. wenige Tage sp\u00e4ter im Ecofin-Rat kommen die Finanzminister und kassieren das wieder ein, was im Europ\u00e4ischen Rat beschlossen worden ist. Das ist ein strategisches Grundproblem und ich wei\u00df auch nicht, wie wir damit fertig werden k\u00f6nnen. Das tr\u00e4gt wesentlich dazu bei, dass die europ\u00e4ische Politik bei den B\u00fcrgern zum Teil als unehrlich wahrgenommen wird und die B\u00fcrger zunehmend an Europa verzweifeln. Auf diesem Gipfel muss deutlich werden, dass man nicht mit zweierlei Ma\u00df messen kann, sondern dass man die strategischen Vorgaben auch in der konkreten Politik umsetzen muss.\nAls letzten Punkt m\u00f6chte ich die Frage der Gesetzesfolgenabsch\u00e4tzung ansprechen, die wir auch in der Entschlie\u00dfung haben. Wir m\u00f6chten ausdr\u00fccklich darauf hinweisen, dass wir erwarten, dass ein unabh\u00e4ngiger Faktor in die Gesetzesfolgenabsch\u00e4tzung mit aufgenommen wird, damit wir wirklich ein neutrales Ergebnis bekommen.

The strategy is now better known and has been debated in the Member States, and the national reform programmes have been adopted. That is progress, but it is just about the only progress there has been.\nOtherwise, Mr\u00a0Winkler was very bold in stating just now that the Lisbon Strategy had been relaunched. In fact, it is somewhat bogged down. It is, as Mr\u00a0Schulz said, held back by a tiny financial perspective and by anaemic growth within the eurozone, as well as by a flagrant lack of investment \u2013 both at European and Member State level \u2013 in the universities, research and innovation and lifelong learning. In the same way, we are struggling to complete the trans-European networks, and renewable energy sources and biotechnologies are still the poor relations where our investment and research efforts are concerned.\nLet us move up a gear, you said, Mr\u00a0Barroso. Getting into first gear would be a start, I am inclined to reply. If the Lisbon Strategy is to be a success, it needs resources, a coherent financial perspective with defined priorities, investment on the part of each Member State and a macroeconomic framework that genuinely supports growth.\nAs you said, Mr\u00a0President, there is also, however, a need for people to take the Lisbon Strategy to heart. If the growth strategy defined by the European Union is to succeed, it needs to be supported. That is why we should be doubly mistaken to give up the social dimension of this strategy and let ourselves be taken down the road of all-out liberalisation, precarious employment, enfeebled social rights and undermined public services. To do so would be to weaken the bases of the EU\u2019s future competitiveness and to turn away from a Europe of excellence. It would also be to turn Europeans off the European Union and its policies.\nThe social dimension is not inimical to competitiveness. As we have often mentioned in this debate, the Nordic countries have been able to implement reforms successfully because they have negotiated them and arranged for them to be accompanied both by collective investment in research and innovation and by a new economic flexibility and significant compensation for workers in terms of social benefits, lifelong learning and protection of rights. However, all this presupposes that a high level both of tax deductions and of social redistribution will be maintained. In the same way, Germany has come up with all the aces where exports are concerned and, in common with other European Union countries, has demonstrated that, even with high salary costs and a system of social protection that is among the most efficient in Europe and among the most extensive in the world, it can remain competitive internationally.\nLet us, then, stop invoking global competition as a way of denigrating the European social model. Let us invoke it with a view to investing more in Europe\u2019s assets, in human capital and in research and innovation.\nThe route to renewed growth is now basically via consumer confidence, an increase in internal demand, a boost to purchasing power and a fairer distribution of income and added value between shareholders and salaried employees.\nIn conclusion, Mr\u00a0Winkler and Mr\u00a0Barroso, I should like to say that the European Council will be judged on two counts: on the one hand, the lessons it will draw from Parliament\u2019s vote on the \u2018Services\u2019 Directive \u2013 there must, emphatically, be no return to Bolkestein \u2013 and, on the other hand, freedom of movement for workers from the new Member States within the European Union. It is time to grant them that basic freedom.\n(Applause)", "lang": "FR", "original": "Harlem D\u00e9sir (PSE). - Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, 2005 a \u00e9t\u00e9 la premi\u00e8re ann\u00e9e de mise en \u0153uvre de la strat\u00e9gie de Lisbonne r\u00e9vis\u00e9e.

This is a fundamental precondition that we solemnly promised to achieve by approving resolution 884-2004 here in Parliament one year ago, making a commitment to complete the trans-European transport network as rapidly as possible by 2020.\nUnfortunately, there is no trace of this goal in the Commission\u2019s statement \u2013 contrary to the initial proposal \u2013 or of what happened last year when they made a sober reflection and guided us in that direction, also urging the Member States to do the same. If we also add the Council's proposals for a drastic cut in funding for that sector, making achievement of the goal virtually out of the question, or at least delaying it enormously, we are in a situation of red alert.\nIn any event, I view the intervention of Parliament as an attempt to stiffen its resolve and an invitation to all the parties involved to ensure that the trans-European transport network actually sees the light of day.\nMy heartfelt appeal today is to avoid a disastrous political error: a true political error since, after resolution 884, intellectual, political and financial energy was unleashed in Europe, with enormous expectation surrounding the idea of continuing the TEN project. There is no corner of Europe in which the TEN is not being discussed. Today, however, it is one of the items not included \u2013 and therefore inadequately supported \u2013 in that Plan D that is intended to bridge the interest gap between the European Union and its citizens.\nIf we fail to keep our promises or respond to those expectations, the results will be much more far-reaching and serious than those that we are seeking to achieve in the attempt to construct the European project. I hope this idea is not approved and that we are able to avoid the disastrous effects that a possible interruption of the project would have on the expectations of many European citizens.", "lang": "IT", "original": "Paolo Costa (ALDE). \u2013 Signor Presidente, signor Presidente della Commissione, signor Presidente del Consiglio, onorevoli colleghi, ritengo positivo che l\u2019Unione europea usi il suo peso per far s\u00ec che il tutto valga pi\u00f9 della somma delle parti potenziando ricerca e sviluppo, per liberare il potenziale delle imprese, per favorire l\u2019allargamento e il miglior utilizzo della qualit\u00e0 della forza lavoro, per interventi tesi ad assicurare l\u2019energia, ma tutto questo \u00e8 subordinato a una premessa: il valore aggiunto europeo si esprime pienamente solo se pu\u00f2 essere il frutto del lavoro di una societ\u00e0 e di un\u2019economia europea veramente unificata, se i risultati sono raggiunti attraverso il core business dell\u2019Unione europea.\nLa costituzione del mercato unico, di una Comunit\u00e0 unificata socialmente e politicamente proprio nella valorizzazione della ricchezza delle sue identit\u00e0 culturali, questo \u00e8 un fattore da sottolineare con forza: non vi \u00e8 mercato unico, non vi \u00e8 societ\u00e0 europea capace di esprimere tutto il suo potenziale senza integrazione fisica dell\u2019Europa, senza infrastrutture e servizi di trasporto che garantiscano mobilit\u00e0 e accessibilit\u00e0 da ogni punto \u201ca\u201d ad ogni punto \u201cb\u201d dell\u2019Unione stessa.\nNon si guardi a questo obiettivo come a un obiettivo quasi desueto davanti alle nuove cose che dobbiamo affrontare, \u00e8 una premessa essenziale: non vi \u00e8 ricerca sviluppata senza possibilit\u00e0 di contatti faccia a faccia; non vi \u00e8 potenziale di imprese effettivo se i mercati non sono integrati.

Non c\u2019\u00e8 luogo d\u2019Europa nel quale non si discuta delle TEN. Le TEN costituiscono oggi, di fatto, uno dei capitoli non previsti e quindi non adeguatamente sostenuti di quel piano D che dovrebbe colmare il gap di interesse tra l\u2019Unione europea e i suoi cittadini.\nSe non manteniamo le promesse, se non rispondiamo a queste aspettative, inneschiamo effetti enormemente pi\u00f9 pesanti e gravi di quelli, invece, che cerchiamo di raggiungere nel tentativo di mettere assieme il progetto europeo.

The expectations of our young people will have to be taken into account, and there will be a duty to recognise our ever growing number of older people. All this presupposes the adaptation of our infrastructures. Our society is undergoing huge changes, and that is what worries people. We need, therefore, to help them out by anticipating the difficulties of the next few decades.\nThe all-encompassing welfare state of the Eighties is no longer the answer.

It is a confidence that would spontaneously give a boost to growth, as well as to the birth rate, which is a good barometer of the state of our society. It is a confidence that would lead to immigration being considered a great opportunity and that, instead of hampering private initiative, would free it up and encourage and support it. This restored confidence would enable us to train our researchers better and then to keep hold of them. It is in the interests of a more successfully knowledge-based society that we should do these things, although, in view of what is happening with Erasmus, there is genuine reason to be worried about the prospects for such a society. Finally, this is a Europe that would be without taboos and that would therefore dare to talk in terms of nuclear power and of independence where energy sources are concerned. I could give many more examples of what it could do.\nWhat is the point of speeches, however, without an appropriate budget? We are now told, Mr\u00a0Barroso, that a choice will have to be made between the trans-European networks and Galileo. Is that possible? No, it is not. Galileo is needed, and the internal market needs to be completed by means of better communications.

If the national reform plans submitted by governments are anything like those provided by the United Kingdom Government, then heaven help us.\nThe debate on protectionism goes to the heart of the debate on future economic development. There is no room for the policies we have seen of late. The time for diplomatic niceties has passed. We must allow the voice of small and medium-sized businesses to be heard.\nOn the Services Directive, the compromise package agreed by Parliament must be improved upon by governments. We have made progress, but not enough. The Council should get its act together on the Doha Round and work harder towards world trade agreements.\nI am afraid that at the moment the jury is out.

After all, the European public are still being promised more growth and more jobs, but let us not pull the wool over each other\u2019s eyes, for paper can wait. When after the summit, next week, the Heads of Government return to their capitals, they must also take with them ownership of Lisbon, for it is the Member States, in tandem with the social partners, national and regional politicians, who will ultimately bring about an increase in employment.\nThe message to the Member States is both simple and clear. The internal market must become a reality, come what may. More should be done in the area of research and development; innovation must be supported and education and training must be organised on a more efficient and better-quality footing. The Lisbon Strategy also has a social dimension, though. We will not become competitive if we reduce our principles and values on solidarity with the weakest, our citizens\u2019 own responsibility, social justice or wages to such a level that we start to compete with our Asian competitors. That is not the European answer that will inspire public confidence.\nReforms are necessary, though. Demographic change, in the shape of an ageing population and a declining birth rate, must be addressed. We should summon up the nerve to scrutinise the ways in which social security systems are funded, for the demographic reality is drawing nearer at ever-increasing speed. There is no point in pondering an entrepreneur-friendly climate or lifelong learning, if we fail to deliver. There is work to be done.\nWe have arranged the European structural programmes in such a way as to ensure that three quarters, or 55\u00a0billion, will contribute to the Lisbon objectives, and if the funds for those programmes are lacking, or if the Member States are not prepared to pay up, then I have to conclude that growth and employment in line with Lisbon will not be achieved.\nAs far as the ageing population and the declining numbers of young people are concerned, we will need to adjust social security and employment policy in such a way that active young people and fit elderly people can make their contributions to society in the near future, to prosperity and happiness for our citizens.", "lang": "NL", "original": "Ria Oomen-Ruijten (PPE-DE). - Voorzitter, dit debat gaat over de Voorjaarstop en wij hebben een mooie resolutie met prachtige aanbevelingen. De Europese burger is immers beloofd dat er meer groei zou zijn en dat er meer banen zouden komen, maar laten we elkaar geen zand in de ogen strooien, papier is geduldig. Wanneer na de top, komende week, de regeringsleiders weer naar hun hoofdsteden gaan, dan moeten ze ook het ownership van Lissabon meenemen, want het zijn de lidstaten die uitmaken met de sociale partners, met de politici, nationaal en lokaal, dat er ook meer groei aan banen bereikt wordt.\nDe boodschap aan de lidstaten is eenvoudig en helder. De interne markt moet echt verwezenlijkt worden. Er moet meer gebeuren aan onderzoek en ontwikkeling, innovatie moet worden ondersteund en scholing en opleiding moet effici\u00ebnter en meer op kwaliteit worden gericht. Voorzitter, de Lissabon-strategie heeft echter ook een sociale dimensie. We worden niet competitief, wanneer we onze principes en waarden over solidariteit met de zwaksten, de eigen verantwoordelijkheid van onze burgers, de sociale gerechtigheid of de lonen z\u00f3 reduceren dat we op het niveau komen van onze Aziatische concurrenten. Dat is niet de Europese oplossing die onze burgers vertrouwen geeft.\nEr zijn wel hervormingen nodig, de demografische ontwikkeling van verzilvering en ontgroening moet een antwoord krijgen.

The first of these is the completion of the single internal market. It seems that the concept of the four freedoms underpinning the European Union is something that, sadly, often exists only on paper. We took a very important step here last month with the first reading of the Services Directive. I firmly believe that this was a step in the right direction, but I would like to say something about the free movement of persons. The report from the European Commission, which has already been mentioned here, stresses that labour mobility, not only between the new and old Member States, but also within the \u2018old\u2019 EU, is still insufficient. And yet it is precisely this mobility upon which economic growth relies. The second of these issues is the approval of the Financial Perspective.\nLadies and gentlemen, if we do not have the Financial Perspective by the middle of the year, Europe will face a crisis. An economic crisis, a political crisis and also, I fear, a crisis of confidence. I would therefore call on all three institutions to work hard at this issue so that the Financial Perspective will be, so to speak, \u2018home and dry\u2019 by the end of June, or in other words by the end of the Austrian Presidency.", "lang": "CS", "original": "Libor Rou\u010dek (PSE). \u2013 D\u00e1my a p\u00e1nov\u00e9, j\u00e1 bych cht\u011bl dnes zm\u00ednit dva aspekty, kter\u00e9 vid\u00edm jako velmi d\u016fle\u017eit\u00e9 p\u0159i napl\u0148ov\u00e1n\u00ed c\u00edl\u016f Lisabonsk\u00e9 strategie, tzn. r\u016fst a zam\u011bstnanost.

(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although \u2018growth\u2019 and \u2018employment\u2019 are the keywords of the Lisbon Strategy, it seems to me that they need again to be clarified.\nWhen we, in twenty-first century Europe, use the term 'growth', we cannot be talking about any kind of growth other than that which is sustainable, socially defensible and environmentally responsible. Anything else would mean that we had learned nothing from past decades, and I ask that that be taken to heart once and for all. When the Commission talks about growth, it is talking in terms of sustainable growth, which involves environmental innovation, energy efficiency, competition for higher quality rather than for lower social standards, lower environmental standards or lower wages, so I hope that is now clear once and for all.\nWhen we talk about jobs, we are not talking about just any old jobs, for we have come to recognise that the great social question of our time is whether we will, in amidst the storms of globalisation, succeed in making available sufficient well paid and skilled jobs. That is the big issue with which we have to deal. Our concern is not with just any old jobs; what matters is that they should be jobs that will last in times when competition is getting tougher.\nThe consequence of that in our present situation is that certain clear demands must be made of the Member States, which must be told quite firmly that the time for a change of course is now upon us. Now is the time for us to take \u2013 and with all the determination we can muster \u2013 the step into the knowledge-based society. We cannot afford any societies in Europe whose educational policies exclude rather than foster or discriminate against people rather than integrating them. We need an education policy that makes the fullest possible use of this continent\u2019s reserves of education.\nWe cannot afford social policies that, while allowing young women to get a good education, do not thereafter give them the chance to make something of it for lack of any compatibility between family life and working life, and we cannot afford social policies that simply spit older workers out of the production process because it is believed that they are no longer needed. Today, none of these things is a viable proposition any longer, and our strategy makes that abundantly clear.\nWe also affirm that the European single market, a policy that faces up to international competition, is good for growth and employment, and it is for that reason that this Commission does not believe in economic patriotism of any kind whatever. We wish to reiterate that those who want a big European internal market must also accept the fact that businesses are coming into being in order to operate in it without reference to borders.\n(Applause)\nIf there is to be a European market, there must also be European enterprises. The Commission notes with concern the renationalisation of economic thinking in some parts of the European Union and warns against it, for \u2013 as almost all speakers today have said \u2013 the right way is to address Europe\u2019s problems together.\nI also, though, have something to say to European businesses. For years now, we have been pursuing a policy of improving conditions for European businesses, but what we expect of them now, at a time when the biggest of them are doing better than ever before, is that they should be aware of their responsibility for Europe as a business location. Businesses are not only under an obligation to make short-term profits; they also have a responsibility for the site where they make them.\n(Applause)\nIf a company undergoing structural change resorts to making staff redundant, then the primary responsibility for this does not lie with policymakers; on the contrary, we are dealing in such a case with a failure on the part of the business, for businesses can recognise in good time when structural change is going to become necessary and when it has to be set in motion, and we demand of European businesses that they do more to give structural change a positive outcome. Laying staff off is always the worst way to handle it, and it is one to which they must not have recourse.\n(Applause)\nThere is something else we must say to European businesses, however: It is that it is possible to grow by using high business profits to create new products, to develop new technologies and new capacities, rather than only to buy up other businesses.\nI would like to point out \u2013 in the most friendly way possible \u2013 that all our experience with the buying-up of businesses over the past twenty years has shown, in the vast majority of cases, no positive effect on the business or on the economy as a whole. I would prefer it if European companies were to use the huge profits they have made in recent times to invest in new research and production capacities in Europe rather than for funding campaigns to take over other businesses.\nThere is also something that members of parliaments need to do. It has been complained, and quite rightly, that the general public have not been involved in developing the strategy for growth and employment. That is a task for national policy-makers and national parliaments.\nI ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to talk to your counterparts in the national parliaments in the countries from which you come, and get this issue put on the national policy agenda. It is, after all, no part of the Commission\u2019s business to prompt opposition politicians in the Member States to do their jobs and to ensure that this issue is put on the agenda. That is for parliamentarians to do, so I really do urge you to bring your influence to bear here, for only if we succeed in setting in motion a broad political debate in the Member States and their legislatures will we succeed in creating the necessary awareness of the need for a joint effort, not only by policymakers, but also on the part of the public, if our competitiveness is to be unimpaired.\n(Lively applause)", "lang": "EN", "original": "G\u00fcnther Verheugen, Vice-President of the Commission .

We wish to reiterate that those who want a big European internal market must also accept the fact that businesses are coming into being in order to operate in it without reference to borders.\n(Applause)\nIf there is to be a European market, there must also be European enterprises. The Commission notes with concern the renationalisation of economic thinking in some parts of the European Union and warns against it, for \u2013 as almost all speakers today have said \u2013 the right way is to address Europe\u2019s problems together.\nI also, though, have something to say to European businesses. For years now, we have been pursuing a policy of improving conditions for European businesses, but what we expect of them now, at a time when the biggest of them are doing better than ever before, is that they should be aware of their responsibility for Europe as a business location. Businesses are not only under an obligation to make short-term profits; they also have a responsibility for the site where they make them.\n(Applause)\nIf a company undergoing structural change resorts to making staff redundant, then the primary responsibility for this does not lie with policymakers; on the contrary, we are dealing in such a case with a failure on the part of the business, for businesses can recognise in good time when structural change is going to become necessary and when it has to be set in motion, and we demand of European businesses that they do more to give structural change a positive outcome. Laying staff off is always the worst way to handle it, and it is one to which they must not have recourse.\n(Applause)\nThere is something else we must say to European businesses, however: It is that it is possible to grow by using high business profits to create new products, to develop new technologies and new capacities, rather than only to buy up other businesses.\nI would like to point out \u2013 in the most friendly way possible \u2013 that all our experience with the buying-up of businesses over the past twenty years has shown, in the vast majority of cases, no positive effect on the business or on the economy as a whole. I would prefer it if European companies were to use the huge profits they have made in recent times to invest in new research and production capacities in Europe rather than for funding campaigns to take over other businesses.\nThere is also something that members of parliaments need to do. It has been complained, and quite rightly, that the general public have not been involved in developing the strategy for growth and employment. That is a task for national policy-makers and national parliaments.\nI ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to talk to your counterparts in the national parliaments in the countries from which you come, and get this issue put on the national policy agenda. It is, after all, no part of the Commission\u2019s business to prompt opposition politicians in the Member States to do their jobs and to ensure that this issue is put on the agenda. That is for parliamentarians to do, so I really do urge you to bring your influence to bear here, for only if we succeed in setting in motion a broad political debate in the Member States and their legislatures will we succeed in creating the necessary awareness of the need for a joint effort, not only by policymakers, but also on the part of the public, if our competitiveness is to be unimpaired.\n(Lively applause)", "agenda_item": "Preparations for the European Council: the Lisbon Strategy (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060315-ITEM-003", "intervention_id": "3-084", "summary_english": "```json\n{\n  \"headline\": \"Verheugen calls for sustainable growth through knowledge-based society and European solidarity while criticizing business short-termism\",\n  \"issueSum\": \"The speaker addresses the need to clarify the Lisbon Strategy's goals of growth and employment, emphasizing that growth must be sustainable and jobs must be well-paid and skilled.

Debate Information\n\nThis parliamentary debate focused on preparations for the European Council meeting regarding the Lisbon Strategy implementation. The debate featured 62 contributions from various speakers including Council President Hans Winkler, Commission President Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, MEPs from different political groups, and Commissioner G\u00fcnther Verheugen. The discussion centered on Europe's economic competitiveness, employment creation, and the challenges facing the revised Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs.\n\n## 2. Executive Summary\n\n### Core Issues and Challenges\n\nThe debate revealed widespread consensus on key challenges facing the Lisbon Strategy: persistently high unemployment (19.5 million people), insufficient economic growth rates, brain drain to other continents, energy security vulnerabilities, and rising economic protectionism within the EU. Multiple speakers highlighted the gap between ambitious goals and actual implementation, with Brian Crowley noting that \"Look at the 20 leading biotechnology firms in the world. Nineteen are American and one is Swiss \u2013 none is within the European Union.\"\n\n### Positions on Economic Nationalism vs. European Integration\n\nA fundamental division emerged between supporters of deeper European integration and those concerned about economic nationalism. Commission President Barroso strongly opposed protectionism, stating: \"This is not the moment for economic nationalism. It is not by employing nationalist rhetoric that we shall be able to build the Europe of tomorrow.\" Similarly, Graham Watson argued that \"The irony is that this so-called patriotism \u2013 thinly disguised economic nationalism \u2013 will bring as few benefits to the citizens of France, Spain or Poland as it does to the rest of Europe.\"\n\nHowever, some speakers like Francis Wurtz criticized the strategy's liberal reforms, describing it as having \"two incompatible faces\" and arguing that \"the two components are incompatible and the liberal reforms must be defeated for the social progress goals to succeed.\"\n\n### Implementation and Resource Concerns\n\nA major theme was the disconnect between stated goals and adequate resources. Martin Schulz highlighted that \"between your demand and what the Council has decided, there is a gap of 40.82%.\" Robert Goebbels emphasized this point bluntly: \"A strategy without means is like Napoleon without an army: powerless and ultimately useless.\"\n\n### Energy Policy and Security\n\nEnergy security emerged as a critical component, with Barroso declaring: \"It is exactly because energy is strategic that we need a European strategy and not 25 national strategies.\" Jacek Saryusz-Wolski reinforced this, arguing that \"A competitive European economy as set by the Lisbon Agenda cannot be built upon insecure gas and oil deliveries.\"\n\n### Services Directive and Internal Market\n\nThe Services Directive generated significant debate, with most speakers supporting its advancement while ensuring social protections. Hans-Gert Poettering warned against undermining the compromise, stating that \"entrepreneurship means job creation\" and emphasizing the need for \"free exchange of persons, goods, services, and capital\" as prerequisites for EU competitiveness.\n\n### Social Dimension and Gender Equality\n\nSeveral speakers emphasized the importance of maintaining social cohesion. Poul Nyrup Rasmussen cautioned against implementing \"only flexibility without security,\" referencing negative reactions in France. Edite Estrela argued that \"Without women, the Lisbon Strategy will not succeed,\" advocating for stronger gender integration.\n\n### Specific Policy Proposals\n\nKey proposals included:\n- Creating a European Institute of Technology (Barroso, Poettering)\n- Implementing \"flexicurity\" policies balancing flexibility with security (Winkler, Rasmussen)\n- Establishing a European globalization adjustment fund (Barroso)\n- Developing comprehensive energy security policies (multiple speakers)\n- Increasing R&D investment to 3% of GDP by 2010 (Barroso, others)\n\n### Critical Perspectives\n\nSome speakers fundamentally questioned the strategy's approach. John Whittaker argued for abandoning it entirely, stating: \"The economies of the EU do not need a Lisbon Strategy: they need to be left alone to let markets work.\" Ilda Figueiredo called for replacing it with \"a European strategy for solidarity and sustainable development.\"\n\n### Constitutional Treaty Context\n\nThe ongoing constitutional ratification process created additional tensions, with Jens-Peter Bonde arguing that continued ratifications were \"formally illegal\" after French and Dutch rejections, while Council President Winkler defended states' sovereign rights to continue ratification.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe debate revealed broad agreement on the Lisbon Strategy's objectives but significant disagreement on implementation methods, resource allocation, and the balance between competitiveness and social protection. As Commissioner Verheugen concluded, the challenge is ensuring that \"growth must be sustainable and jobs must be well-paid and skilled\" while transitioning to a truly knowledge-based European economy. The urgency for action was emphasized by multiple speakers who called for moving beyond discussion to concrete implementation, with Timothy Kirkhope demanding: \"The time for diplomatic niceties has passed.\"", "src_model": "claude", "model_type": "claude", "model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "structured": true, "incremental": false, "hierarchical": false, "grouped": false, "shuffle": false, "prompt": false, "lang": "original"}
