{"speaker": "Timothy Kirkhope (PPE-DE).", "english": "Timothy Kirkhope (PPE-DE). \u2013 Mr President, the meeting of the Council later this month will provide an opportunity for Member State governments to affirm the vital need for reform to proceed more rapidly than it has before.\nOn two issues I believe that the Council should speak clearly and forcefully in its conclusions. In the light of the Commission document \u2018Time to move up a gear\u2019, launched in January, this is certainly not a time for drivers to now run out of fuel. I am delighted that Mr\u00a0Barroso seems to be running on high-octane fuel and long may that continue, but the rising tide of protectionist rhetoric and protectionist actions by Member State governments is unacceptable. It is extraordinary that the European Union should still have governments wedded to an outdated protectionist mentality and the promotion of economic and industrial patriotism.\nI welcome the Commission\u2019s statements condemning that drift. I welcome the recent comments of the German Economics Minister, who said that we do not need industrial patriotism and said that foreign investors should be welcomed with open arms, not just tolerated. If the national reform plans submitted by governments are anything like those provided by the United Kingdom Government, then heaven help us.\nThe debate on protectionism goes to the heart of the debate on future economic development. There is no room for the policies we have seen of late. The time for diplomatic niceties has passed. We must allow the voice of small and medium-sized businesses to be heard.\nOn the Services Directive, the compromise package agreed by Parliament must be improved upon by governments. We have made progress, but not enough. The Council should get its act together on the Doha Round and work harder towards world trade agreements.\nI am afraid that at the moment the jury is out. I urge the European Council to show the same vigour and determination as Mr Barroso. I urge it to avoid the usual fudge at the meeting later this month and give some real leadership.
