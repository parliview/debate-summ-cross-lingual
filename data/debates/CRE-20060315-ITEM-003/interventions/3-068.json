It cannot be built on differentiated and uneven access to and security of energy supplies. It is contrary to the logic of the single market and competition principles. It is welcome, therefore, that security of energy supply constitutes one of the Presidency\u2019s and Commission\u2019s priorities.\nIt is high time that the Union undertook concrete action in this field. Security of energy supply is crucial for the economic activity and competitiveness of the EU economy as a whole. Energy, as we have witnessed recently, is also sometimes used as a weapon for exerting political influence. Hence, it should also be considered within the context of foreign and security policy of the Union.\nRecent problems with energy supply expose our weakness, vulnerability and dependence on third parties. Therefore it is essential for the EU to develop a true energy security policy. If we treat the internal market and the Lisbon Agenda seriously, we should endow our economic operators and citizens with equal access to and security of energy supplies. Steps taken by the Presidency, and especially the Commission\u2019s Green Paper, are going in the right direction, although they are too modest.\nSolidarity is one of the main principles of European integration; it creates an obligation to assist all those states that are in difficulty. We must extend this principle of solidarity to problems related to energy supply shortages caused by political action. What we need in securing external energy supplies is cooperation and solidarity, not competition between Member States.\nEnergy security also has a financial aspect: the biggest cutbacks in the Financial Perspective, as agreed by the Council, occurred in the field of trans-European energy networks. We have to remedy that situation in the course of budgetary trialogue, otherwise our priorities will remain on paper.\nEnergy security also constitutes one of the cornerstones of the neighbourhood policy. Close cooperation in the energy security field is indispensable and the most effective confidence-building measure, both within the European Union as well as between the Union and its neighbours.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Jacek Emil Saryusz-Wolski (PPE-DE). \u2013 Mr President, a competitive European economy as set by the Lisbon Agenda cannot be built upon insecure gas and oil deliveries.
