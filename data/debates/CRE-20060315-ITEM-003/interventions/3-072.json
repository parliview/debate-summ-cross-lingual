{"speaker": "John Bowis (PPE-DE). \u2013", "english": "John Bowis (PPE-DE). \u2013 Mr President, firstly I would like to thank President Abbas for giving me this unexpected opportunity to contribute to this debate. I thank Lisbon for giving us the Agenda, and the son of Lisbon on the Commission front bench for his leadership of that Agenda. There is nothing more important to Europe than to ensure that the Lisbon Agenda succeeds. That is the way to give our people new hope that Europe will contribute to their futures and that we can cooperate together to give new hope to other parts of the world as well.\nI want to highlight two aspects of the Agenda highlighted in this resolution. The first is the health of the people of Europe, because I believe that is a prerequisite of Lisbon. Without healthy people you do not have a healthy economy. It is important that we look first at some of the health threats that we are facing, including the possibility of a flu pandemic, and at health opportunities such as those now arising from patient mobility, and see these as part of the Agenda.\nAs my colleagues have said, we need to look at the ageing population to ensure that ageing is an opportunity, and not just a burden. We need to see a healthy environment too as a prerequisite for our economy. That too is not a threat. The opportunities for business to innovate and meet the demands of the higher standards that we expect in our environment will stand them in good stead vis-\u00e0-vis the rest of the world. We have the opportunity to lead the world on sustainability, on innovation, on eco-labelling and so forth, and I believe that is a challenge that the Commission must take up with Parliament.\nLastly, let me give credit and pay tribute to the Austrian Presidency for the work it has been doing in both these areas, in relation both to a healthy people and a healthy environment, because that will lead to the healthy economy that Lisbon can bring us all in the very near future.", "lang": "EN", "original": "John Bowis (PPE-DE). \u2013 Mr President, firstly I would like to thank President Abbas for giving me this unexpected opportunity to contribute to this debate.
