You cannot embrace globalisation while abandoning large numbers of our citizens. We need proactive labour markets.\nWe need to take action on the implementation of legislation: too many Member States are not implementing legislation they have agreed to and, frankly, that is a situation which is unacceptable.\nFinally, 13 years after creating the single market, it is time we accepted that there is a European single market which demands European champions, not national champions.\nSo, let us see less of the talk of this summit and instead see many more plans for concrete action from Member States. Deliver, do not talk!", "lang": "EN", "original": "Gary Titley (PSE). \u2013 Mr President, there are three priorities for the spring summit \u2013 action, action, action: action on the fact that over a third of our working-age population is economically inactive, which is a disgrace.
