It is time for action. I shall focus upon that. We all know that we have slightly better economic growth, but 2.2% instead of 2.1% growth a year as an average is not creating enough employment to seriously bring down our unemployment of 19.5 million. I therefore fundamentally agree with President Barroso and the President of the European Council. We need more growth.\nI have two short questions. Number one: investment. President of the Commission, do you envisage that at the forthcoming European Council meeting the governments can get together \u2013 perhaps we do not have the capacity and powers in the Treaty to force them \u2013 to make a sort of intergovernmental agreement to decide to invest in the next two to three years in the goals you have recommended in your papers and recommendations? If you could envisage that, I would be happy because then we will have taken a step towards coordinated investment action.\nSecondly, I was happy to see that the Employment Council took a decision on flexi-security on the basis of the proposals from the Commission. President-in-Office, do you envisage that the conclusions will ensure not only flexibility, but also modern security? In France I see a government which only focuses on flexibility and I have seen the reactions of the young people. That is why it is so necessary that we ensure both. I would like your response and if you could give us that response today it would be very timely and wise.\nIt is time to deliver and I hope that we will all join forces. I will do what I can in the European Socialist Party and I know that my colleague, our group chairman, will do what he can to deliver, because it is now time and people expect us to do that.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Poul Nyrup Rasmussen (PSE). \u2013 Mr President, the chairman of my group, the PSE Group, has spoken about the necessity for action now.
