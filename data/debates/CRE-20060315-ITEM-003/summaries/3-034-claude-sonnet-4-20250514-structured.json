I apologise for interrupting the debate, but before it began Sir Robert Atkins rose on a point of order which you ruled to be out of order because it did not concern the business of the day. He was actually referring to an extremely important issue which is covered by Rule\u00a0166. When the Parliament\u2019s Rules are being disregarded, it is quite in order for a Member to draw that to your attention.\nSir Robert was stating that the British Government may well be acting ultra vires and in breach of Community law as regards a breach of confidence. The Committee concerned has written to you. I ask you whether it is possible for you to give your reply to Sir Robert Atkins before the vote.\nI should like to remind you once again that I am referring to Rule\u00a0166(1) and Rule\u00a0121(2).\nI apologise for this interruption.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Christopher Beazley (PPE-DE). \u2013 Mr President, I rise on a point of order under Rules\u00a0166(1) and 121(2).
