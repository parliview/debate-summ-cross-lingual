{"speaker": "Brian Crowley,", "english": "Brian Crowley, on behalf of the UEN Group . \u2013 Mr President, I should like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Winkler, and President Barroso for their presentations here today.\nHaving looked at and discussed this issue over a number of years, one of the things that strikes me is: what do we really want from the Lisbon Strategy? The core elements and goals are still as valid today as they were when it was first agreed: to make Europe the most dynamic and innovative economy in the world by 2010. Unfortunately what we hear today is everything but the kitchen sink being thrown into what the Lisbon Strategy should be doing. Perhaps we are too ambitious or too wide-ranging with regard to the areas that we want to see included.\nOne of the most important issues \u2013 brought up by all speakers in this House today \u2013 has been the investment in human capital: the issue of training, education and the way in which that leads to further research, and future innovation and development. Let us really look at what is happening in the European Union at the present time. Look at the human demographic situation, where we have an ageing population, a dropping birthrate in most Member States, and where we do not have strategies to respond to that. We need strategies that look to the positive facet of that ageing population, to the experience that they have; but also strategies that are realistic in seeing that people are being denied opportunities to access the new labour market. We need to give them the skills and training that they require to work in the so-called digital economy.\nDespite all the honeyed words we may spout here, the reality of who is best able to deliver on those strategies \u2013 who is best able to give those skills to young workers, students or older people who want to retrain or re-skill \u2013 is that it is not the European Union, but each Member State. That is why we have asked for national plans with clear targets that will guarantee the return of the investment.\nWhen we speak about the European employment strategy, social cohesion and social partnership, it is vital that people are carried along, but it is also vital that people wake up and see the reality of what is happening with relocation of industry \u2013 as was discussed yesterday \u2013 and the lack of investment in research and development. Look at the 20 leading biotechnology firms in the world. Nineteen are American and one is Swiss \u2013 none is within the European Union.\nIf we want to be realistic about being the most dynamic then we must take tough decisions to reflect that position.\n(Applause)", "lang": "EN", "original": "Brian Crowley, on behalf of the UEN Group . \u2013 Mr President, I should like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Winkler, and President Barroso for their presentations here today.\nHaving looked at and discussed this issue over a number of years, one of the things that strikes me is: what do we really want from the Lisbon Strategy?
