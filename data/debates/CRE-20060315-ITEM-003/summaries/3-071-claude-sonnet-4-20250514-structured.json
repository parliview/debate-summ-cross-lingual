{"speaker": "Libor Rou\u010dek (PSE). \u2013", "english": "Libor Rou\u010dek (PSE). \u2013 (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, today I would like to talk about two of the issues which I regard as highly important to fulfilling the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy, or in other words growth and employment. The first of these is the completion of the single internal market. It seems that the concept of the four freedoms underpinning the European Union is something that, sadly, often exists only on paper. We took a very important step here last month with the first reading of the Services Directive. I firmly believe that this was a step in the right direction, but I would like to say something about the free movement of persons. The report from the European Commission, which has already been mentioned here, stresses that labour mobility, not only between the new and old Member States, but also within the \u2018old\u2019 EU, is still insufficient. And yet it is precisely this mobility upon which economic growth relies. The second of these issues is the approval of the Financial Perspective.\nLadies and gentlemen, if we do not have the Financial Perspective by the middle of the year, Europe will face a crisis. An economic crisis, a political crisis and also, I fear, a crisis of confidence. I would therefore call on all three institutions to work hard at this issue so that the Financial Perspective will be, so to speak, \u2018home and dry\u2019 by the end of June, or in other words by the end of the Austrian Presidency.", "lang": "CS", "original": "Libor Rou\u010dek (PSE). \u2013 D\u00e1my a p\u00e1nov\u00e9, j\u00e1 bych cht\u011bl dnes zm\u00ednit dva aspekty, kter\u00e9 vid\u00edm jako velmi d\u016fle\u017eit\u00e9 p\u0159i napl\u0148ov\u00e1n\u00ed c\u00edl\u016f Lisabonsk\u00e9 strategie, tzn. r\u016fst a zam\u011bstnanost.
