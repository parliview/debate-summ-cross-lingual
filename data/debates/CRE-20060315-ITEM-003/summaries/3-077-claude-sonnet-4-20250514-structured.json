In order to achieve the objectives of growth and job creation, gender mainstreaming in the Lisbon Strategy needs to be enhanced, especially in the broad economic policy guidelines and the employment guidelines. We need to raise the rate of employment among women, develop an active ageing strategy and build a society characterised by lifelong learning.\nThe second point relates to the financial perspective. There is an urgent need for an interinstitutional agreement. There is no time to waste. The Council, the Commission and Parliament must act quickly to reach agreement. The citizens of Europe will not accept any more postponement. The time has come to \u2018Lisbonise\u2019 the EU and adopt a budget that will promote growth and more and better jobs for all, including women.
