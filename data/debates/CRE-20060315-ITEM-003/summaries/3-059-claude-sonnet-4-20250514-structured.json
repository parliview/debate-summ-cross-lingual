As we all know, increasing competitiveness mainly requires an increase in productivity, which in turn threatens jobs. This threat will not materialise if the increase in revenue created by greater productivity is sufficiently high and is not limited to individual countries but also applies to integrated economies such as those of the EU.\nHowever, increased productivity requires not only the implementation of technological advances, but also the relocation of production from locations where it is more expensive to those where it is cheaper. The increase in revenue resulting from these activities will be beneficial to all in the Union, while abandoning the process threatens to result in stagnation and decreased competitiveness, as the world does not stand still. Therefore we must choose either certain stagnation or a risk which could pay off.\nWe should not be afraid of the Lisbon Strategy.
