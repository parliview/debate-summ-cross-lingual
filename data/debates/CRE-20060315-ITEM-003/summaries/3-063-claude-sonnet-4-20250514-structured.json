In my view, it is based on a misunderstanding of the way in which economies \u2013 and, for that matter, human civilisations \u2013 develop in the course of history.\nThere was a period in history \u2013 beginning at the end of the eighteenth century and continuing through the nineteenth - when Europe became the world\u2019s most dynamic knowledge-based region. It began with changes in the United Kingdom, including legislation on economic issues and the abolition of the guild system. Huge and rapid progress was made, which spread incredibly quickly to large parts of the world. Other countries too began to use steam engines and the spinning jenny. That is how development proceeds.\nThe idea that there might today exist unusually wise people who know in detail what measures European countries should take in order to help Europe develop into a dynamic knowledge-based region is quite wrong. It is the countries themselves that try to find their way towards solutions, keeping an eagle eye on each other and copying constructive solutions. That is how development proceeds. To go on as we are doing now will set us thinking in the wrong way. We should occupy ourselves with proper issues in the European Union.", "lang": "SV", "original": "Nils Lundgren (IND/DEM). \u2013 Herr talman!
