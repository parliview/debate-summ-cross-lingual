Such a thankless task is one that he is happy to leave to someone else.\nThe message is modest and inadequate in terms of the objectives, particularly of the intended reduction in unemployment, if we bear in mind just how much unemployment there is and what we originally intended that the Lisbon process should achieve; it is not merely modest and inadequate, but also false, in terms of the means to be applied \u2013 these goals, modest though they are, will not be achieved by structural reforms alone.\nThe EU and the Member States must get their hands on more money.
