Within the European Council itself, we want to pay particular attention to combating youth unemployment. One of our aims is to reduce the number of school drop-outs by 2010 and to ensure that more young people complete secondary education. Combating long-term unemployment must also be at the heart of our efforts.\nFinally, the subject of energy will also play a particularly important role, not only because of the importance of the sector in generating jobs and growth, but also, of course, in the light of recent events. I hope that, in this respect just as on all the other subjects I have mentioned, the European Council will provide an important impetus that will decisively influence the future activities of all the institutions of the European Union.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Hans Winkler, President-in-Office of the Council .
