{"speaker": "Pierre Jonckheer (Verts/ALE). \u2013", "english": "Pierre Jonckheer (Verts/ALE). \u2013 (FR) Mr\u00a0President, Mr\u00a0Winkler, Mr\u00a0Barroso, Mr\u00a0Verheugen, I am an ecologist but I am not going to talk to you about energy. I have colleagues, whom you know and who are very skilled in that area.\nI should like to talk to you about the Commission\u2019s role in the Lisbon Strategy. On many occasions, you have rightly emphasised the fact that, in order for this strategy to succeed, broad popular support is required, as is the proper involvement of all the relevant players, including the national parliaments. With this in mind, the Commission needs, I believe, to send out two clear messages.\nThe first consists in saying that the Lisbon Strategy is not synonymous with unbridled competition between the Member States. Instead, we champion a model of cooperation and solidarity between the Member States.\nThe second message consists in saying that, in a European Union of 25 Member States, there can be no first and second class citizens or workers.\nI shall now give you three practical examples, in connection with which I should expect you to communicate a more proactive stance. Firstly, the free movement of workers. You have referred to this and published a report \u2013 which is all very commendable - and you are very pleased that a number of nations have fallen in with the line taken by the Commission. I should expect both the President of the Commission and the College of Commissioners to act in the interests of the European Union by politely telling those states that do not wish to fall in with the Commission or that are reticent about doing so that they are going down the wrong road.\nI turn now to my second example. On the subject of the Services Directive, Parliament rejected the country of origin principle (or COP). What was the problem with this principle? It was an unwillingness to organise the single market by having insufficiently harmonised national rules compete against each other. In order to reassure workers, you should now state clearly that Portuguese, Germans and Slovaks working on a building site in Poland must receive the same salaries, and vice versa. In other words, the Posting of Workers Directive must be strengthened, and it is your prerogative to do that.\nNow for my third example. When it comes to the issue of taxation development in Europe, the Commission has made progress on the matter of harmonising the tax base within the framework of business taxation. In 2007-2008, you are to lodge a report on the European Union\u2019s budget and future resources. You should have the political will and the courage to say \u2013 and this is a matter broached by other Members \u2013 that it is unacceptable for the budget to be reduced to the point where the budget envisaged for young students or young workers is cut by a third.\nIn other words, Mr\u00a0Barroso, I expect you, in implementing the Lisbon Strategy, not merely to take refuge behind the Member States, even if they have an important role to play. I expect you, instead, to go beyond your role of honest broker and, because you have a monopoly on legislative initiatives, genuinely to find the strength to champion European interests, which are threatened by the tendency for nations increasingly to withdraw into themselves.", "lang": "FR", "original": "Pierre Jonckheer (Verts/ALE). - Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident du Conseil, Monsieur Barroso, Monsieur Verheugen, je suis \u00e9cologiste mais je ne vais pas vous parler d\u2019\u00e9nergie. J\u2019ai des coll\u00e8gues, que vous connaissez, tr\u00e8s comp\u00e9tents sur le sujet.\nJe voudrais vous parler du r\u00f4le de la Commission dans la strat\u00e9gie de Lisbonne. Vous avez insist\u00e9, \u00e0 de nombreuses reprises et \u00e0 juste titre, sur le fait que, pour que cette strat\u00e9gie r\u00e9ussisse, il faut une large adh\u00e9sion populaire et il faut que les parlements nationaux et tous les acteurs soient correctement impliqu\u00e9s. Je crois qu\u2019il convient, \u00e0 cette fin, que la Commission envoie deux messages clairs.\nLe premier message consiste \u00e0 dire que la strat\u00e9gie de Lisbonne n\u2019est pas synonyme de concurrence \u00e9chevel\u00e9e entre les \u00c9tats membres. Nous d\u00e9fendons au contraire un mod\u00e8le de coop\u00e9ration et de solidarit\u00e9 entre les \u00c9tats membres.\nLe deuxi\u00e8me message consiste \u00e0 dire que, dans une Union europ\u00e9enne de vingt-cinq \u00c9tats membres, il ne peut pas y avoir des citoyens ou des travailleurs de premi\u00e8re et de deuxi\u00e8me cat\u00e9gories.\nJe vous donne \u00e0 pr\u00e9sent trois exemples concrets, sur lesquels j\u2019attendrais de votre part un message plus offensif. Premier exemple, la libre circulation des travailleurs. Vous y avez fait allusion, vous avez publi\u00e9 un rapport -\u00a0qui est tr\u00e8s bien\u00a0- et vous vous f\u00e9licitez de ce que certains \u00c9tats nationaux s\u2019alignent sur la Commission. J\u2019attendrais du pr\u00e9sident de la Commission et du coll\u00e8ge que, dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne, ils disent aux \u00c9tats qui ne veulent pas la suivre ou qui sont r\u00e9ticents: Messieurs, vous faites fausse route.\nDeuxi\u00e8me exemple, concernant la directive sur les services, le Parlement a rejet\u00e9 le principe du pays d\u2019origine, le PPO. Quel \u00e9tait le probl\u00e8me avec ce principe? C\u2019est qu\u2019on ne voulait pas organiser le march\u00e9 unique sur une mise en concurrence des r\u00e8gles nationales sans harmonisation suffisante. Vous devriez maintenant, pour rassurer les travailleurs, dire clairement ceci: le Portugais, l\u2019Allemand et le Slovaque qui travaillent sur un chantier en Pologne doivent avoir le m\u00eame salaire, et inversement. Autrement dit, la directive sur le d\u00e9tachement des travailleurs doit \u00eatre renforc\u00e9e et vous avez les pr\u00e9rogatives pour le faire.\nTroisi\u00e8me exemple, concernant la question de l\u2019\u00e9volution de la fiscalit\u00e9 en Europe, la Commission a progress\u00e9 sur le dossier de l\u2019harmonisation de la base imposable dans le cadre de la fiscalit\u00e9 des entreprises. Vous devez, en 2007-2008, d\u00e9poser un rapport sur le budget et les ressources futurs de l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne. Ayez la volont\u00e9 politique et le courage de dire ceci: il n\u2019est pas acceptable -\u00a0d\u2019autres coll\u00e8gues en ont parl\u00e9\u00a0- que le budget soit r\u00e9duit au point de devoir ramener \u00e0 deux tiers le budget pr\u00e9vu pour les jeunes \u00e9tudiants ou les jeunes travailleurs.\nEn d\u2019autres termes, Monsieur Barroso, j\u2019attends, pour la mise en \u0153uvre de la strat\u00e9gie de Lisbonne, que vous ne vous r\u00e9fugiez pas seulement derri\u00e8res les \u00c9tats membres, m\u00eame s\u2019ils ont un r\u00f4le important \u00e0 jouer, mais que vous d\u00e9passiez votre r\u00f4le d\u2019 honest broker , d\u2019interm\u00e9diaire impartial, et que vous trouviez r\u00e9ellement, parce que vous avez le monopole de l\u2019initiative l\u00e9gislative, la force de d\u00e9fendre l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat europ\u00e9en qui est menac\u00e9 par la mont\u00e9e des replis nationaux.", "agenda_item": "Preparations for the European Council: the Lisbon Strategy (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060315-ITEM-003", "intervention_id": "3-048", "summary_english": "{\"headline\": \"Commission Must Champion European Solidarity Over Member State Competition in Lisbon Strategy Implementation\", \"issueSum\": \"The speaker raises concerns about the Commission's role in implementing the Lisbon Strategy, specifically addressing three key areas: restrictions on free movement of workers by some member states, inadequate worker protections under the Services Directive following rejection of the country of origin principle, and insufficient political courage regarding EU budget and taxation harmonization.\", \"positionSum\": \"The speaker supports the Lisbon Strategy but argues it should emphasize cooperation and solidarity between member states rather than unbridled competition.
