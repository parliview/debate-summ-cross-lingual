The majority of the Member States are slowing down the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy for totally selfish reasons, and for short-sighted ones too. Every week, for example, we lag badly behind the United States of America and Japan in terms of investment in information and communications technology. At the same time, China and India are competing with us ever more fiercely. We are completely stuck, and we are going nowhere.\nThe Nordic countries, however, have maintained peak levels of competitiveness, the welfare state and a large knowledge base. That has happened now. I would ask Mr\u00a0Barroso, President of the European Commission, whether it is possible that you have the sort of southern temperament to pass this example on to those who are still afraid of the bold solutions which we adopted a long time ago. It has not turned us upside down, and not even the cold winter has made us change direction.
