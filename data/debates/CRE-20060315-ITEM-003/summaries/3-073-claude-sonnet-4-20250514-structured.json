{"speaker": "Edit Herczog (PSE). \u2013", "english": "Edit Herczog (PSE). \u2013 (HU) Mr President, on 15 March, Hungary remembers the fight for freedom and revolution of 1848. Looking back, we can say that the lasting results of the revolution have been the change in the economic system, the freedom of people and the continuing competitiveness of the country.\nToday, competition is no longer between nation-states, but between continents, at a global level. Therefore, lasting competitiveness, too, must be created at this level. The European Union needs a serious change in its economic philosophy. We must, at last, switch from the outdated, unproductive competition between Member States to a European internal market ensuring the highest level of freedom and human dignity to its citizens.\nThe Lisbon Strategy is not only a five-ten year plan, but the foundation of our competitiveness and survival for the next 100-150 years. In 1848, politicians understood the message of the times and spearheaded the change. I ask the Council, the Commission, Parliament and the Prime Ministers preparing for the spring summit to finally understand and implement the message of the 21st century. This is what we, European citizens, expect of them.", "lang": "HU", "original": "Edit Herczog (PSE). \u2013 Tisztelt Eln\u00f6k \u00dar!
