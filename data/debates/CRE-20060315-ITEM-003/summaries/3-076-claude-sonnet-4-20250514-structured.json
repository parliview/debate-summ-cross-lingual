Those countries that have implemented reforms and changes are coping that much better with globalisation and managing to be that much more competitive. Those that have not introduced reforms are faring less well.\nWhat is remarkable, though, is how little has in actual fact happened at a common European level and the limited degree to which we have given new companies, services and markets more room to expand and products more scope for development. The Commission\u2019s primary and overarching task is to combat the new protectionism we see developing among governments and politicians in Europe. This new protectionism is directed against the new Member States and the world outside where the big future markets exist. However, it is directed against the old Member States, too, in relations between which it is also increasingly to be found.\nIf the Lisbon process is to be managed successfully, the main task is that of combating this protectionism, which contravenes the Treaty and everything that European integration stands for. Europe has fantastic potential, and where we have implemented reforms we have been successful. Look, for example, at the telecommunications market, where we are most successful of all.\nWhat the Commission must do is drive home the importance of safeguarding the free trade that is at the root of Europe\u2019s prosperity. It should be positive about globalisation, but it should, above all, be sure to implement measures leading to more new companies and new jobs. It must be the results that count, and not the objectives. Then, we shall be able to give Europe a new future.", "lang": "SV", "original": "Gunnar H\u00f6kmark (PPE-DE). \u2013 Herr talman! N\u00e4r vi diskuterar Lissabonprocessen kan vi se att man lyckas mer eller mindre bra i olika l\u00e4nder. De l\u00e4nder som genomf\u00f6rt reformer och f\u00f6r\u00e4ndringar klarar b\u00e5de globaliseringen och konkurrenskraften b\u00e4ttre.

Kommissionens \u00f6vergripande uppgift framf\u00f6r andra \u00e4r att bek\u00e4mpa den nya protektionism som vi ser v\u00e4xa fram bland regeringar och politiker i Europa.
