The resolution must not be regarded as extending the time it will take to achieve the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy as it will, for example, give all European Union nationals access to a high-level education and to lifelong learning. I would point out the importance of a European exchange programme for apprentices.\nI should also like to emphasise the role played by small and medium-sized enterprises in achieving the Lisbon objectives. Such enterprises are among the main sources of tomorrow\u2019s jobs. We must therefore provide ourselves with the resources for removing the obstacles that stand in the way of these companies, particularly the smallest ones, and, over and above that, give them resources for innovation. Hence, the importance of an ambitious budget for the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme (CIP).\nAs you will have appreciated, I deplore the lack of a budget to match the ambitions of the Lisbon Strategy and hope that we shall manage to improve the financial perspective with a view to remedying this situation.", "lang": "FR", "original": "Dominique Vlasto (PPE-DE). - Les th\u00e8mes li\u00e9s \u00e0 la comp\u00e9titivit\u00e9 et \u00e0 la croissance ont toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 au c\u0153ur de la strat\u00e9gie de Lisbonne.\nAujourd\u2019hui, et je tiens \u00e0 dire que c\u2019est une excellente chose, la r\u00e9solution sur laquelle nous allons voter introduit la dimension sociale.
