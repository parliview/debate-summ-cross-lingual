Neither of these principles is being implemented in practice, and that certainly does no credit to the EU. It is not acceptable that the EU\u2019s most important law-making body, the Council, still meets behind closed doors when acting as a legislator. I can just imagine what would happen if the national parliament of a Member State closed its doors when starting to make laws \u2013 the parliament would be bound to disapprove of that. In the EU, however, it is still possible to make laws undemocratically.\nGreater transparency would make it easier to monitor the European Parliament, and the national parliaments too, and would greatly improve public debate on questions relating to the EU. Today it is very difficult for national parliaments and the public to follow and monitor the decisions made by their own ministers in the Council. This really is no longer acceptable: one part of democracy is transparency.\nAt present in the EU, people are saying that the Constitutional Treaty should be ratified quickly. I in fact regard it as a lot more important for the EU to promote transparency and for all the EU institutions to do their utmost concerning this, and first and foremost, obviously, the Council. This way, this black hole in democracy could be filled and transparency would be a fact of life in legislation at EU level.", "lang": "FI", "original": "Anneli J\u00e4\u00e4tteenm\u00e4ki (ALDE). \u2013 (FI) Arvoisa puhemies, EU:n perussopimusten mukaan p\u00e4\u00e4t\u00f6kset tulee tehd\u00e4 mahdollisimman avoimesti ja mahdollisimman l\u00e4hell\u00e4 kansalaisia.
