{"speaker": "Jens-Peter Bonde,", "english": "Jens-Peter Bonde, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. \u2013 (DA) Mr\u00a0President, there is a very simple method of implementing openness in the EU: reverse the procedure so that there is open access to all meetings and documents, unless the opposite is decided. That is the way things are here in the European Parliament, and it is something from which the other institutions can learn. Our committee meetings for the purpose of preparing legislation are open. Why cannot the corresponding deliberations in the Council\u2019s 300 half-secret working parties be opened? Our use of experts is a public matter. Why will the Commission not say who are involved in the 3\u00a0000 secret working parties?\nThe proposal to reverse the procedure received 200 of a possible 220 signatures in the Convention. No other proposals gathered so much support: all the elected representatives in the national parliaments, all but one of the Members of the European Parliament and 23 out of 28 governments. The proposal does not even require a change to the Treaty. It can be implemented by means of a simple change to the Rules of Procedure. Both the Commission and the Council can adopt the proposal by a simple majority: 13 out of 25 Commissioners and 13 out of the 25 countries in the Council. Come on now, Mr\u00a0Barroso and Mr\u00a0Sch\u00fcssel, get matters under way so that people might feel respect for the necessary cross-border cooperation.", "lang": "DA", "original": "Jens-Peter Bonde, for IND/DEM-Gruppen . - Hr. formand Der findes en meget enkel metode til at gennemf\u00f8re \u00e5benhed i EU: Vend proceduren, s\u00e5 adgangen til alle m\u00f8der og papirer er \u00e5bne, medmindre man beslutter det modsatte.
