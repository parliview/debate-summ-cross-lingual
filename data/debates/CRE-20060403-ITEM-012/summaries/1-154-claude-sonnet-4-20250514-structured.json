He said that the Commission is an unelected government. Of course, everybody knows perfectly well that it is not a government at all. Would you like it to be elected? Would you like it to be a federal Europe with an elected government? Come on, which way are you facing, Mr\u00a0Knapman? Then he uses this ridiculous word: the Commission \u2018dictates\u2019 laws. It does not dictate anything: it gets its powers from the Council and Parliament. Just tell the truth to the British public \u2013 that is all we ask. I am going to abandon Mr Knapman now.\nThe ALDE Group is totally supportive of these reports and we want more openness. Under the British Presidency we fought very hard to persuade Mr Blair to do something. In his usual way, there were big words and promises but very little action in the Council of Ministers under the British Presidency, which was very sad. We want the Council to legislate in public. It is perfectly clear and simple: only North Korea and Beijing behave like the Council of Ministers in Brussels. That must change if we want the public to understand what is happening in Europe.\nSecondly, we want legal opinions drafted within the framework of a legislative process to be public, not just to parliamentary committees but also to the public, whom we represent.\nI have run out of time. However, we will all vote in favour \u2013 I hope even Mr Knapman.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Bill Newton Dunn (ALDE). \u2013 Mr President, I wish to begin by making a few comments about Mr\u00a0Knapman\u2019s absurd remarks.
