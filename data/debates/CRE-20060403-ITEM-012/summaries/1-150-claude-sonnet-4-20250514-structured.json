{"speaker": "Carl Schlyter (Verts/ALE). \u2013", "english": "Carl Schlyter (Verts/ALE). \u2013 (SV) Mr\u00a0President, I would thank the rapporteurs for their constructive work. I like Mr\u00a0Voggenhuber\u2019s proposal that we refuse to be accessories to an undemocratic piece of decision-making. Where is the Council? Do they have problems keeping awake so late in the day? It is because they lock themselves in their rooms. If they were to open these up, they would obtain enough oxygen to last them until the evening so that they might take part in these debates too. Why do they not open their doors? Do not politicians welcome any chance to appear on television? Why, I wonder, is the Council passing up the opportunity to do so? Like the entire population of Europe, I wonder what they are doing. There is an easy way of remedying the situation: open the doors so that we can see what is happening. I am relying on Mrs\u00a0Wallstr\u00f6m to lead the EU into the twenty-first century and wake the Council from its twentieth century sleep. I feel it is important for us to remind the Council that, if they do now open up their meetings, it must not be in order to get together formally for just an hour and then to take a four-hour working lunch, in which case openness would become a chimera. We are also relying on the Council to eat quickly and to take their decisions openly and over an extended period.", "lang": "SV", "original": "Carl Schlyter (Verts/ALE). \u2013 Herr talman!
