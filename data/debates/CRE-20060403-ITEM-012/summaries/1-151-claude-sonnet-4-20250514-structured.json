{"speaker": "Carlos Coelho (PPE-DE).", "english": "Carlos Coelho (PPE-DE). \u2013 (PT) Mrs Wallstr\u00f6m, ladies and gentlemen, we believe that the right of access to documents is one of the most important rights enjoyed by Europe\u2019s citizens.\nThe EU has made an increasing number of documents available to the public. There have been a number of problems, however, particularly in relation to the inadequate implementation of Regulation (EC) No 1049/01. Accordingly, Parliament has, rightly, repeatedly stressed the need for a review of this regulation, with a view to improving it and strengthening EU legislation in the area of transparency.\nWe have done so because it is crucial to stress the idea of the citizens belonging to and identifying with the European project. For this to happen, there must be a decision-making process based on transparent, open negotiations, and proper cooperation between the institutions, without any unwanted secretiveness. This amended regulation must also form the legal basis for establishing rules, good practices and inter-institutional agreements designed to improve the drafting of legislative texts and to ensure that final legislative texts are accessible.\nI wholeheartedly agree with Mr Cashman, who has once again done an excellent job, when he says that the fact that Parliament does not have a clear legal basis for access to classified EU information runs counter to the democratic principle on which the Union is based.\nIt is also regrettable that the institutions do not have a shared approach on how to manage, share and store various kinds of document. Improvements have undoubtedly been made, but there is still no great coordination between the institutions, especially as regards documents relating to interinstitutional processes. There should also be clear rules on access to administrative documents.\nI shall conclude, Mr President, by turning to an issue that especially affects me as chairman of the temporary committee analysing the CIA flights. I wish to express my regret at the omission of the issue of access to documents that the Member States classify and make available to the Council.", "lang": "PT", "original": "Carlos Coelho (PPE-DE). \u2013 Senhora Vice-Presidente da Comiss\u00e3o, Senhoras e Senhores Deputados, para n\u00f3s, o direito de acesso aos documentos \u00e9 um dos principais direitos dos cidad\u00e3os europeus.\nA Uni\u00e3o Europeia tem colocado \u00e0 disposi\u00e7\u00e3o do p\u00fablico um n\u00famero cada vez maior de documentos, mas t\u00eam sido v\u00e1rios os problemas registados, sobretudo os que est\u00e3o relacionados com a aplica\u00e7\u00e3o inadequada do Regulamento (CE) n\u00ba 1049/2001. Por isso, o Parlamento Europeu tem reiterado, e bem, com insist\u00eancia, a necessidade de rever esse regulamento requerendo uma melhoria e um refor\u00e7o da legisla\u00e7\u00e3o da Uni\u00e3o em mat\u00e9ria de transpar\u00eancia.\nFazemo-lo porque \u00e9 essencial refor\u00e7ar o sentimento de perten\u00e7a e a ades\u00e3o dos cidad\u00e3os ao projecto europeu.
