Transparency also requires that what is communicated is understood, that it is understood by all of the citizens. We must therefore urge all of the institutions that are in favour of the democratic transparency of the Council to do everything within their capacity to guarantee that transparency in all languages.", "lang": "ES", "original": "In\u00e9s Ayala Sender (PSE). \u2013 (ES) Se\u00f1or Presidente, felicito calurosamente al se\u00f1or Hammerstein y a la Comisaria por sus esfuerzos para democratizar definitivamente las reuniones del Consejo, para abrir las puertas de esas reuniones donde se legisla sin que los ciudadanos tengamos toda la informaci\u00f3n necesaria.\nHe de decir que, en mi pa\u00eds, Espa\u00f1a, en el que se vot\u00f3 a favor de la Constituci\u00f3n Europea, ese fue uno de los argumentos m\u00e1s aceptados por los ciudadanos y las ciudadanas: la posibilidad de democratizar las reuniones del Consejo y de acceder a toda esas informaciones.\nEn ese sentido, apoyo, pues, las propuestas del ponente y, de manera especial, en lo que respecta a la publicaci\u00f3n de toda esa informaci\u00f3n, incluido todo lo relativo a las sucesivas Presidencias, en internet y en todas las lenguas oficiales de la Comunidad, evitando restricciones en la comunicaci\u00f3n.\nDe poco servir\u00eda que se publicara toda la informaci\u00f3n, que se abrieran esas puertas, pero solo en dos o tres lenguas, como alguna instituci\u00f3n parece, en este momento, querer sugerir.
