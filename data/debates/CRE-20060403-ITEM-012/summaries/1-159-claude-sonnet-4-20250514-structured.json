Nevertheless, this demand is being met with deaf ears, an autistic response, and even no response at all. There are plenty of words, but no deeds.\nReflecting on Mr Voggenhuber\u2019s proposal, I am wondering whether we really have to go as far as a parliamentary strike in order to achieve a minimum degree of transparency in the European Council? Or are we going to carry on holding these debates every year, every two years, with Parliament expressing a unanimous position, with no response from the European Council, with no firm initiative from the Commission, without the person on the street seeing it?\nIt is all very well that opening up the Councils was approved in October, Commissioner Wallstr\u00f6m, but the person on the street has not seen anything, ministers do not appear on the television debating, there is no visible debate.\nWe must make European political debate visible, we must make the debate in the Council politically exciting, not just the debate in Parliament.
