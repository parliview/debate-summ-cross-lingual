On the one hand, the political leaders of the Member States support Article 1.2 of the Treaty on European Union, and they have signed the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, which states that the Council\u2019s decisions must be taken as transparently, as openly, and as close to the citizens as possible.\nThe reality is very different, however. The Council refuses to open up its legislative meetings to public and media scrutiny. The European Ombudsman is right to say that we are dealing with a case of maladministration, concluding that the Council has not given a significant valid reason not to open up the doors to its discussions.\nIn order to increase the ordinary citizens\u2019 interest in and commitment to the European Union, and in view of the current constitutional crisis, Europe needs to take courageous and imaginative steps to bring European issues closer to everyone. It must start by opening up its doors to public debate; the Council does not want to do so, however. If millions of Europeans were able to watch the ministers on the television openly discussing European issues such as the energy crisis, the services Directive, the retention of personal data or stem cell research, we could awaken much more interest in European issues and we could put an end to the lethargy of millions of Europeans who show very little interest in European affairs. Public opinion is caught up in strictly national debates.\nThis report adopted by the Committee on Petitions fully supports the recommendation of the European Ombudsman, who has taken the view that the principle of transparency should be applied not just to the discussions of the Council, but to all cases in which the European Parliament is involved, including consultations and issues relating to individual rights and freedoms and those included in the third pillar.\nIn October, the European Ombudsman published a report calling upon the Council to review its refusal to meet publicly when taking decisions of a legislative nature. To this end, the Ombudsman asked the Council to change its Rules of Procedure, in order to guarantee access for the media and public opinion to its debates. Nevertheless, and despite the recommendation of the British Presidency, the Council has not taken any steps to change its Rules of Procedure in a manner that promotes transparency.\nThe leaders of the Member States can therefore carry on saying the opposite in Brussels to what they are saying to their voters at home. The implications of this openness that we want to see could be profound for the Council and would change its nature. The ministers would have to speak under the scrutiny of the media and under the gaze of millions of people. This would be the best way to make European democracy visible and to awaken ourselves from the current lethargy and boredom.\nThe Council could begin with a pilot programme, which would explain how decisions are made and the nature of the procedure to millions of people in front of the television cameras. I would like to put the following question to the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the Commission: are you prepared to propose concrete initiatives to make transparent and open debates and decision-making in the Council possible? If not now, then when?\nThe citizens and the European Parliament are asking the Council to come out into the open. The ball is in the Council\u2019s court. Please open up your doors.

Por un lado, los l\u00edderes pol\u00edticos de los Estados miembros apoyan el art\u00edculo 1.2 del Tratado de la Uni\u00f3n Europea, incluso han firmado el Tratado por el que se establece una Constituci\u00f3n para Europa, seg\u00fan el cual, las decisiones del Consejo se deben tomar de la forma m\u00e1s transparente, abierta y cercana a la ciudadan\u00eda.\nPero la realidad es muy distinta. El mismo Consejo se niega a abrir sus reuniones legislativas a la opini\u00f3n p\u00fablica y a los medios de comunicaci\u00f3n. El Defensor del Pueblo Europeo tiene raz\u00f3n cuando afirma que estamos ante un caso de mala administraci\u00f3n, al concluir que el Consejo no ha aportado ninguna raz\u00f3n de peso v\u00e1lida para no abrir las puertas de sus deliberaciones.\nPara aumentar el inter\u00e9s y el compromiso de los ciudadanos de a pie con la Uni\u00f3n Europea, y ante la presente crisis constitucional, Europa necesita medidas audaces e imaginativas para acercar los asuntos europeos a todos y a todas. Para empezar, tiene que abrir sus puertas al debate p\u00fablico; sin embargo, el Consejo no quiere hacerlo. Si millones de europeos vieran por televisi\u00f3n a sus ministros discutiendo abiertamente sobre asuntos europeos como la crisis energ\u00e9tica, la Directiva de servicios, la retenci\u00f3n de datos personales o la investigaci\u00f3n con c\u00e9lulas madre, podr\u00edamos despertar mucho m\u00e1s inter\u00e9s hacia los temas europeos y podr\u00edamos despertar del letargo a millones de europeos que muestran muy poco inter\u00e9s por la actualidad europea. La opini\u00f3n p\u00fablica est\u00e1 encerrada en debates estrechamente nacionales.\nEste informe adoptado por la Comisi\u00f3n de Peticiones apoya plenamente la recomendaci\u00f3n del Defensor del Pueblo Europeo, que ha considerado que el principio de transparencia debe aplicarse no solo a las deliberaciones del Consejo, sino a todos los casos en que el Parlamente Europeo est\u00e1 implicado, incluyendo las consultas y los temas relacionados con los derechos y libertades individuales y los comprendidos en el tercer pilar.\nEl pasado mes de octubre, el Defensor del Pueblo Europeo public\u00f3 un informe que ped\u00eda al Consejo que revisase su negativa a reunirse p\u00fablicamente cuando estuviese tomando decisiones de car\u00e1cter legislativo. Para ello, el Defensor del Pueblo ped\u00eda al Consejo que cambiara su reglamento interno, para garantizar as\u00ed el acceso de los medios de comunicaci\u00f3n y la opini\u00f3n p\u00fablica a sus debates. Sin embargo, y a pesar de la recomendaci\u00f3n de la Presidencia brit\u00e1nica, el Consejo no ha tomado medida alguna para cambiar su reglamento interno en aras de favorecer la transparencia.\nAs\u00ed, los l\u00edderes de los Estados miembros pueden seguir diciendo en Bruselas lo contrario de lo que dicen a sus votantes en casa. Las implicaciones de esta apertura que queremos podr\u00edan ser profundas para el Consejo y cambiar\u00edan la naturaleza del mismo. Los ministros tendr\u00edan que expresarse bajo el escrutinio de la prensa y ante los ojos de millones de personas. Esta ser\u00eda la mejor forma de visibilizar la democracia europea y despertarnos del actual letargo y aburrimiento.\nEl Consejo podr\u00eda comenzar incluso con un programa piloto, donde se explicara c\u00f3mo se toman las decisiones y c\u00f3mo es el procedimiento ante millones de personas, ante las c\u00e1maras de televisi\u00f3n. Quisiera plantear la siguiente pregunta a la Presidencia en ejercicio del Consejo y a la Comisi\u00f3n: \u00bfest\u00e1n dispuestos a proponer iniciativas concretas para posibilitar unos debates y una toma de decisiones transparentes y abiertos en el Consejo?

I was the original rapporteur on Regulation (EC) No\u00a01049/2001 on public access to documents and I well remember the heated debates, not only within Parliament but within the Council and within the trialogue, as we set out to win the arguments for what was at that time a groundbreaking regulation. I remember \u2013 and it is worth naming some of the old EU-15 \u2013 the vehement opposition from France, Spain, Italy, Germany and Austria. I am pleased to say that the Austrian Presidency has now changed its attitude, but I mention this because it shows what a long way we have come.\nThere are different approaches to openness and transparency. We have the wonderful Nordic example, and then we have the rather suspicious view taken in other Member States, but arguably we have nothing whatsoever to fear from transparency. What is there to fear from opening our decisions to external examination? What does a Member State have to fear from explaining to its own parliament why the minister voted as he or she did?\nI make several recommendations in my report and I call upon the Commission to take action. We recognise that Regulation (EC) No\u00a01049/2001 was not the end of the game but merely the beginning of a long \u2013 arguably cultural \u2013 journey to win the argument for openness and transparency within the three institutions. We come from different traditions. That is why I have called for a further review of the regulation. This review was provided for in the original recommendation and there are several areas concerning the regulation\u2019s implementation which now, several years later, could be substantially improved on the basis of the lessons that we have learned from its implementation.\nWe need to look again at the definitions of legislative and non-legislative texts in relation to public access to documents, in order to ensure that all the institutions are working in an open and transparent manner. Access to documents is not a gift \u2013 it is a right. This is especially important when Parliament and the Council are working in a legislative capacity. Increased interinstitutional cooperation and increased use of the codecision procedure necessitate greater openness by the Council in particular. Citizens must be able to see what is being agreed in their names by national ministers of national governments so that they and opposition parties can hold them to account.\nWe need to look at the way we define the circumstances in which specific documents can be classified completely, or in part, as confidential. These rules should provide legitimate derogations for specific clearly-defined reasons, but should not be interpreted in a broad sense, which would essentially have the result of denying public access to documents.\nHere is the point on which I shall finish: we won the argument from 1999 until May 2001 when the regulation was adopted. Time and time again we have won the argument for a review of the internal rules of the institutions so that the Council in particular, when meeting in its legislative capacity, should meet in public and vote in public.

(SV) Mr\u00a0President, I wish to begin by congratulating the European Parliament and, of course, the rapporteurs, Mr\u00a0Mintz and Mr\u00a0Cashman, for two very important reports. If I may begin by commenting on openness in the Council, the Commission fully supports open meetings of the Council. As early as October, we stated, in plan D, that the Council should be open when it legislates, and we support the initiatives taken by the Council.\nI am convinced that open meetings of the Council would increase the EU\u2019s credibility, as well as people\u2019s interest in the EU. I know that, in terms of principle, there is a consensus between our institutions on this issue, and it is now the Member States that must take action and deliver results. I also believe that it would be an effective way of putting an end to what we call the \u2018blame game\u2019, so this is an important issue.\nOpenness also has to do with public access to documents and with Regulation 1049/2001. Formally, this legislation applies only to Parliament, the Council and the Commission, but it has, for all that, come to apply to many more bodies. The EU\u2019s various offices and agencies \u2013 indeed, most of its bodies \u2013 have voluntarily adopted corresponding rules concerning access to documents. Just as the rapporteur, Mr\u00a0Cashman said, the EU institutions have in this way \u2013 and thanks in no small measure, then, to the European Parliament \u2013 achieved in a remarkably short period of time a level of openness that is very good indeed compared with that to be found in many Member States.\nThat is not to say that matters cannot be improved. They can and must be. In 2003, the Commission carried out an investigation into the ways in which the regulation had been introduced in the first few years. In 2004 we published our evaluation report. By then the regulation had only been in force for less than two years, but it had operated well, and there was no immediate need to revise it or any legal obligation to do so, either. That was why the Commission thought it better to wait for the Constitutional Treaty to be ratified before we did anything further. The Constitution requires new legislation in this area.\nThe fact is, we all know how matters stand with the Constitutional Treaty. Meanwhile, the European Court of Justice has also produced several proposals for introducing rules governing access to documents. The Commission thought that this was now an appropriate moment at which to begin overhauling the regulation, and the decision to do this is part of the broad European transparency initiative, which we in the Commission decided on in November of last year.\nMr\u00a0Cashman\u2019s report is therefore extremely timely, given that we are in the throes of looking to see how we can improve the rules governing public access to documents. The Commission \u2013 including, I can promise you, myself personally \u2013 will be looking extremely carefully at the report\u2019s recommendations.\nOne of the conclusions drawn by the Commission in its evaluation report of January 2004 was that the regulation had primarily been used by EU professionals, lobbyists, consultants and law firms, rather than by the general public. That is something we want to change, and we must do much more to reach out to people. What, in the first place, we are concerned with here is, of course, public access to documents or the public\u2019s right to keep itself informed, and that is a further argument in support of our wanting to see a general consultation take place before we change the legislation. The Commission intends to hold such a consultation between July and October of this year. We shall then put forward a practical proposal at the end of this year or at the beginning of next year.\nWithout going into the details of the report\u2019s various recommendations, I should simply like to clarify matters in a number of ways. Recommendation\u00a02 talks about increased openness in the legislative procedure and of a clearer dividing line between legislative and administrative documents. The proposal is a very interesting one, at which we shall look closely. The same recommendation also relates to the Official Journal and electronic publication thereof. Our institutions had jointly decided to look at this issue back in 2004, and the Publications Office has already issued a report on the future of the Official Journal.\nRecommendation\u00a03 talks about documents classified as confidential. In this area, we must be careful not to confuse different things. Confidentiality does not in itself lead to a general exception to the rule whereby people have the right of access to documents. A refusal to issue a document classified as confidential must be justified in precisely the same way as a refusal to make any other document available. The procedure is the same, and the institution\u2019s obligations are the same. The same recommendation also discusses the issue of the European Parliament\u2019s access to information classified as confidential. Here too we are in danger of confusing matters. Parliament\u2019s rights in this area are controlled not by the regulation but by Annex\u00a01 to the framework agreement between our institutions. In our experience, the framework agreement operates well.\nI think that recommendation\u00a05 contains quite a few extremely interesting and useful proposals concerning more user-friendly registers and databases. They are proposals requiring no legislation, as they deal with practical details and measures. The interinstitutional committee appointed through the regulation in question last met in November 2005 and decided to appoint a working party to look at those issues, so a solution may be nearer than we think.\nTo conclude, the Commission is very committed to the issue of public access to documents. We have embarked on an overhaul of the regulation, and we have begun to take a closer look at many of the issues discussed in the report. We hope that the European Parliament will continue to help matters along and we expect great things of the general consultation we shall be carrying out between July and October.

They are indeed making a considerable contribution to putting beyond all doubt this House\u2019s willingness to make Europe more transparent.\nIf you do not mind, I would like, briefly, to say something about the Hammerstein Mintz report\u2019s pre-history. It so happened that we were discussing with our friends in the German Young Christian Democrats just how it can happen that we so often get reports in the national media about certain decisions for which the European institutions are then blamed, even though the Council \u2013 which is very visibly present this evening \u2013 had an equal hand in taking them. This, combined with the Convention, gave us the idea of approaching, through Mr Brok, the European Ombudsman in an attempt to find out what the position was on this under the European laws that the Council had played a part in adopting.\nIt is of course, only natural that those who talk a lot about closeness to the public and about the need for the EU to become more democratic, should play an active part in making this a reality. To do so would be to do a great service not only to the esteem in which Europe is held, but also, in this specific instance, to the prestige of the Council and of the European Union as a whole.\nDespite the individual issues that Mr Cashman and Mr\u00a0Hammerstein Mintz have addressed, there is less of a need for action on the transparency and openness front in the Commission and in this House, but certainly a good deal more remains to be done within the Council of Ministers. The way the Council functions does, of course, make this more difficult to some degree, since there are various things that are not as stable as they are in Parliament or in the Commission, but I do nevertheless believe that, in a debate such as this one \u2013 without wanting to offend the Austrian Presidency \u2013 one ought to be able to expect a much more serious approach to be taken to this. There is no doubt about the fact that not all the information that people might like to have can be made available to them, but the fundamentals of transparency should nonetheless apply.

Es war so, dass wir uns mit den Freundinnen und Freunden der Jungen Union \u00fcber die Frage unterhalten haben, wie es eigentlich passieren kann, dass wir in der nationalen \u00d6ffentlichkeit so oft Nachrichten \u00fcber bestimmte Entscheidungen erhalten, die dann den Europ\u00e4ischen Institutionen angelastet werden, obwohl der Rat \u2013 der heute Abend ja auch sehr prominent besetzt ist \u2013 an diesen Entscheidungen parit\u00e4tisch mitgewirkt hat.

Nat\u00fcrlich ist die Arbeitsweise des Ministerrates in gewisser Weise schwieriger, weil die Konstanz verschiedener Dinge nicht so gegeben ist wie im Parlament oder in der Kommission.

The work of Professor Diamandouros, our European Ombudsman, is also closely associated with our Committee. In addressing you on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, but also as Chairman of the Committee on Petitions, I am especially pleased to be able to speak of those three extremely well prepared documents and I would like to congratulate their authors, Mr\u00a0Hammerstein Mintz and Mr Michael Cashman, on their excellent work.\nWe have been speaking of openness today. Sometimes you hear it said, though we have not heard such views today, that not everything needs to be open, that there are negotiations, discussions, preparations. Indeed, we agree with this. These negotiations, discussions and preparations need to take place behind the scenes. We are not demanding the sort of openness that would enable us to eavesdrop on what ministers discuss with colleagues in their offices, or ahead of Council meetings. Once the Council begins its debates, however, we want to know what it is debating and who represents what point of view.\nThere are at least three reasons for demanding such openness. The first reason is simply that we have a right to the truth, and therefore we want to know what the truth is. Secondly, we have a right of oversight. We have a right of oversight as individual Members of the European Parliament and as the European Parliament as a body, and we also have a right of oversight as members and as citizens of the European Union. In addition, our colleagues, the Members of Parliament of the Member States whose ministers speak in the Council, also have a right to know. In other words, both European and national public opinion have a right to know what takes place in the Council.\nThere is also an issue which is especially close to the heart of the Committee on Petitions, and that is bringing European institutions closer to the citizen. If we say that there is a crisis of confidence in European institutions, it is this openness of debates which should overcome this crisis.

The European Parliament has always been the driving force, but I must, in all honesty, also acknowledge that the Commission and the Council have also contributed lately to the really quite huge increase in quality that we have seen over the last five years. We now have a legislative procedure in the EU that, in certain respects, is much more open than that of most national parliaments, my own included.\nThe purpose of this overhaul is to produce the same rules for all three institutions. I of course hope that, in the long term, the process will rub off on the national bodies. The regulations must be designed in such a way that they can be embraced by the majority of institutions in both the EU and the Member States. Parliament is taking this initiative on openness in order to increase democratic control and produce clarifications when legislation is unclear. The minutes of meetings of the Council must be published when the Council acts in its legislative capacity, which does not mean that details of all the Coreper meetings have to be made public.\nJust as in the conciliation process, some scope for negotiation should be guaranteed. Openness should, of course, be applied, however, when decisions on the actual legislation are actually taken. To give the general public access to legal opinions as a matter of course would be to restrict the scope for political action. Either that, or the opinions would be of lower quality. The alternative would be opinions of reduced quality. Parliamentarians involved in a particular issue should, however, be allowed in certain instances to study the legal opinions, once they have undertaken in writing to observe the confidentiality that applies to everyone else who has had a part to play in the matter.\nClear and robust data protection is a basic condition of increased openness. The rights concerned - openness and data protection - complement and reinforce each other. Information given out in confidence must be respected. Nor must we have any retroactive measures in this area. I am convinced that, once the Commission has completed its work, we shall have a fair and balanced proposal. I have every confidence in Mrs\u00a0Wallstr\u00f6m. There must be further development of the way in which people are given access to documents, and the Council must show respect for people and for the democratic process.

I can only repeat what was said by those who spoke before me, because everybody talked about the same issue: parliamentary legislation is a fundamental principle of modern democracy, invested with legislative and executive powers. Although there are certain parliamentary chambers in Member States of the European Union \u2013 such as the British House of Lords \u2013 which are not elected directly by citizens, at Member State level these chambers, too, make their decisions publicly.\nUnfortunately, the Council is an exception to this fundamental principle. Within the democratic system of the European Union, this is the only legislative body in the world that legislates behind closed doors. The exclusion of the public and the secrecy do not increase at all the credibility of the European Union. When a particularly important, controversial issue is being discussed, the debate between Member States would be more transparent and more understandable to everybody if the Council conducted the legislative debate in public, during one of the earlier stages of the process. Therefore, I particularly welcome the excellent report of Mr David Hammerstein, the proposals of Mr Michael Cashman and the report of the European Ombudsman in this matter, and I would like to thank them for their work.

It is because they lock themselves in their rooms. If they were to open these up, they would obtain enough oxygen to last them until the evening so that they might take part in these debates too. Why do they not open their doors? Do not politicians welcome any chance to appear on television? Why, I wonder, is the Council passing up the opportunity to do so?

There have been a number of problems, however, particularly in relation to the inadequate implementation of Regulation (EC) No 1049/01. Accordingly, Parliament has, rightly, repeatedly stressed the need for a review of this regulation, with a view to improving it and strengthening EU legislation in the area of transparency.\nWe have done so because it is crucial to stress the idea of the citizens belonging to and identifying with the European project. For this to happen, there must be a decision-making process based on transparent, open negotiations, and proper cooperation between the institutions, without any unwanted secretiveness. This amended regulation must also form the legal basis for establishing rules, good practices and inter-institutional agreements designed to improve the drafting of legislative texts and to ensure that final legislative texts are accessible.\nI wholeheartedly agree with Mr Cashman, who has once again done an excellent job, when he says that the fact that Parliament does not have a clear legal basis for access to classified EU information runs counter to the democratic principle on which the Union is based.\nIt is also regrettable that the institutions do not have a shared approach on how to manage, share and store various kinds of document. Improvements have undoubtedly been made, but there is still no great coordination between the institutions, especially as regards documents relating to interinstitutional processes. There should also be clear rules on access to administrative documents.\nI shall conclude, Mr President, by turning to an issue that especially affects me as chairman of the temporary committee analysing the CIA flights.

It is rather a legal and moral duty, in keeping with the basic principles of good management of public affairs, or what is known as good governance, because it will enable us gradually to overcome the Europeans\u2019 alienation from the European Union institutions and their growing euroscepticism, and do away with the sort of jokes that say that all we deal with here is the symbolic curvature of the banana.\nIf the European Union is exporting and wishes to export its basic democratic values associated with the protection of human rights and the values of good governance, it must itself become the best example of these values. However, speaking from the perspective of the post-communist new Member States, but also of states aspiring to democracy and states in transition, I must conclude with regret that, due to their limited transparency, European Union institutions are still not the best example to follow. Therefore, we most certainly need new regulations which will particularise the duties of European Union institutions and will provide a clear and precise definition of the circumstances in which access to documents and to the records of Council meetings may be denied.\nHowever in practice tracing most information represents a major problem. To obtain access to a document, one needs first of all to know that it exists. The next important aspect of ensuring the greatest possible access and openness of the meetings of European Union institutions is limiting corruption, conflict of interest and all ambiguities as well as accusations of lack of objectivity in decision making.

Governments find it convenient to blame the Union for decisions which are not in their interests and to claim the merit for decisions which benefit their country.\nDemocracy, however, requires knowledge, judgment and reaction. The lack of knowledge about the positions of governments in the Council also deprives national parliaments of the facility to control the governments of their states on European issues.\nUltimately, the question of the transparency of the Council brings us to the fundamental question of whether or not we want a European public opinion, a public opinion capable of expressing its satisfaction and its displeasure, capable of sending a message to the European institutions and capable of forcing the Council, as the rapporteur rightly notes, into the collective responsibility of its

Debate Information\n\n**Topic:** Openness of meetings of the Council when acting in its legislative capacity - Access to the institutions documents  \n**Number of Contributions:** 29 speakers participated in this debate  \n**Date:** Not specified in the provided materials  \n\nThis debate focused on two interconnected transparency issues: making Council legislative meetings open to the public and improving citizen access to EU institutional documents under Regulation 1049/2001.\n\n## 2. Executive Summary\n\n### Overwhelming Support for Council Transparency\n\nThe debate revealed unanimous cross-party support for opening Council legislative meetings to public scrutiny. All speakers, regardless of political affiliation, argued that the Council's practice of making laws behind closed doors constitutes a fundamental democratic deficit.\n\n**Democratic Legitimacy Arguments:** Multiple speakers emphasized that legislative transparency is a cornerstone of democracy. Johannes Voggenhuber (Verts/ALE) stated: \"What is democracy? Whatever answers have been produced throughout European history over the centuries - there is not a single one in which the publicity of legislation is not described as a fundamental building principle of democracy, without which democracy does not exist.\" Similarly, Alexandra Dobolyi noted that the Council represents \"the only legislative body in the world that makes laws behind closed doors.\"\n\n**Accountability and Scapegoating:** Several speakers highlighted how Council secrecy enables ministers to escape accountability. Alexander Stubb (PPE-DE) explained: \"We all know how ministers use the EU as a scapegoat. First, they tap each other on the shoulder in the Council meeting and say: 'Good compromise'; five minutes after that they go in front of their national media and say: 'We could not do anything'.\" This echoed concerns that transparency would prevent the blame games that damage EU credibility.\n\n### Practical Implementation Proposals\n\n**Simple Procedural Changes:** Multiple speakers emphasized that opening Council meetings requires no treaty changes. Chris Davies (ALDE) noted that implementation needs \"only a simple majority vote to alter the Council's rules of procedure.\" Jens-Peter Bonde proposed \"reversing the transparency procedure so that access to all meetings and documents would be open by default unless specifically decided otherwise.\"\n\n**Technological Solutions:** Proinsias De Rossa (PSE) advocated utilizing \"existing technology including satellite TV, radio, webcasting and other communication tools to make Council legislative debates public and accessible to Europe's 450 million citizens.\"\n\n### Document Access Reform\n\nSpeakers supported overhauling Regulation 1049/2001 governing document access. Michael Cashman (PSE) emphasized: \"Access to documents is not a gift \u2013 it is a right.\" Commissioner Margot Wallstr\u00f6m committed to conducting \"a general public consultation on document access between July and October, followed by a practical legislative proposal by end of year.\"\n\n### Language and Accessibility Concerns\n\nIn\u00e9s Ayala Sender (PSE) raised crucial points about linguistic accessibility: \"De poco servir\u00eda que se publicara toda la informaci\u00f3n, que se abrieran esas puertas, pero solo en dos o tres lenguas\" (It would be of little use if all information were published, if those doors were opened, but only in two or three languages).\n\n### Strong Parliamentary Action Proposed\n\nThe most dramatic proposal came from Johannes Voggenhuber, who suggested: \"Parliament should issue an ultimatum to the Council until the end of the year to change its rules of procedure and establish public access to legislation. If the Council fails to comply, Parliament should reject all legislative proposals from the Council that were not debated and decided publicly.\"\n\n### Balanced Approach Advocates\n\nWhile supporting transparency, some speakers like Charlotte Cederschi\u00f6ld (PPE-DE) advocated for balance: \"She supports increased openness in EU legislation while advocating for a balanced approach that preserves necessary negotiating space and confidentiality.\"\n\n### Commission Support\n\nCommissioner Wallstr\u00f6m strongly endorsed the transparency agenda: \"I am convinced that open meetings of the Council would increase the EU's credibility, as well as people's interest in the EU.\" She committed to concrete legislative proposals and interinstitutional cooperation to advance transparency.\n\n### Key Themes and Consensus\n\nThe debate revealed remarkable consensus across political groups that:\n- Council legislative secrecy undermines democratic legitimacy\n- Transparency would increase citizen engagement and EU credibility  \n- Implementation requires only procedural changes, not treaty amendments\n- Document access regulation needs comprehensive reform\n- Linguistic accessibility is essential for meaningful transparency\n\nThe speakers collectively presented transparency not as a technical reform but as fundamental to European democracy's future, with Maria Matsouka (PSE) summarizing: \"The issue of transparency in the Council ultimately comes down to the fundamental question of whether we want a European public opinion or not.\"\n\nThis debate demonstrates unprecedented parliamentary unity on EU transparency reform, with speakers from all major political groups demanding immediate action to end Council legislative secrecy and improve document access for European citizens.", "src_model": "claude", "model_type": "claude", "model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "structured": true, "incremental": false, "hierarchical": false, "grouped": false, "shuffle": false, "prompt": false, "lang": "original"}
