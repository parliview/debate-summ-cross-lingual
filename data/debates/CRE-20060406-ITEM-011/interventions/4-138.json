{"speaker": "Frederika Brepoels (PPE-DE).", "english": "Frederika Brepoels (PPE-DE). (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, ever since the European Union opened accession negotiations with Turkey, we have received reports of violence and serious human rights violations on a weekly basis, and that is a fact. You yourself gave us a list, but I would like to bring to your attention the brutal murder of the elderly parents of the Kurdish Institute\u2019s chairman in Brussels, although the other victims should not, of course, be forgotten.\nCommissioner Rehn\u2019s first response was to affirm his faith in the Turkish Government, an attitude that I find somewhat strange given that there is increasing evidence of those selfsame authorities playing an active role in this. I do not know whether you have seen the report of the IHD human rights organisation about the killing of Mr and Mrs Ferho, or the judicial inquiry into the bomb attack in \u015eemdinli. They both point in the direction of the Turkish army. When a few weeks ago, a public prosecutor wanted to investigate the direct involvement of the army\u2019s second-in-command \u2013 who is also expected to become Chief of Staff \u2013 the army immediately vetoed the idea. These, then, are the authorities in whom the European Commission has blind faith.\nI have to say, Commissioner, that these incidents do make it painfully clear that Turkey is in no way striving towards a peaceful solution to the conflict with the Kurds. Turkey simply refuses to recognise that the Turkish Kurds possess cultural and democratic rights of self-determination. A country that denies 15 million citizens all political and cultural rights is not what I would call a democracy. Nor, as I see it, can a country whose authorities are actively involved in serious violations of human and international law be described as a constitutional state. Ignoring this reality and failing to send out a powerful message from Europe makes us an accessory.\nI really would like to know what the Commission intends to do in this respect. Will Commissioner Rehn at long last deliver on his promise and include the protection of the minorities in the association agreement or will he not? One crucial step, I think, could be for the European Union to do what Turkey does not do, or refuses to do, and enter into a direct and structural dialogue with representatives of the Kurdish community in Turkey on this matter. I would like to hear your opinion on this.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Frederika Brepoels (PPE-DE).
