The most recent of those was last August, for less than a month. Since then it has continued its campaign of violence and murder. Since last weekend, as the Commissioner and other speakers have mentioned, over a dozen people have died as a result of terrorist violence. Over the years the victims of terrorism have numbered tens of thousands.\nTurkey\u2019s EU accession negotiations are now under way. That is itself a factor in the PKK campaign. The PKK is not interested in a stable, thriving and democratic Turkey oriented to the West. It would prefer its own little Marxist state, living in the past.\nOf course we want to see reforms in Turkey as part of a modernising agenda; of course we want to see great economic improvements in south-eastern Turkey.
