{"speaker": "Camiel Eurlings,", "english": "Camiel Eurlings, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . \u2013 Mr President, the situation we are discussing here this afternoon is tragic, because recent events have been very bad for Turkey and for the Kurdish citizens of Turkey.\nLet us be clear, the PPK is a terrorist organisation and there is never an excuse for terrorism. I am saying as a parliamentarian that the national parliament of the Netherlands fought hard to get the PKK on the terrorist list. There can never be an excuse.\nHowever, at the same time, we must ask ourselves whether all the people who are protesting really support violence. Many analysts have drawn a completely different conclusion. They say that most Kurdish people do not want violence, they just want to have a prosperous future \u2013 with economic, social and cultural developments \u2013 within the state of Turkey. Now, more than ever, we need to invest in those people.\nIn Parliament\u2019s report adopted at the end of 2004, we pressed for the development of the south east and for more cultural rights for the Kurdish people. It must be said that Prime Minister Erdogan has made impressive speeches since that time. However, at this difficult time these words must be followed more than ever by deeds. We must invest socially and economically so that people and their families have a prosperous future, so that they do not want violence for their children. We have to invest in more cultural freedom. If Turkish television and radio provided more air time for Kurdish programmes, then Roj TV in Denmark will not be that important any more.\nIndeed, the village guard system should be abolished and displaced people should be helped to return to their home regions.\nNow is the time for wisdom instead of big words. It is time the Turkish Government tried to find interlocutors who are modest and want peace. I name Mr Baydemir and Mr T\u00fcrk, the co-leader of the DTP. These people must continue to speak out against violence; but if they continue to do so, let the Turkish Government cooperate with them instead of a Minister of the Interior threatening to bring them to justice. I think cooperation is the way; wisdom is the way. Let us ensure that Kurdish citizens feel at home in one Turkish state.
