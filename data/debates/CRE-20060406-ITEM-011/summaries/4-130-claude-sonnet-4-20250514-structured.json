They are all doing their bit in their own way to impede Turkey\u2019s progress towards the European Union.\nThe Turkish police and army are not serving the interests of the Turkish Government in their excessive use of force against protestors in Diyarbakir and other towns. The deep state is not under the democratic control of that government. The fact is the military has a vested interest in the prolongation of the violence, because that enhances its power, its importance and its resources.\nThe PKK does employ terrorist methods, and it has no doubt provoked and stirred up some of the recent violence, but its aims of achieving recognition of the cultural, linguistic and political identity of the Kurdish people are shared by many Kurds who do not espouse violence. To that extent, the PKK are seen as freedom fighters. The challenge, one where the Turkish authorities are failing, is to separate the die-hard opponents of violence and those who want to pursue a democratic route to a political solution.\nA very hopeful development over the last few days has been the very moderate calls by people like Ahmed T\u00fcrk and Osman Baydemir, the major of Diyarbakir, for an end to the violence and for political discussions. I somewhat regret that the Commission did not say anything about encouraging the Turkish Government to go down this route: not only of social and economic progress, which clearly is needed, not only of the recognition of linguistic and cultural rights, but of actually talking about political dialogue and a political solution in the Kurdish region in south-east Turkey in the construction of the Turkish State.\nThe Commission seems to baulk at giving the Turkish Government that encouragement. We all need to rally round and encourage Prime Minister Erdogan to carry on where he seemed to start last August but where he has stalled, no doubt because of the army. We all need to help him get the political dialogue for a solution going.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Sarah Ludford, on behalf of the ALDE Group . \u2013 Mr President, clearly there is an unholy alliance \u2013 though an unacknowledged and unintended alliance \u2013 between the Turkish security forces, the PKK and the European opponents of Turkey\u2019s accession.
