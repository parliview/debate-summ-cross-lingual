{"speaker": "Emine Bozkurt,", "english": "Emine Bozkurt, on behalf of the PSE Group . (NL) Mr President, Turkey is close to the heart of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, and so it is heartrending to see that country plagued by violence. The PSE Group is calling for an end to the escalation of violence, and we welcome Prime Minister Erdogan\u2019s indication of his intention to turn the tide of violence by bringing about more democratic and economic reforms.\nBy doing this, he has extended a hand to the Kurdish community, which, though, has yet to accept this gesture. The PSE Group would also draw your attention to the appeal made by the Mayor of Diyarbakir to those Kurds who use violence, to abandon this strategy, because my group emphatically denounces excessive violence. If the violence stops, the tanks can, and indeed must, leave the streets of the towns and villages in the south-east. Tanks in the streets are not what people in Europe want to see when they consider the possibility of Turkey joining the European Union. I would like to stress that everyone in Turkey, including the Kurds, stands to benefit if Turkey\u2019s progress down the road to EU membership is uninterrupted. Indeed, the protection of, and respect for, human rights of everyone in Turkey is a conditio sine qua non for EU membership.\nWe must not allow agitators to sabotage the negotiations before they have got well and truly underway. It is unfortunate that the current violence interrupts a period of rapprochement , because some progress had already been made, for example, by the Turkish Government making Kurdish television possible. The agreements that were in place before the recent outbreak of violence must be further developed and, above all, implemented. That which has been committed to paper must be translated into reality.\nI should like to finish off with a few words for the victims, for it is right that they should be remembered and mourned. There must be no more of them. I urge you to turn this difficult moment in Turkey into an opportunity for renewed solidarity in that country, which is desperately needed on the long and difficult road to EU membership.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Emine Bozkurt, on behalf of the PSE Group .
