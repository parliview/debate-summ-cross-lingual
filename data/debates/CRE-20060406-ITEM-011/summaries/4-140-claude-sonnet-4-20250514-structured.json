{"speaker": "Markos Kyprianou,", "english": "Markos Kyprianou, Member of the Commission . Mr President, I wish to thank Members for this very interesting discussion. I have listened with great interest to your remarks and these were duly noted.\nI think we can all conclude that the situation in south-east Turkey is serious and, therefore, we all look forward to that situation being addressed vigorously through a comprehensive strategy, encompassing not just security concerns \u2013 which are legitimate \u2013 but also the socio-economic development of the region and the development of cultural rights.\nI should like to refer to Prime Minister Erdogan\u2019s speech of August 2005 \u2013 which I mentioned earlier \u2013 in which he emphasised the need to resolve through democratic means what he described as \u2018the Kurdish issue\u2019. The Commission will encourage the Turkish Government and its Prime Minister to take steps based on the commitment they made in that speech in Diyarbakir.\nThe stability of the region is key to properly addressing those issues and the continuation of terrorist attacks represents a serious threat in this respect. At the same time, it is very important that the security forces and the authorities show restraint and do not use excessive force when they deal with civilians.\nI should like to comment on a few issues raised by Members. With regard to the Semdinli incidents, I should like to say that investigations are going on both in the judiciary but also in the parliament and we are awaiting the outcome of those investigations and we will continue to follow the situation.\nI have noted the issue of progress and we are continually encouraging the Turkish Government to continue with the reforms and to extend more rights to the Kurdish people. I refer to the recent development \u2013 at least it is a positive step \u2013 of allowing broadcasts in the Kurdish language at certain times on the television and radio. We expect more to be done in this respect.\nI can assure Members that we will continue to monitor the situation in the south east. All these issues will be raised with the Turkish authorities as part of our regular monitoring of the political criteria.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Markos Kyprianou, Member of the Commission .
