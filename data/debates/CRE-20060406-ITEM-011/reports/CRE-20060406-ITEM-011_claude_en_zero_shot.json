Mr President, the Commission is concerned about the events occurring in the south-east of Turkey and about the outbursts of violence and terrorist attacks that have spread to other cities in the country. We are closely following the situation.\nAccording to the information available to the Commission, an outburst of violence started on 28\u00a0March, in the south-eastern city of Diyarbakir following the funeral of PKK members. May I remind honourable Members that the PKK is included in the European Union\u2019s list of terrorist organisations.\nThe first victims were reported on 29\u00a0March in Diyarbakir and other fatalities were reported in the following days throughout the region. Over the weekend, riots also spread to Istanbul, where a Molotov cocktail was thrown into a crowded city bus. Three civilians were killed. Since then other fatalities have been reported, including among the security forces.\nLet me be clear, the European Union unequivocally condemns terrorism. The PKK is a terrorist organisation. We are deeply concerned about its recent activities in Turkey. We feel that we are victims of these terrorist acts. But at the same time, we deeply deplore human casualties and call on the Turkish authorities to shed light on those events, through a comprehensive investigation, and to make sure that the security forces show the necessary strength in face of the demonstrators.\nThe people in the south-east of Turkey do not need violence and confrontation; they need peace, stability and prosperity. We urge the Turkish Government to address in a comprehensive manner\u00a0\u2013 and not only from the security point of view\u00a0\u2013 the problems of this region and of its people, who are for the most part of Kurdish origin.\nThe Turkish Government should take action with a view to enhancing and ensuring economic, social and cultural opportunities for all Turkish citizens. In this respect, we look forward to the follow-up of Prime Minister\u00a0Erdogan\u2019s speech in August 2005. The Commission recalls and stresses that under the Copenhagen political criteria, Turkey must ensure cultural diversity and promote the cultural rights of all its citizens as set out in the revised Accession Partnership adopted by the Council in January\u00a02006.\nIt is also important that Turkey facilitates the return of internally displaced people to their original settlements, ensures fair compensation for those who have suffered loss and damage as a result of the security situation, and addresses the abolition of the village guard system.\nWe will continue to monitor the situation in the south-east. We will raise these issues with the Turkish authorities as part of our regular monitoring of the political criteria.

The chasm running through its society must not be allowed to become even deeper, to the point of becoming unbridgeable.\nThe Turkish Head of State, Mr Erdogan, has described the murders of women and children as necessary interventions to deal with the instruments of terrorism. To date, 15 people have lost their lives, including three children, the youngest of whom was aged only three. Of the 278 persons detained in Diyarbakir, 91 are under the age of 18. If the Turkish security forces continue to shoot at civilians in Diyarbakir, Batman, Mardin and in many other Kurdish cities, and if the death toll rises still higher, then this chasm will become wider and the prospect of a peaceful solution more distant.\nIt is now high time for the Commission and the Council to use all the means at their disposal to bring pressure on Turkey to end the violence. The possibility needs to be discussed of the accession negotiations being suspended if the Turkish Government and the Turkish army continue to disregard democratic principles and violate human rights.

The chasm running through its society must not be allowed to become even deeper, to the point of becoming unbridgeable.\nThe Turkish Head of State, Mr Erdogan, has described the murders of women and children as necessary interventions to deal with the instruments of terrorism. To date, 15 people have lost their lives, including three children, the youngest of whom was aged only three. Of the 278 persons detained in Diyarbakir, 91 are under the age of 18. If the Turkish security forces continue to shoot at civilians in Diyarbakir, Batman, Mardin and in many other Kurdish cities, and if the death toll rises still higher, then this chasm will become wider and the prospect of a peaceful solution more distant.\nIt is now high time for the Commission and the Council to use all the means at their disposal to bring pressure on Turkey to end the violence. The possibility needs to be discussed of the accession negotiations being suspended if the Turkish Government and the Turkish army continue to disregard democratic principles and violate human rights. I call for an ad hoc delegation to be sent to Turkey to get to the bottom of what is going on there. I appeal to all those involved in the conflict to cease forthwith from violence, and I call on the Turkish Government to accept the Kurds\u2019 lawfully elected representatives as negotiating partners and to drop the latest charges against them.\nIt cannot \u2013 it must not \u2013 be tolerated any longer that 20 million Kurds should be denied their political and cultural rights and a say in how their society is shaped."}, {"speaker": "Jan Tadeusz Masiel (NI). \u2013", "english": "Jan Tadeusz Masiel (NI). \u2013 (PL) Mr President, Commissioner, the attitude of the Turkish authorities towards current events in Diyarbakir and the management of the crisis in south-eastern Turkey are unacceptable from the point of view of the European Parliament.

Nonetheless, this must not lead us to conclude that this is the only problem in Turkey: there is a major problem in connection with the rights of Kurds, which is something we should not sweep under the carpet in today's debate.\nTurkey has chosen its prospects. It has chosen European prospects and, thanks to these prospects, we have seen some progress over recent years on the question of the human rights of the Kurds, whose existence was barely recognised a few years ago.\nHowever, Turkey must continue on this course. The recent uncontrolled interventions by the army must not deprive the Kurds of the rights which they must have if Turkey is to become a member of the European Union, by which I mean the rights enjoyed by the citizens of European states.\nPrime Minister Erdogan announced recently that Turkey would not step away from its objective of democracy and development and that it would introduce greater freedoms, more democracy, social assistance, rights and justice. This announcement is all well and good, but it needs to be more than just an announcement; it needs to be put into practice.\nMeasures are needed on three levels: firstly rights are needed; secondly, economic and social policy is needed and, thirdly, the army, which has uncontrolled powers, needs to be restricted. If these measures are introduced, Turkey will have taken its European prospects seriously and if Turkey honours its commitments in both this area and in all the other areas stipulated by the European Union, this will be to the benefit both of the Kurds and of all the citizens of Turkey.\nTurkey should not therefore hesitate: Mr Erdogan's words must go hand in hand with action from now on.",

Nonetheless, this must not lead us to conclude that this is the only problem in Turkey: there is a major problem in connection with the rights of Kurds, which is something we should not sweep under the carpet in today's debate.\nTurkey has chosen its prospects. It has chosen European prospects and, thanks to these prospects, we have seen some progress over recent years on the question of the human rights of the Kurds, whose existence was barely recognised a few years ago.\nHowever, Turkey must continue on this course. The recent uncontrolled interventions by the army must not deprive the Kurds of the rights which they must have if Turkey is to become a member of the European Union, by which I mean the rights enjoyed by the citizens of European states.\nPrime Minister Erdogan announced recently that Turkey would not step away from its objective of democracy and development and that it would introduce greater freedoms, more democracy, social assistance, rights and justice. This announcement is all well and good, but it needs to be more than just an announcement; it needs to be put into practice.\nMeasures are needed on three levels: firstly rights are needed; secondly, economic and social policy is needed and, thirdly, the army, which has uncontrolled powers, needs to be restricted. If these measures are introduced, Turkey will have taken its European prospects seriously and if Turkey honours its commitments in both this area and in all the other areas stipulated by the European Union, this will be to the benefit both of the Kurds and of all the citizens of Turkey.\nTurkey should not therefore hesitate: Mr Erdogan's words must go hand in hand with action from now on."}, {"speaker": "Panagiotis Beglitis (PSE).", "english": "Panagiotis Beglitis (PSE). \u2013 (EL) Mr President, we are extremely concerned about the revival of violence and the acts of terrorism by the Turkish army and the PKK. I believe that the message to come out of our debate today must be a message of condemnation of the acts of terrorism against innocent civilians in Istanbul and other towns and of the military violence by the Turkish forces of repression against the Kurdish population.\nThe powers pushing for war and for the army to stay in power at all costs are responsible for the situation in south-east Turkey. The powers that be and the army in Turkey find in the action of the PKK a convenient pretext for continuing to intervene in political life and trying to define the terms of the resolution to the Kurdish problem. On the other hand, the PKK is taking advantage of the serious economic and social problems of under-development and poverty to feed with its actions the cycle of violence and bloodshed.\nIt is a fact, and it would be a political mistake for us to underestimate it, that Turkey's European prospects paved the way for reforms by the Erdogan government. However, reforms are still at an early stage, are incomplete and are driven by the historic fear of the Turkish people against the Kurdish people.\nWe must support consistently and decisively the cultural, linguistic and education rights of the Kurdish community; we must support political rights; we must call for the electoral law prohibiting the democratic representation of the Kurdish community in the political life of Turkey to be amended.\nThe Turkish political leadership and the Erdogan government are responsible for proceeding with courage and decisiveness to complete the reforms and for the smooth political, economic and social integration of the Kurdish people. A strategy of peaceful resolution depends on dialogue between the two sides. It presupposes the renunciation, by both sides, of the philosophy of military conflict and of the solution. The Kurdish problem will be resolved not on terms of suppression and violence, but on terms of democratic dialogue, development and the flourishing of the rights of the Kurdish people.\nThe European Union has its political responsibility for formulating an integrated strategy for the Kurdish problem in Turkey:\n- it must remain a constant and consistent supporter of its European prospects, while at the same time controlling, without concessions and expediencies, the honouring of obligations by Turkey;\n- it must confirm its support for the territorial integrity and unity of the Turkish state and condemn the objectives of secession in the dead-end strategy of the PKK;\n- it must take initiatives to start democratic dialogue on a political solution to the Kurdish problem and on the safeguarding of the role and rights of the Kurdish community in the institutions and society of Turkey.\nFinally, the European Union, in cooperation with Turkish and Kurdish agencies, must help to formulate and implement economic and social reconstruction programmes to combat poverty and under-development, support the institutions and civil society and support the democratic moderate political forces in the area of south-east Turkey.", "lang": "EL", "original": "\u03a0\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03b9\u03ce\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u039c\u03c0\u03b5\u03b3\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 (PSE). \u2013

I believe that the message to come out of our debate today must be a message of condemnation of the acts of terrorism against innocent civilians in Istanbul and other towns and of the military violence by the Turkish forces of repression against the Kurdish population.\nThe powers pushing for war and for the army to stay in power at all costs are responsible for the situation in south-east Turkey. The powers that be and the army in Turkey find in the action of the PKK a convenient pretext for continuing to intervene in political life and trying to define the terms of the resolution to the Kurdish problem. On the other hand, the PKK is taking advantage of the serious economic and social problems of under-development and poverty to feed with its actions the cycle of violence and bloodshed.\nIt is a fact, and it would be a political mistake for us to underestimate it, that Turkey's European prospects paved the way for reforms by the Erdogan government. However, reforms are still at an early stage, are incomplete and are driven by the historic fear of the Turkish people against the Kurdish people.\nWe must support consistently and decisively the cultural, linguistic and education rights of the Kurdish community; we must support political rights; we must call for the electoral law prohibiting the democratic representation of the Kurdish community in the political life of Turkey to be amended.\nThe Turkish political leadership and the Erdogan government are responsible for proceeding with courage and decisiveness to complete the reforms and for the smooth political, economic and social integration of the Kurdish people. A strategy of peaceful resolution depends on dialogue between the two sides. It presupposes the renunciation, by both sides, of the philosophy of military conflict and of the solution. The Kurdish problem will be resolved not on terms of suppression and violence, but on terms of democratic dialogue, development and the flourishing of the rights of the Kurdish people.\nThe European Union has its political responsibility for formulating an integrated strategy for the Kurdish problem in Turkey:\n- it must remain a constant and consistent supporter of its European prospects, while at the same time controlling, without concessions and expediencies, the honouring of obligations by Turkey;\n- it must confirm its support for the territorial integrity and unity of the Turkish state and condemn the objectives of secession in the dead-end strategy of the PKK;\n- it must take initiatives to start democratic dialogue on a political solution to the Kurdish problem and on the safeguarding of the role and rights of the Kurdish community in the institutions and society of Turkey.\nFinally, the European Union, in cooperation with Turkish and Kurdish agencies, must help to formulate and implement economic and social reconstruction programmes to combat poverty and under-development, support the institutions and civil society and support the democratic moderate political forces in the area of south-east Turkey."}, {"speaker": "Marios Matsakis (ALDE). \u2013", "english": "Marios Matsakis (ALDE). \u2013 Mr President, the situation in south-east Turkey is indeed extremely worrying but should not surprise anyone.

Debate Information\n\n**Date:** April 6, 2006  \n**Number of Contributions:** 16 speakers  \n**Topic:** Commission statement on the situation in South-East Turkey, focusing on violence between Turkish security forces and Kurdish populations, PKK terrorism, and broader Kurdish rights issues\n\n## 2. Executive Summary\n\n### Core Issues Addressed\n\nThe debate centered on escalating violence in south-east Turkey that began on March 28, 2006, following PKK members' funeral in Diyarbakir, resulting in at least 15 civilian and security force casualties. Broader issues included Kurdish cultural and political rights, Turkey's EU accession process, internally displaced persons, the village guard system, and the role of Turkey's military establishment.\n\n### Positions and Arguments\n\n**European Commission (Markos Kyprianou)** took a balanced approach, condemning PKK terrorism while calling for comprehensive Turkish government action beyond security measures. Kyprianou emphasized: \"The people in the south-east of Turkey do not need violence and confrontation; they need peace, stability and prosperity\" [Kyprianou, 2006-04-06]. The Commission proposed investigating violent events, enhancing economic/social opportunities, facilitating return of displaced persons, and addressing the village guard system.\n\n**Centre-right EPP-DE Group** members offered varying perspectives. **Camiel Eurlings** distinguished between PKK terrorists and peaceful Kurdish citizens, arguing: \"Most Kurdish people do not want violence, they just want to have a prosperous future \u2013 with economic, social and cultural developments \u2013 within the state of Turkey\" [Eurlings, 2006-04-06]. He advocated cooperation with moderate Kurdish leaders like Baydemir and T\u00fcrk rather than prosecution. **Konstantinos Hatzidakis** supported Turkey's European prospects while demanding concrete action: \"Mr Erdogan's words must go hand in hand with action from now on\" [Hatzidakis, 2006-04-06]. Conversely, **Jan Tadeusz Masiel** called for suspension of EU negotiations, arguing Turkey's treatment of Kurds indicated it would disrespect other European cultures.\n\n**Socialist PSE Group** speakers emphasized EU membership benefits. **Emine Bozkurt** warned that \"tanks in the streets are not what people in Europe want to see when they consider the possibility of Turkey joining the European Union\" [Bozkurt, 2006-04-06], while supporting continued accession progress. **Panagiotis Beglitis** condemned both PKK terrorism and Turkish military violence, proposing EU initiatives for democratic dialogue and economic reconstruction programs.\n\n**Liberal ALDE Group** members provided critical analysis. **Sarah Ludford** identified an \"unholy alliance\" between Turkish security forces, PKK, and EU opponents of Turkish accession, all impeding Turkey's progress. She argued: \"The challenge, one where the Turkish authorities are failing, is to separate the die-hard opponents of violence and those who want to pursue a democratic route to a political solution\" [Ludford, 2006-04-06]. **Marios Matsakis** took the strongest pro-Kurdish stance, arguing for Kurdish autonomy and amnesty for PKK militants while supporting Erdogan against military resistance.\n\n**Green Verts/ALE Group** advocated balanced approaches. **Cem \u00d6zdemir** condemned both sides while citing Kurdish and Turkish intellectuals' consensus that Kurdish identity must be officially recognized but the PKK cannot be Turkey's negotiation partner. **Alyn Smith** emphasized EU integrity as an \"honest, impartial broker\" while applying Copenhagen criteria consistently.\n\n**Left GUE/NGL Group** representative **Feleknas Uca** took the most critical stance toward Turkey, arguing: \"For as long as Turkey tries to resolve this problem by military means, suppressing the civilian population and suppressing the free expression of opinions and ideas, there will be no peace in the land and hence no basis for a democratic state\" [Uca, 2006-04-06]. She proposed potentially suspending EU negotiations and sending investigative delegations.\n\n**Conservative voices** like **Geoffrey Van Orden** focused primarily on condemning PKK terrorism, arguing: \"The greatest service that could be given to the people of south-eastern Turkey is for Kurdish extremist groups to cease their campaign of violence and terrorism\" [Van Orden, 2006-04-06].\n\n### Key Proposals and Recommendations\n\nMultiple speakers proposed similar solutions: implementing comprehensive investigations of violence, enhancing economic and social development in Kurdish regions, expanding cultural rights including Kurdish-language broadcasting, cooperating with moderate Kurdish political leaders, abolishing the village guard system, facilitating return of displaced persons, and ensuring security forces exercise restraint.\n\nThe debate revealed consensus on condemning violence from all sides while disagreeing on the balance between security concerns and Kurdish rights recognition. Most speakers supported Turkey's EU candidacy contingent on democratic reforms, though some called for suspension of negotiations. The Commission's closing response emphasized continuing to monitor the situation and encouraging Turkey to implement Prime Minister Erdogan's August 2005 commitments to democratic resolution of the Kurdish issue.\n\n**Frederika Brepoels** raised particular concerns about EU Commission credibility, stating: \"A country that denies 15 million citizens all political and cultural rights is not what I would call a democracy\" [Brepoels, 2006-04-06], while proposing direct EU dialogue with Kurdish community representatives.\n\nThe debate highlighted the complex intersection of security concerns, minority rights, democratic development, and EU enlargement policy in addressing one of Turkey's most persistent challenges.", "src_model": "claude", "model_type": "claude", "model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "structured": false, "incremental": false, "hierarchical": false, "grouped": false, "shuffle": false, "prompt": false, "lang": "english"}
