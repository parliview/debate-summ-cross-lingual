Let me start by reading through the provided debate summary carefully.\n\nThe summary mentions that there were 16 speakers from various political groups and the European Commission. The main topics were the situation in South-East Turkey, PKK-related incidents, and EU accession negotiations. The Commission's position was presented by Commissioner Markos Kyprianou, who condemned PKK terrorism and called for comprehensive solutions beyond security measures. Then there are contributions from different political groups like PPE-DE, PSE, ALDE, Verts/ALE, GUE/NGL, and others. Each of these groups had their own points, like advocating for Kurdish rights, criticizing Turkish institutions, or calling for stronger actions.\n\nBut the user is asking about the \"President.\" Wait, in the context of the European Parliament, the President would be the person presiding over the session. However, in the summary provided, the main speakers mentioned are commissioners and members of different political groups. The summary starts with the Commission's position by Commissioner Kyprianou, then lists contributions from various politicians. However, there's no mention of the President of the European Parliament speaking in this debate. \n\nThe user's query specifies that if there are no points attributed to the speaker (in this case, the President), I should respond with an empty string. So I need to check if the President is mentioned as making any contributions. Looking through the summary again, the sections are labeled with the speakers' names and their political groups. For example, \"Commissioner Markos Kyprianou,\" \"Camil Eurlings (PPE-DE),\" \"Emine Bozkurt (PSE),\" etc. There's a section titled \"Commission Position\" which is attributed to Kyprianou, but no mention of the President of the European Parliament. \n\nThe President of the European Parliament during that time was Hans-Gert P\u00f6ttering, but the summary doesn't reference him. The closing Commission response is mentioned, but that's from Kyprianou. The summary also mentions that the debate had contributions from 16 speakers, but none of them are identified as the President. \n\nTherefore, based on the provided information, there's no indication that the President made any statements in this particular debate. The user's instruction is to only include points attributed to the specified speaker, and since the President isn't mentioned as contributing anything, the correct response is an empty string.\n</think>\n\n\"", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Markos Kyprianou,", "english": "Markos Kyprianou, Member of the Commission .

May I remind honourable Members that the PKK is included in the European Union\u2019s list of terrorist organisations.\nThe first victims were reported on 29\u00a0March in Diyarbakir and other fatalities were reported in the following days throughout the region.

The instructions say not to include arguments from other speakers, only those attributed to him. If there are none, I should return an empty string. \n\nLooking at the debate summary, there's a section titled \"Commission Position\" where Commissioner Markos Kyprianou is mentioned. The summary says he established the framework by condemning PKK terrorism and calling for comprehensive solutions beyond security measures. It quotes him as saying, \"the people in the south-east of Turkey do not need violence and confrontation; they need peace, stability and prosperity\" and that Turkey should address issues through economic, social, and cultural opportunities, not just security.\n\nSo, the key points here are: condemning PKK terrorism, advocating for solutions beyond security (i.e., economic, social, cultural), and emphasizing the need for peace, stability, and prosperity. The user wants only the points from Kyprianou. The rest of the summary talks about other speakers like Eurlings, Bozkurt, Ludford, etc., but those shouldn't be included. \n\nI need to make sure I don't include any other speakers' points. The answer should be a list of Kyprianou's arguments. Let me check again. The summary under \"Commission Position\" is about Kyprianou. The quotes are his. So the main points are:\n\n1. Condemn PKK terrorism.\n2. Call for comprehensive solutions beyond security measures.\n3. Emphasize that the people in SE Turkey need peace, stability, and prosperity.\n4. Urge Turkey to address issues through economic, social, and cultural opportunities, not just security.\n\nI should present these as the main points.

(NL) Mr President, Turkey is close to the heart of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, and so it is heartrending to see that country plagued by violence. The PSE Group is calling for an end to the escalation of violence, and we welcome Prime Minister Erdogan\u2019s indication of his intention to turn the tide of violence by bringing about more democratic and economic reforms.\nBy doing this, he has extended a hand to the Kurdish community, which, though, has yet to accept this gesture. The PSE Group would also draw your attention to the appeal made by the Mayor of Diyarbakir to those Kurds who use violence, to abandon this strategy, because my group emphatically denounces excessive violence. If the violence stops, the tanks can, and indeed must, leave the streets of the towns and villages in the south-east. Tanks in the streets are not what people in Europe want to see when they consider the possibility of Turkey joining the European Union. I would like to stress that everyone in Turkey, including the Kurds, stands to benefit if Turkey\u2019s progress down the road to EU membership is uninterrupted. Indeed, the protection of, and respect for, human rights of everyone in Turkey is a conditio sine qua non for EU membership.\nWe must not allow agitators to sabotage the negotiations before they have got well and truly underway.

Let me start by looking at the provided debate summary. The user mentioned that the answer should only include the points attributed to the specified speaker, which in this case is Emine Bozkurt.\n\nFrom the summary, under the section \"Mainstream Support for Balanced Approach,\" there's a mention of Emine Bozkurt (PSE) emphasizing that \"tanks in the streets are not what people in Europe want to see when they consider the possibility of Turkey joining the European Union\" [Bozkurt, 2006-04-06]. So her main argument here is linking the presence of military forces (tanks) in the streets of Turkey's southeast to the EU's consideration of Turkey's accession. She's suggesting that the use of military force is a negative factor in Turkey's EU negotiations.\n\nI need to make sure there are no other mentions of Bozkurt in the summary. Let me scan through the other sections. The Commission Position, other political groups, calls for Kurdish rights, harsh criticism, pro-Turkish government perspectives, and competing proposals. I don't see any other quotes or references to Emine Bozkurt. The rest of the summary talks about other speakers like Eurlings, Ludford, \u00d6zdemir, etc., but not Bozkurt.\n\nSo the only point attributed to her is the one about tanks in the streets and EU accession. The user's instruction says if there are no points, return an empty string, but here there is one. Therefore, the answer should be that she linked the military presence to the EU's consideration of Turkey's accession, implying that the EU would not want to see tanks in the streets if they're considering Turkey's entry into the EU.\n</think>\n\nEmine Bozkurt (PSE) linked the presence of military forces in the southeast of Turkey to the European Union's considerations regarding Turkey's accession, stating that \"tanks in the streets are not what people in Europe want to see when they consider the possibility of Turkey joining the European Union.\" This argument directly tied the security situation in Turkey's Kurdish regions to the EU's evaluation of Turkey's eligibility for membership.", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Sarah Ludford,", "english": "Sarah Ludford, on behalf of the ALDE Group . \u2013 Mr President, clearly there is an unholy alliance \u2013 though an unacknowledged and unintended alliance \u2013 between the Turkish security forces, the PKK and the European opponents of Turkey\u2019s accession.

The summary has sections on different speakers. Let me check the part about Sarah Ludford.\n\nIn the \"Mainstream Support for Balanced Approach\" section, it says Sarah Ludford (ALDE) provided the most critical analysis of Turkish institutions, identifying an \"unholy alliance\" between Turkish security forces, the PKK, and European opponents of Turkey's accession. She argued that the military has a \"vested interest in the prolongation of the violence\" and called for political dialogue beyond social and economic reforms.\n\nSo her main arguments are: \n\n1.

The user specified to only include points attributed to Sarah Ludford. The summary mentions her in the context of critical analysis of Turkish institutions, so those three points are hers. I should present them clearly, maybe as a list. Also, check if there's more. The summary says she called for political dialogue beyond social and economic reforms.

That is why I believe it is important that we draw attention to the debate that is currently going on in civil society in Turkey, amongst intellectuals of Turkish and Kurdish origin.\nLet me point out what they have said: first, Kurdish identity in Turkey must finally be officially recognised by the Turkish state; second, the policy for assimilating Kurds has been a complete failure; third, the Turkish state has to make sure that it gets back the trust of the Kurds and every citizen of Turkey; fourth, there cannot be any peaceful solution that insists that the PKK is the official negotiation partner of the state, because that will not happen.\nI finish by quoting a former mayor of Diyarbakir, who has just pointed out: \u2018If we are going to have real peace here, the PKK has to adjust itself to the new world situation. The Turkish state is becoming more democratic. The PKK needs to do the same. It should give up the idea of armed struggle and open respectful dialogue with Kurds who think differently. It also needs to renovate its leadership. This organisation was formed with a Cold War mentality. It needs to evolve\u2019.", "reconstructed_position": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out the main points that Cem \u00d6zdemir made in the debate. Let me start by looking through the provided summary.\n\nThe user mentioned that the debate was about the situation in South-East Turkey, focusing on PKK-related incidents and Turkey's EU accession. The summary has sections on different speakers. Let me check the part about Cem \u00d6zdemir.\n\nLooking at the \"Calls for Comprehensive Kurdish Rights\" section, it says: \"Cem \u00d6zdemir (Verts/ALE) outlined a balanced four-point framework from Turkish and Kurdish intellectuals: official recognition of Kurdish identity, acknowledgment that assimilation policies failed, restoring state-Kurdish trust, and rejecting the PKK as official negotiation partner. He emphasized that 'the PKK has to adjust itself to the new world situation' [\u00d6zdemir, 2006-04-06].\"\n\nSo, \u00d6zdemir's main points are the four-point framework. Let me break that down. The first point is official recognition of Kurdish identity. The second is acknowledging that assimilation policies didn't work. Third, restoring trust between the state and Kurds. Fourth, not recognizing the PKK as a negotiation partner. Also, he mentioned the PKK needs to adapt to the new situation.\n\nI need to make sure I don't include anything else from other speakers. The user specified to only include points attributed to the given speaker, which is Cem \u00d6zdemir. The summary mentions other speakers like Eurlings, Bozkurt, Ludford, etc., but those are not relevant here.\n\nSo the answer should list the four points from \u00d6zdemir's framework and his comment about the PKK adjusting. I should present them clearly, maybe as a numbered list. The user wants the main points or arguments made by that speaker, so these four points are the key ones. I need to check if there's anything else in the summary about \u00d6zdemir. The rest of the summary talks about other speakers, so I think that's all. Alright, that should cover it.\n</think>\n\nCem \u00d6zdemir proposed a four-point framework for addressing Kurdish rights and tensions in Turkey:  \n1. **Official recognition of Kurdish identity** as a foundational step.  \n2. **Acknowledgment of the failure of assimilation policies** that previously suppressed Kurdish cultural and linguistic rights.  \n3. **Restoration of trust** between the Turkish state and Kurdish communities through inclusive dialogue.  \n4. **Rejection of the PKK as an official negotiation partner**, emphasizing the need for the PKK to adapt to contemporary political realities.  \n\nHe stressed that the PKK must \"adjust itself to the new world situation,\" framing the conflict as requiring both Kurdish self-restraint and systemic reforms.", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Feleknas Uca,", "english": "Feleknas Uca, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. \u2013 (DE) Mr President, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, and in particular of my colleague Mr Agnoletto, I would like to express my horror at the violent clashes in South-Eastern Turkey. For over a week, we have been seeing horrifying pictures, and getting horrifying reports, from a country with which the EU commenced accession negotiations in October 2005, to which, at that time, my group colleagues and I consented. Although, since commencing accession talks with the EU, the Turkish Government has initiated a reform process, it is not one that will be sufficient to resolve the country\u2019s social and political problems and conflicts.\nWhere these are concerned, there is one thing that should be clear to Turkey and to all of us, and that is that Turkey\u2019s democratic deficits were and are closely tied up with the Kurdish question. For as long as Turkey tries to resolve this problem by military means, suppressing the civilian population and suppressing the free expression of opinions and ideas, there will be no peace in the land and hence no basis for a democratic state. The chasm running through its society must not be allowed to become even deeper, to the point of becoming unbridgeable.\nThe Turkish Head of State, Mr Erdogan, has described the murders of women and children as necessary interventions to deal with the instruments of terrorism. To date, 15 people have lost their lives, including three children, the youngest of whom was aged only three. Of the 278 persons detained in Diyarbakir, 91 are under the age of 18. If the Turkish security forces continue to shoot at civilians in Diyarbakir, Batman, Mardin and in many other Kurdish cities, and if the death toll rises still higher, then this chasm will become wider and the prospect of a peaceful solution more distant.\nIt is now high time for the Commission and the Council to use all the means at their disposal to bring pressure on Turkey to end the violence. The possibility needs to be discussed of the accession negotiations being suspended if the Turkish Government and the Turkish army continue to disregard democratic principles and violate human rights. I call for an ad hoc delegation to be sent to Turkey to get to the bottom of what is going on there. I appeal to all those involved in the conflict to cease forthwith from violence, and I call on the Turkish Government to accept the Kurds\u2019 lawfully elected representatives as negotiating partners and to drop the latest charges against them.\nIt cannot \u2013 it must not \u2013 be tolerated any longer that 20 million Kurds should be denied their political and cultural rights and a say in how their society is shaped.", "lang": "DE", "original": "Feleknas Uca, im Namen der GUE/NGL-Fraktion . \u2013 Herr Pr\u00e4sident!

It has chosen European prospects and, thanks to these prospects, we have seen some progress over recent years on the question of the human rights of the Kurds, whose existence was barely recognised a few years ago.\nHowever, Turkey must continue on this course. The recent uncontrolled interventions by the army must not deprive the Kurds of the rights which they must have if Turkey is to become a member of the European Union, by which I mean the rights enjoyed by the citizens of European states.\nPrime Minister Erdogan announced recently that Turkey would not step away from its objective of democracy and development and that it would introduce greater freedoms, more democracy, social assistance, rights and justice.

Let me start by reading through the provided debate summary carefully.\n\nFirst, the user mentioned that the response should only include the points attributed to the specified speaker. So I need to look for any mentions of Konstantinos Hatzidakis in the summary. \n\nLooking at the sections, there's a part under \"Calls for Comprehensive Kurdish Rights\" and another under \"Competing Proposals\". Wait, in the \"Calls for Comprehensive Kurdish Rights\" section, there's a mention of Konstantinos Hatzidakis (PPE-DE) with a quote: \"Mr Erdogan's words must go hand in hand with action from now on\" [Hatzidakis, 2006-04-06], calling for three levels of measures: rights, economic policy, and military restraint.\n\nSo the key points here are that Hatzidakis emphasized the need for action alongside Erdogan's words, and he outlined three areas: rights, economic policy, and military restraint. I need to make sure there are no other mentions of him elsewhere in the summary. \n\nLooking through the rest of the document, the other sections mention other speakers like Camiel Eurlings, Emine Bozkurt, Sarah Ludford, Cem \u00d6zdemir, Feleknas Uca, Jan Tadeusz Masiel, and Geoffrey Van Orden. There's no other mention of Konstantinos Hatzidakis. \n\nTherefore, the main points from Hatzidakis are the three levels of measures: rights, economic policy, and military restraint. The quote about Erdogan's words needing to be matched with action is also part of his argument. \n\nI should present these points clearly, ensuring that I don't include any other speakers' arguments. The user wants only the points from Hatzidakis, so I need to be precise.\n</think>\n\nKonstantinos Hatzidakis (PPE-DE) called for three levels of measures to address the situation in South-East Turkey, emphasizing that \"Mr Erdogan's words must go hand in hand with action from now on.\" These measures included:  \n1. **Rights** \u2013 addressing Kurdish rights.  \n2. **Economic policy** \u2013 implementing economic reforms.  \n3. **Military restraint** \u2013 limiting the military's role and ensuring restraint.", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Panagiotis Beglitis (PSE).", "english": "Panagiotis Beglitis (PSE). \u2013 (EL) Mr President, we are extremely concerned about the revival of violence and the acts of terrorism by the Turkish army and the PKK. I believe that the message to come out of our debate today must be a message of condemnation of the acts of terrorism against innocent civilians in Istanbul and other towns and of the military violence by the Turkish forces of repression against the Kurdish population.\nThe powers pushing for war and for the army to stay in power at all costs are responsible for the situation in south-east Turkey. The powers that be and the army in Turkey find in the action of the PKK a convenient pretext for continuing to intervene in political life and trying to define the terms of the resolution to the Kurdish problem. On the other hand, the PKK is taking advantage of the serious economic and social problems of under-development and poverty to feed with its actions the cycle of violence and bloodshed.\nIt is a fact, and it would be a political mistake for us to underestimate it, that Turkey's European prospects paved the way for reforms by the Erdogan government. However, reforms are still at an early stage, are incomplete and are driven by the historic fear of the Turkish people against the Kurdish people.\nWe must support consistently and decisively the cultural, linguistic and education rights of the Kurdish community; we must support political rights; we must call for the electoral law prohibiting the democratic representation of the Kurdish community in the political life of Turkey to be amended.\nThe Turkish political leadership and the Erdogan government are responsible for proceeding with courage and decisiveness to complete the reforms and for the smooth political, economic and social integration of the Kurdish people. A strategy of peaceful resolution depends on dialogue between the two sides. It presupposes the renunciation, by both sides, of the philosophy of military conflict and of the solution. The Kurdish problem will be resolved not on terms of suppression and violence, but on terms of democratic dialogue, development and the flourishing of the rights of the Kurdish people.\nThe European Union has its political responsibility for formulating an integrated strategy for the Kurdish problem in Turkey:\n- it must remain a constant and consistent supporter of its European prospects, while at the same time controlling, without concessions and expediencies, the honouring of obligations by Turkey;\n- it must confirm its support for the territorial integrity and unity of the Turkish state and condemn the objectives of secession in the dead-end strategy of the PKK;\n- it must take initiatives to start democratic dialogue on a political solution to the Kurdish problem and on the safeguarding of the role and rights of the Kurdish community in the institutions and society of Turkey.\nFinally, the European Union, in cooperation with Turkish and Kurdish agencies, must help to formulate and implement economic and social reconstruction programmes to combat poverty and under-development, support the institutions and civil society and support the democratic moderate political forces in the area of south-east Turkey.", "lang": "EL", "original": "\u03a0\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03b9\u03ce\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u039c\u03c0\u03b5\u03b3\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 (PSE). \u2013

The task is to focus only on Alyn Smith's contributions and not include others.\n\nLooking through the summary, under the \"Calls for Comprehensive Kurdish Rights\" section, there's a mention of Cem \u00d6zdemir (Verts/ALE) outlining a four-point framework. However, the user is asking about Alyn Smith, not Cem \u00d6zdemir. Wait, the speaker name given is Alyn Smith, but in the summary, the onlyVerts/ALE speaker mentioned is Cem \u00d6zdemir. There's no mention of Alyn Smith in the provided debate summary. \n\nThe user might have made a mistake, but according to the data given, there's no information about Alyn Smith's contributions. The summary doesn't list Alyn Smith as one of the speakers. TheVerts/ALE group is mentioned in the context of Cem \u00d6zdemir's speech. Therefore, since there's no data on Alyn Smith's arguments, the correct response would be an empty string as per the instructions.\n</think>\n\n\"\")", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Frederika Brepoels (PPE-DE).", "english": "Frederika Brepoels (PPE-DE).

Mr President, I wish to thank Members for this very interesting discussion. I have listened with great interest to your remarks and these were duly noted.\nI think we can all conclude that the situation in south-east Turkey is serious and, therefore, we all look forward to that situation being addressed vigorously through a comprehensive strategy, encompassing not just security concerns \u2013 which are legitimate \u2013 but also the socio-economic development of the region and the development of cultural rights.\nI should like to refer to Prime Minister Erdogan\u2019s speech of August 2005 \u2013 which I mentioned earlier \u2013 in which he emphasised the need to resolve through democratic means what he described as \u2018the Kurdish issue\u2019. The Commission will encourage the Turkish Government and its Prime Minister to take steps based on the commitment they made in that speech in Diyarbakir.\nThe stability of the region is key to properly addressing those issues and the continuation of terrorist attacks represents a serious threat in this respect. At the same time, it is very important that the security forces and the authorities show restraint and do not use excessive force when they deal with civilians.\nI should like to comment on a few issues raised by Members. With regard to the Semdinli incidents, I should like to say that investigations are going on both in the judiciary but also in the parliament and we are awaiting the outcome of those investigations and we will continue to follow the situation.\nI have noted the issue of progress and we are continually encouraging the Turkish Government to continue with the reforms and to extend more rights to the Kurdish people. I refer to the recent development \u2013 at least it is a positive step \u2013 of allowing broadcasts in the Kurdish language at certain times on the television and radio. We expect more to be done in this respect.\nI can assure Members that we will continue to monitor the situation in the south east. All these issues will be raised with the Turkish authorities as part of our regular monitoring of the political criteria.", "reconstructed_position": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out the main points or arguments made by Markos Kyprianou based on the provided debate summary. Let me start by looking through the summary again to find any mentions of him.\n\nIn the \"Commission Position\" section, it says that Commissioner Markos Kyprianou established the framework by condemning PKK terrorism while calling for comprehensive solutions beyond security measures. The summary includes a quote from him: \"the people in the south-east of Turkey do not need violence and confrontation; they need peace, stability and prosperity\" and he urged Turkey to address issues \"not only from the security point of view\" but through economic, social and cultural opportunities.\n\nSo, the main points here are that he condemned PKK terrorism, emphasized the need for solutions beyond just security, and highlighted the importance of peace, stability, and prosperity through economic, social, and cultural measures. I need to make sure I don't include anything else from other speakers. The user specified that only the points attributed to Markos Kyprianou should be included. The summary mentions that he set the framework, so these points are his. I should present them clearly, using the quotes and the context provided.

The user provided a detailed summary of a parliamentary debate about the situation in South-East Turkey, and they want me to outline the main points made by the speaker named \"President.\" \n\nFirst, I need to check the debate summary to see if the President is mentioned. Scanning through the sections, the main contributors listed are various political group members, the European Commission, and others. The \"President\" isn't explicitly mentioned in any of the contributions. The Commission's position is covered by Commissioner Markos Kyprianou, but there's no mention of a President speaking. \n\nThe user's instructions say that if there are no points attributed to the speaker, I should return an empty string. Since the President isn't listed as a speaker in the summary, there's nothing to include. I need to make sure I'm not missing any sections where the President might be referenced. The debate information mentions 16 speakers from various groups and the European Commission, but the President isn't among them. \n\nTherefore, the correct response is an empty string because there's no information about the President's contributions in the provided summary.\n</think>\n\n\"", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}]
