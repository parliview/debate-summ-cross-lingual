He also emphasizes monitoring and engagement.\n\nThe arguments he used are based on the need to address root causes and the importance of socio-economic and cultural aspects alongside security. \n\nProposals would include the comprehensive strategy and continuous monitoring.

The key quote is: \"The challenge, one where the Turkish authorities are failing, is to separate the die-hard opponents of violence and those who want to pursue a democratic route to a political solution.\" \n\nSo, the issue she's addressing is the need to distinguish between those who oppose violence and those who seek a democratic solution. Her position is that the Turkish authorities are failing in this separation. The argument here is that without this distinction, it's hard to achieve a political solution. However, the user's example response includes \"issueSum,\" \"positionSum,\" \"argSum,\" and \"propSum.\" \n\nWait, the user's example has \"issueSum\" as the key issue, \"positionSum\" as the speaker's stance, \"argSum\" as the reasoning, and \"propSum\" as proposals. But in the debate summary, Ludford's contribution is about the challenge of separating opponents of violence from those seeking a democratic route. There's no specific proposal mentioned here, just the argument that this separation is necessary. \n\nSo, for \"issueSum,\" I should note that the issue is the need to differentiate between violent opponents and those seeking democratic solutions. \"PositionSum\" would be her stance that the Turkish authorities are failing in this. The argument is that this separation is crucial for a political solution. There's no explicit proposal mentioned, so \"propSum\" might be empty. \n\nWait, but the user's example includes \"propSum\" even if there's no proposal. The instructions say if there are no points, respond with an empty string. So I need to check if Ludford made any proposals. In the debate summary, under \"Key Proposals,\" there are structural reforms, but those are general. The specific mention of Ludford is only in the core arguments part. There's no mention of her proposing specific actions, just her argument about the challenge. \n\nTherefore, the response would have \"issueSum\" as the need to separate violent opponents from democratic seekers, \"positionSum\" as the failure of Turkish authorities, \"argSum\" as the reasoning that this separation is necessary for a political solution, and \"propSum\" as empty since there's no proposal mentioned.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The issue raised by the speaker relates to the challenge of distinguishing between die-hard opponents of violence and those seeking a democratic political solution in the context of the Kurdish conflict in Turkey.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"The speaker argues that the Turkish authorities are failing to adequately separate these groups, which hinders progress toward a political solution.\",\n\"argSum\": \"The speaker's argument is that without this distinction, it is impossible to address the root causes of the conflict and achieve lasting peace, as the current approach fails to engage with those seeking democratic resolution.\",\n\"propSum\": \"\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Cem \u00d6zdemir,", "english": "Cem \u00d6zdemir, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . \u2013 Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for his speech.

His arguments are about condemning both the excessive force by Turkish security forces and the PKK's provocations. \n\nThe user's example response structure requires issueSum, positionSum, argSum, propSum. \n\nFor issueSum, the key issues \u00d6zdemir raised would be the excessive use of force by security forces and PKK's actions. But the user's example for another speaker had \"trade secrets and intellectual property\" as the issue. So here, the issue is the situation in South-East Turkey, specifically the violence and the actions of both PKK and Turkish forces.\n\nPositionSum: He condemns both the disproportionate force by police and the PKK's provocations. So his position is a balanced condemnation.\n\nArgSum: The argument here is that he's calling out both sides to prevent further violence. The example given in the user's example had an argument based on preventing improper use, so here the argument would be that condemning both sides is necessary for peace.\n\nPropSum: The proposals would be the immediate actions mentioned in the key proposals, but the user's example had specific proposals. However, in the debate summary, \u00d6zdemir's contributions are about condemnation, not specific proposals. The key proposals section mentions ending violence, removing military presence, etc., but those are general. Since the user's instruction says to only include points attributed to the speaker, and the summary only mentions \u00d6zdemir's condemnation, there might be no specific proposals from him. \n\nWait, the user's example had \"He advocates for strict limitations on government demands for private data\" as a proposal. But in the given debate summary, \u00d6zdemir's contributions are about condemning both sides. The key proposals in the summary are from others, like Eurlings, Hatzidakis, etc. So perhaps \u00d6zdemir didn't make specific proposals beyond his condemnation. Therefore, propSum would be empty.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nissueSum: The key issues are the excessive use of force by Turkish security forces and PKK provocations in South-East Turkey.\n\npositionSum: He condemns both the disproportionate use of force by police and the PKK's provocations.\n\nargSum: His argument is that both sides' actions contribute to the violence and need to be addressed for stability.\n\npropSum: There are no specific proposals mentioned for \u00d6zdemir, so it's an empty string.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The key issues raised by the speaker relate to the violence in south-east Turkey, including the excessive use of force by Turkish security forces against Kurdish civilians and the provocations by the PKK.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"The speaker condemned the disproportionate use of force by police in Diyarbakir and Kiziltepe while also vehemently denouncing the PKK's provocations.\",\n\"argSum\": \"The argument is that addressing both sides' actions is necessary to prevent further violence and achieve stability in the region.\",\n\"propSum\": \"\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Feleknas Uca,", "english": "Feleknas Uca, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. \u2013 (DE) Mr President, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, and in particular of my colleague Mr Agnoletto, I would like to express my horror at the violent clashes in South-Eastern Turkey. For over a week, we have been seeing horrifying pictures, and getting horrifying reports, from a country with which the EU commenced accession negotiations in October 2005, to which, at that time, my group colleagues and I consented. Although, since commencing accession talks with the EU, the Turkish Government has initiated a reform process, it is not one that will be sufficient to resolve the country\u2019s social and political problems and conflicts.\nWhere these are concerned, there is one thing that should be clear to Turkey and to all of us, and that is that Turkey\u2019s democratic deficits were and are closely tied up with the Kurdish question. For as long as Turkey tries to resolve this problem by military means, suppressing the civilian population and suppressing the free expression of opinions and ideas, there will be no peace in the land and hence no basis for a democratic state. The chasm running through its society must not be allowed to become even deeper, to the point of becoming unbridgeable.\nThe Turkish Head of State, Mr Erdogan, has described the murders of women and children as necessary interventions to deal with the instruments of terrorism. To date, 15 people have lost their lives, including three children, the youngest of whom was aged only three. Of the 278 persons detained in Diyarbakir, 91 are under the age of 18. If the Turkish security forces continue to shoot at civilians in Diyarbakir, Batman, Mardin and in many other Kurdish cities, and if the death toll rises still higher, then this chasm will become wider and the prospect of a peaceful solution more distant.\nIt is now high time for the Commission and the Council to use all the means at their disposal to bring pressure on Turkey to end the violence. The possibility needs to be discussed of the accession negotiations being suspended if the Turkish Government and the Turkish army continue to disregard democratic principles and violate human rights. I call for an ad hoc delegation to be sent to Turkey to get to the bottom of what is going on there. I appeal to all those involved in the conflict to cease forthwith from violence, and I call on the Turkish Government to accept the Kurds\u2019 lawfully elected representatives as negotiating partners and to drop the latest charges against them.\nIt cannot \u2013 it must not \u2013 be tolerated any longer that 20 million Kurds should be denied their political and cultural rights and a say in how their society is shaped.", "lang": "DE", "original": "Feleknas Uca, im Namen der GUE/NGL-Fraktion . \u2013 Herr Pr\u00e4sident!

Seit \u00fcber einer Woche erreichen uns erschreckende Bilder und Nachrichten aus einem Land, mit dem die EU im Oktober 2005 Beitrittsverhandlungen aufgenommen hat. Der Aufnahme dieser Verhandlungen haben meine Fraktionskolleginnen und -kollegen und ich seinerzeit zugestimmt.

Der Graben, der durch die Gesellschaft geht, darf nicht noch tiefer werden, bis er un\u00fcberwindbar wird.\nDer t\u00fcrkische Staatschef Erdo\u011fan hat die Morde an Frauen und Kindern als notwendige Interventionen gegen die Werkzeuge des Terrors bezeichnet. Bisher verloren 15 Menschen dabei ihr Leben, darunter drei Kinder, von denen das j\u00fcngste gerade einmal drei Jahre alt war. Von den 278 Verhafteten in Diyarbak\u0131r sind 91 unter 18 Jahre alt. Wenn die t\u00fcrkischen Sicherheitskr\u00e4fte weiterhin in Diyarbak\u0131r, in Batman, in Mardin und in vielen anderen kurdischen St\u00e4dten auf Zivilisten schie\u00dfen und die Zahl der get\u00f6teten Menschen weiter ansteigt, dann wird dieser Graben breiter und eine friedliche L\u00f6sung r\u00fcckt weiter in die Ferne.\nDie Europ\u00e4ische Kommission und der Rat sind jetzt aufgefordert, die T\u00fcrkei mit allen ihnen zur Verf\u00fcgung stehenden Mitteln zur Beendigung der Gewalt zu bewegen.

Uca is mentioned here. The quote says: \"It cannot \u2013 it must not \u2013 be tolerated any longer that 20 million Kurds should be denied their political and cultural rights and a say in how their society is shaped.\" \n\nSo, the key issue here is the denial of political and cultural rights to Kurds. Uca's position is that this denial is unacceptable. The argument is that Kurds should have a say in their society's shaping. The proposal isn't explicitly stated in the quote, but since he's advocating for rights, maybe the proposal is about granting those rights. However, the user's example includes propSum as specific actions. The original debate summary's \"Key Proposals\" mention implementing Kurdish cultural rights, but Uca's specific proposal isn't detailed beyond his statement. So maybe the propSum would be about ensuring those rights. But I need to stick strictly to what's attributed to him. The user's example for propSum was \"He advocates for strict limitations on government demands for private data,\" which is a specific action. In Uca's case, the summary says he declared that the denial must stop. So the propSum might be about ensuring political and cultural rights. But the user's instructions say to only include points attributed to the speaker. The debate summary doesn't mention specific proposals from Uca beyond his statement. So maybe propSum is empty. Wait, the example given by the user has propSum as a proposal. But in the debate summary, Uca's contribution is a statement of condemnation, not a specific proposal. The key proposals in the summary are listed under \"Key Proposals,\" but those are general. So perhaps Uca's propSum isn't mentioned. Therefore, the answer would have issueSum about Kurdish rights, positionSum about condemning the denial, argSum about the need for rights, and propSum might be empty. But the user's example includes propSum even if it's not explicit. Wait, the user's instruction says to only include points attributed to the speaker.

The user provided a debate summary about the situation in South-East Turkey and wants the main points from Konstantinos Hatzidakis (PPE-DE). \n\nFirst, I need to look through the debate summary and find any mentions of Hatzidakis. Scanning through the \"Executive Summary\" section, under \"Key Issues Identified\" and \"Spectrum of Positions,\" I see that Hatzidakis is mentioned in the \"EU Integration Supporters\" part. The summary states: \"Hatzidakis noted that 'Turkey's European prospects have already led to positive developments in Kurdish rights recognition,' while emphasizing that 'Mr Erdogan's words must go hand in hand with action from now on.'\"\n\nSo, the key issue here is Turkey's EU accession and its impact on Kurdish rights. His position is that Turkey's EU prospects have contributed to positive changes in Kurdish rights, but he stresses the need for action to match words. The argument is that EU integration has already brought some improvements, but more concrete steps are needed. The proposal is to continue accession negotiations while monitoring compliance with the Copenhagen criteria.\n\nI need to make sure I don't include other speakers' points. The user specified to only include Hatzidakis's arguments. The response should be in JSON format as per the example. Let me structure each part: issueSum, positionSum, argSum, propSum. Check for any other mentions of Hatzidakis in the summary. The rest of the sections like \"Core Arguments\" and \"Key Proposals\" don't mention him again. So the info is only from the \"EU Integration Supporters\" part.\n\nNow, formulating the JSON. IssueSum should mention EU accession and Kurdish rights. PositionSum is about supporting EU negotiations while needing action. Argument is based on EU prospects leading to positive developments. Proposal is to continue negotiations with monitoring.

I believe that the message to come out of our debate today must be a message of condemnation of the acts of terrorism against innocent civilians in Istanbul and other towns and of the military violence by the Turkish forces of repression against the Kurdish population.\nThe powers pushing for war and for the army to stay in power at all costs are responsible for the situation in south-east Turkey. The powers that be and the army in Turkey find in the action of the PKK a convenient pretext for continuing to intervene in political life and trying to define the terms of the resolution to the Kurdish problem. On the other hand, the PKK is taking advantage of the serious economic and social problems of under-development and poverty to feed with its actions the cycle of violence and bloodshed.\nIt is a fact, and it would be a political mistake for us to underestimate it, that Turkey's European prospects paved the way for reforms by the Erdogan government. However, reforms are still at an early stage, are incomplete and are driven by the historic fear of the Turkish people against the Kurdish people.\nWe must support consistently and decisively the cultural, linguistic and education rights of the Kurdish community; we must support political rights; we must call for the electoral law prohibiting the democratic representation of the Kurdish community in the political life of Turkey to be amended.\nThe Turkish political leadership and the Erdogan government are responsible for proceeding with courage and decisiveness to complete the reforms and for the smooth political, economic and social integration of the Kurdish people. A strategy of peaceful resolution depends on dialogue between the two sides. It presupposes the renunciation, by both sides, of the philosophy of military conflict and of the solution. The Kurdish problem will be resolved not on terms of suppression and violence, but on terms of democratic dialogue, development and the flourishing of the rights of the Kurdish people.\nThe European Union has its political responsibility for formulating an integrated strategy for the Kurdish problem in Turkey:\n- it must remain a constant and consistent supporter of its European prospects, while at the same time controlling, without concessions and expediencies, the honouring of obligations by Turkey;\n- it must confirm its support for the territorial integrity and unity of the Turkish state and condemn the objectives of secession in the dead-end strategy of the PKK;\n- it must take initiatives to start democratic dialogue on a political solution to the Kurdish problem and on the safeguarding of the role and rights of the Kurdish community in the institutions and society of Turkey.\nFinally, the European Union, in cooperation with Turkish and Kurdish agencies, must help to formulate and implement economic and social reconstruction programmes to combat poverty and under-development, support the institutions and civil society and support the democratic moderate political forces in the area of south-east Turkey.", "lang": "EL", "original": "\u03a0\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03b9\u03ce\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u039c\u03c0\u03b5\u03b3\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 (PSE). \u2013

The user provided a debate summary about the situation in Southeast Turkey and wants the response for Markos Kyprianou. First, I need to check the debate summary to find what Kyprianou said.\n\nLooking at the \"Executive Summary\" section under \"Commissioner's Response,\" it mentions that Commissioner Kyprianou concluded by reaffirming the Commission's commitment to a comprehensive strategy. The key points here are addressing security concerns, socio-economic development, and cultural rights. He also mentions continuous monitoring and engagement with Turkish authorities on political criteria.\n\nNow, the user's example response structure requires four fields: issueSum, positionSum, argSum, propSum. Let me parse each part.\n\nIssueSum should be the main issue he addressed. The summary says he talked about a comprehensive strategy including security, socio-economic development, and cultural rights. So the issue is the multifaceted approach needed for peace in Southeast Turkey.\n\nPositionSum: His position is supporting the Commission's strategy that includes these elements. The example mentions \"supports the Data Act's objectives but emphasizes concerns,\" so here it's about supporting a comprehensive approach while monitoring.\n\nArgSum: The argument is that lasting peace requires addressing root causes beyond security. The debate summary mentions that speakers differed on balancing terrorism condemnation, criticizing state responses, and supporting Kurdish rights. Kyprianou's argument is that the strategy must include socio-economic and cultural aspects.\n\nPropSum: The proposal is the comprehensive strategy with monitoring and engagement. The example had \"advocates for strict limitations,\" so here it's about the Commission's commitment to monitoring and engagement.\n\nWait, the user's example for propSum is a specific action. In Kyprianou's case, the proposal is the comprehensive strategy, but the exact wording from the summary is \"reaffirming the Commission's commitment to a comprehensive strategy... while promising continued monitoring and regular engagement.\"\n\nSo, the propSum should reflect that. Let me structure each part accordingly, making sure not to include other speakers' points. The user specified to only include points attributed to the speaker, which in this case is Kyprianou. The response should be in JSON format, properly escaped, and parseable.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The key issue raised by the speaker relates to the need for a comprehensive strategy to address the conflict in south-east Turkey, encompassing security, socio-economic development, and cultural rights.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"He supports a balanced approach that addresses both security concerns and the socio-economic and cultural development of the region, while emphasizing the importance of monitoring Turkey's compliance with democratic standards.\",\n\"argSum\": \"His position is based on the belief that lasting peace requires addressing root causes beyond military solutions, including economic and cultural factors, alongside ensuring accountability for human rights violations.\",\n\"propSum\": \"He advocates for continued EU monitoring of Turkey's compliance with political criteria and regular engagement with Turkish authorities to ensure a comprehensive strategy for peace and development in the region.\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "President.", "english": "President.

The speakers listed are various MEPs and commissioners like Kyprianou, \u00d6zdemir, Uca, Matsakis, Masiel, Brepoels, Van Orden, Eurlings, Hatzidakis, Ludford, and others.
