I believe that aid is an important tool in this fight for a better world. The EU\u2019s aid policy is in itself very poor. However, it is undermined by other policy areas too. Firstly, the EU conducts an agricultural policy in which absurd subsidies are given to relatively rich farmers. This, together with the duties that the EU imposes on agricultural products from poor countries, leads to a situation in which agricultural policy actively militates against aid.\nSecondly, the EU\u2019s trade policy leads to poor countries being deprived of the ability to enter our market with their competitive products. A topical and instructive example of this type of damaging protectionism is the EU\u2019s recent imposition of duties on shoes from, for example, Vietnam. Thirdly and lastly, I believe that development cooperation should take place at Member State level. If aid is to be as effective as possible, it is, of course, always crucially important that efforts be coordinated.\nThis coordination should, however, take place at UN level where donors from all over the world, and not only from the EU, work together in order to bring about effective aid which, as a matter of actual fact, leads to a reduction in poverty. This process really would lead to the world\u2019s poor countries being given a better deal, an outcome that should be the main purpose of aid.", "lang": "SV", "original": "H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Goudin, f\u00f6r IND/DEM-gruppen . \u2013 Herr talman! Internationell solidaritet och att d\u00e4rmed kunna hj\u00e4lpa m\u00e4nniskor i utvecklingsl\u00e4nder ligger mig mycket varmt om hj\u00e4rtat. Jag anser att bist\u00e5nd \u00e4r ett viktigt redskap i denna kamp f\u00f6r en b\u00e4ttre v\u00e4rld. EU:s bist\u00e5ndspolitik \u00e4r i sig mycket d\u00e5lig. Men den motarbetas \u00e4ven av andra politikomr\u00e5den. F\u00f6r det f\u00f6rsta bedriver EU en jordbrukspolitik d\u00e4r absurda subventioner ges till relativt sett rika b\u00f6nder. Detta samt de tullar som EU har p\u00e5 jordbruksprodukter fr\u00e5n fattiga l\u00e4nder leder till att jordbrukspolitiken aktivt motarbetar bist\u00e5ndet.\nF\u00f6r det andra leder EU:s handelspolitik till att fattiga l\u00e4nder ber\u00f6vas m\u00f6jligheten att komma in p\u00e5 v\u00e5r marknad med sina konkurrenskraftiga produkter. Ett aktuellt och belysande exempel p\u00e5 denna typ av skadlig protektionism \u00e4r de tullar p\u00e5 skor EU nyligen inf\u00f6rt mot bl.a. Vietnam. F\u00f6r det tredje och sista anser jag att utvecklingssamarbete b\u00f6r bedrivas p\u00e5 medlemsstatsniv\u00e5.
