{"speaker": "Mairead McGuinness (PPE-DE). \u2013", "english": "Mairead McGuinness (PPE-DE). \u2013 Mr President, last night the word \u2018corruption\u2019 was mentioned several times in our debate on World Health Day 2006. This morning we are debating the scale and extent of it. I congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent report.\nSome Members have mentioned the global problem of corruption. I think we are deluding ourselves if we say that it is just a problem for the developing world. I would suggest that they have learned from the developed world: much to our shame, we have taught them some tricks. We therefore owe it to them and to ourselves to clean up our own act. I would support my colleague, Mr\u00a0Ryan, who said that the banks and the financial institutions need to be looked at in this entire process, because if there were no home to put the money into perhaps they might not be so corrupt.\nThis morning I spoke to some aid agencies that have long experience in this area. Their key message to us is that we must build up the capacity within the systems and the civil service of the developing world, and then build that into all our aid programmes. They also said that this is a long-term process and we will not get results overnight. I think a big part of our crackdown on the corrupt is to take them out within the developed world first and then perhaps assist the rooting-out of corruption in the developing world.\nWhatever we do, we must not penalise those who most need our aid, money and assistance. I always feel when we talk about tackling corruption that it is they who will again suffer. That is the one message. Let us build it into our programmes, but let us ensure that we keep up our aid work, that it gets to the right people and that they do not suffer.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Mairead McGuinness (PPE-DE). \u2013 Mr President, last night the word \u2018corruption\u2019 was mentioned several times in our debate on World Health Day 2006.
