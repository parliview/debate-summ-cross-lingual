Quantitatively speaking, Europe is the world\u2019s greatest donor, but there has been a growing global awareness over recent years of the truth that the way aid is targeted is at least as important as the quantity of it.\nLast year\u2019s Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness forms an important benchmark for action on this front and the Commission has recently responded to it by means of a package of measures on the effectiveness of aid which we will shortly be discussing in the Committee on Development Cooperation.\nMy own-initiative report, on which we are to vote today, makes a few serious recommendations as to how to make aid more effective. The effectiveness of aid is dependent to a large degree on good governance, free from corruption, for not only is it the case that aid money is raked off, but corruption is also a hindrance to development and has a disproportionate effect on the poorest members of society. It makes access to essential services, such as basic education and health care, more difficult and sometimes impossible.\nCorruption is an enormous problem on a worldwide scale. Estimates by the World Bank suggest that in any one year, over USD\u00a01 billion \u2013 that is, 1\u00a0000 billion in our terms \u2013 is paid in bribes. In Africa, the world\u2019s poorest continent, the amount estimated as being lost \u2013 USD\u00a0148 billion \u2013 is more or less equivalent to 25% of the continent\u2019s GDP, and corruption is present at every level of society and nearly everyone is affected by it: politicians, civil servants, the media, multinational enterprises and the international donor community. Responsibility for good governance and effective aid is shared by the donor community and the developing countries themselves; \u2018it takes two to tango\u2019. My proposals therefore deal with what we \u2013 the European Union, the Commission and the Member States \u2013 can do in practical terms, preferably together with the international community as a whole.\nMy principal proposal is for the drawing up of a blacklist of corrupt regimes, which should receive no further loans from banks or other financial institutions. Those who do lend money to governments on such a list would be exposing themselves to the risk of debt and would be unable to ask the international community to bail them out. This would prevent the people from becoming the ultimate victims of the likes of Marcos, Kabila, Abacha or any of their successors.\nI then propose that a small percentage \u2013 0.5% \u2013 of the amount paid out directly to a country\u2019s government be required to be paid as budget support to civil society watchdogs. Such groups, belonging to organised civil society, are engaged in the public monitoring of the government\u2019s income and expenditure in terms of the development goals. There also needs to be support \u2013 paid out of the same amount \u2013 for national parliaments, enabling them to better discharge their monitoring function together with the watchdogs.\nAnother proposal is that businesses found to have been involved in corruption in respect of projects in developing countries should thereafter be excluded from European tenders. Here too, I propose the compilation of a blacklist of such businesses. Those who can show that there has been improvement, through, for example, changes in management, would get a second chance and could be removed from the list.\nFinally, all Member States of the EU must delay no longer in ratifying the UN\u2019s anti-corruption treaty, which dates back to 2003. At present, only two of them have done so: France and Hungary. That state of affairs must change. This treaty is the first international agreement to use international law as a means of combating corruption, by, for example, preventing and penalising money-laundering, promptly freezing financial assets held in banks overseas, and seizing those assets where corruption is proven.\nSuch are some of the proposals I have put forward in my report. They represent, of course, only a couple of steps that Europe can take in addressing the enormous problem that corruption presents to society, but let us \u2013 the Commission, Parliament and the Member States \u2013 make them a priority, so that we no longer merely point the finger at the developing countries, but also own up to our own wrongdoing. I will be interested to hear how the Commission responds to these practical proposals, for, remember: \u2018it takes two to tango\u2019.", "lang": "NL", "original": "Margrietus van den Berg (PSE), rapporteur . \u2013 Voorzitter, commissaris, ik ben verheugd dat wij vandaag in dit Parlement een serieus debat voeren over een onderwerp dat niet altijd even gemakkelijk bespreekbaar is geweest in een discours over ontwikkelingssamenwerking. Europa is de grootste donor ter wereld in kwantitatief opzicht, maar de laatste tijd groeit mondiaal het besef dat de doeltreffendheid van de hulp minstens zo belangrijk is als de kwantiteit.\nDe Verklaring van Parijs over de doeltreffendheid van de hulp uit 2005 vormt een belangrijk ijkpunt voor actie op dit vlak en de Europese Commissie heeft onlangs gevolg aan deze verklaring gegeven door middel van een pakket maatregelen inzake de doeltreffendheid van de hulp, dat we binnenkort in de Commissie ontwikkelingssamenwerking zullen bespreken.\nMijn initiatiefverslag, waarover wij vandaag stemmen, geeft ook een aantal serieuze aanbevelingen om hulp effectiever te maken. Goed bestuur dat gevrijwaard is van corruptie is een belangrijke voorwaarde voor de doeltreffendheid van de hulp. Het voorkomt niet alleen dat hulpgeld aan de strijkstok blijft hangen. Corruptie vormt ook een hinderpaal voor ontwikkeling en drukt onevenredig zwaar op de allerarmste delen van de bevolking. De toegang tot essenti\u00eble diensten, zoals basisonderwijs en basisgezondheidszorg, wordt door corruptie bemoeilijkt en soms zelfs belemmerd.\nCorruptie vormt over de hele wereld een gigantisch probleem. Volgens schattingen van de Wereldbank wordt jaarlijks meer dan 1 biljoen dollar, dat is 1.000 miljard, aan steekpenningen betaald. In Afrika, het armste continent ter wereld, gaat een geschat bedrag van 148 miljard dollar, ongeveer gelijk aan 25 procent van het Afrikaanse BNP, verloren. Bovendien zit corruptie in alle lagen van de samenleving en zijn bijna alle maatschappelijke actoren erbij betrokken: politici, ambtenaren, de media, multinationale ondernemingen en ook de internationale donorgemeenschap. Goed bestuur en doeltreffendheid van hulp zijn de gezamenlijke verantwoordelijkheid van de donorgemeenschap en de ontwikkelingslanden. It takes two to tango . Daarom gaan mijn voorstellen ook concreet over wat wij als Europese Unie, Commissie en lidstaten kunnen doen, liefst in samenwerking met de hele internationale gemeenschap.\nMijn belangrijkste voorstel is het opstellen van een zwarte lijst van corrupte regimes waaraan niet meer geleend mag worden door banken en andere financi\u00eble instellingen. Wie w\u00e9l uitleent aan regeringen die op deze lijst staan, draait zelf voor de eventuele schuld op en kan niet komen aankloppen bij de internationale gemeenschap. Zo voorkomen we dat de bevolking uiteindelijk de dupe wordt van Marcos, Kabila, Abacha of een van hun opvolgers.\nDaarnaast stel ik voor een klein percentage, een half procent, van het bedrag dat rechtstreeks aan de regering van een land wordt uitbetaald in de vorm van begrotingssectorsteun, verplicht te geven aan waakhonden van maatschappelijke organisaties. Deze groepen uit het maatschappelijk middenveld voeren publieke controle uit op de inkomsten en uitgaven van de regering en de resultaten op het stuk van de ontwikkelingsdoelstellingen. Ook moet er steun zijn - en dat kan uit hetzelfde bedrag - aan nationale parlementen opdat zij beter hun controlefunctie samen met die waakhonden kunnen uitoefenen.\nEen volgend voorstel is om bedrijven die betrokken zijn geweest bij corruptie bij projecten in ontwikkelingslanden, in het vervolg uit te sluiten van aanbestedingen vanuit Europa. Ook hier stel ik voor een zwarte lijst aan te leggen waarop deze bedrijven terechtkomen. Wie kan aantonen dat er verbetering is, door bijvoorbeeld aanpassing van het management, krijgt een nieuwe kans en kan van de lijst verdwijnen.\nTot slot moeten alle Europese lidstaten haast maken met het ratificeren van het VN-Verdrag tegen corruptie uit 2003. Momenteel is dit verdrag slechts door twee lidstaten geratificeerd: Frankrijk en Hongarije. Dat moet anders. Dit verdrag is de eerste internationale overeenkomst waarmee internationale rechtsmiddelen worden ingesteld om corruptie aan te pakken. Ik noem daarbij het voorkomen en vervolgen van witwasserij, het in een vroeg stadium bevriezen van financi\u00eble tegoeden bij banken in het buitenland en het terughalen van deze tegoeden bij bewezen vormen van corruptie.\nVoorzitter, dit zijn enkele van de voorstellen die ik in mijn verslag doe. Natuurlijk zijn het slechts een paar stappen die Europa kan zetten in het gigantische probleem dat corruptie voor de samenleving vormt. Laten we hier allemaal - Commissie, Parlement en lidstaten - een prioriteit van maken en niet alleen met de vinger wijzen naar de ontwikkelingslanden, maar ook de hand in eigen boezem steken. Ik ben benieuwd wat de reactie van de Commissie op deze concrete voorstellen is.

Let me start by looking at the debate summary provided. The user mentioned that the speaker is Margrietus van den Berg (PSE). \n\nFirst, I'll scan through the sections of the debate summary to find any mentions of van den Berg. In the \"Key Issues Identified\" section, there's a mention of van den Berg citing World Bank estimates about corruption. Then, in the \"Positions and Arguments\" section, it says that Margrietus van den Berg argued that \"it takes two to tango,\" emphasizing shared responsibility between donors and recipients. Also, in the \"Major Proposals\" section, van den Berg proposed a black list of corrupt regimes and allocating 0.5% of budget support to civil society watchdogs. Additionally, in the \"Systemic Reform Proposals\" section, there's a mention of van den Berg's proposal for a black list.\n\nSo, the key issues he raised would be the scale of corruption, citing specific figures. His position is that corruption is a shared responsibility between donors and recipients. The arguments he used are the \"two to tango\" analogy, implying both sides are involved. His proposals include the black list and funding civil society organizations. \n\nI need to make sure I don't include other speakers' points. For example, the black list is mentioned as being supported by several speakers, but the proposal itself is attributed to van den Berg. Also, the 0.5% allocation is his proposal. \n\nSo, structuring the JSON: issueSum would cover the financial scale of corruption. positionSum is the shared responsibility. argSum is the \"two to tango\" reasoning. propSum includes the black list and the 0.5% allocation. I should check if there's anything else. The summary also mentions he's part of the PSE group, but that's probably not needed here. \n\nI think that's all.

The user provided a detailed debate summary about aid effectiveness and corruption in developing countries, and they want me to focus on Mariann Fischer Boel's contributions.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the debate summary and find any mentions of Mariann Fischer Boel. From the Executive Summary section, under \"Positions and Arguments,\" there's a part about the Budget Support Debate. It mentions that Commission representative Mariann Fischer Boel defended budget support, stating it \"directly addresses weak public finance management\" and \"strengthens public procurement systems.\" \n\nSo, the key points here are her position on budget support versus project-based aid. She argues that budget support is effective because it tackles public finance management and procurement. There's no mention of her discussing other issues like blacklisting, transparency, or corporate accountability. The user's instruction is to only include points attributed to the specific speaker, so I shouldn't add anything else.\n\nNow, structuring the JSON response. The issueSum should mention budget support as the key issue. The positionSum needs to state her support for budget support. The argumentSum would be her reasoning about addressing public finance management and procurement. There's no mention of proposals beyond her defense of budget support, so propSum might be empty or not applicable. Wait, the example response includes propSum even if it's a proposal. But in the debate summary, she's defending budget support, which is a position, not a new proposal. So maybe propSum isn't applicable here. But the user's example includes propSum even if it's part of the position. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the propSum is \"He advocates for strict limitations on government demands for private data,\" which is part of his position. So maybe in this case, her position is supporting budget support, and the argument is why she thinks it's effective. There's no specific proposal mentioned beyond that. So propSum might be empty. But the user's example includes propSum even if it's part of the position. Hmm.\n\nWait, the user's instructions say: \"You will outline the main points or arguments made by that speaker. Your job is not to summarise the debate. Contributions or arguments from other speakers should not be included in your response.\" So I need to extract exactly what she said. She defended budget support, stating it addresses weak public finance management and strengthens procurement. So the issue is budget support vs project-based aid. Her position is in favor of budget support. The argument is that it addresses public finance management and procurement. There's no specific proposal beyond that, unless \"defending budget support\" is considered a proposal. But the debate summary doesn't mention any new policy proposals from her, just her defense of budget support as a method. Therefore, propSum might not have anything. But the example includes propSum even if it's part of the position. Maybe in this case, the propSum would be her support for budget support. But the example's propSum is a specific action. So perhaps here, there's no proposal mentioned, so propSum is an empty string. Let me check the user's example again. In their example, the propSum is \"He advocates for strict limitations on government demands for private data,\" which is part of his position. So maybe in this case, the propSum would be \"Supporting budget support as a method to address public finance management and strengthen procurement systems.\" But the user's example has propSum as a separate category. Wait, the user's example has:\n\n\"propSum\": \"He advocates for strict limitations on government demands for private data\",\n\nWhich is part of his position. So maybe in this case, the propSum would be her advocating for budget support. However, the original debate summary says she \"defended budget support,\" which is a position, not a proposal. The proposals mentioned in the debate are from other speakers, like blacklisting, civil society support, etc. So perhaps there's no proposal from her. Therefore, propSum would be an empty string. But the user's instructions say to include proposals or policy actions mentioned by the speaker. Since she's defending budget support, which is a policy approach, maybe that's considered a proposal. But the debate summary doesn't present it as a new proposal, just her stance. So I think the correct approach is to have:\n\nissueSum: \"The issue of budget support versus project-based aid in development assistance.\"\npositionSum: \"Supports direct budget support as a means to address weak public finance management and strengthen public procurement systems.\"\nargSum: \"Argues that budget support directly targets weaknesses in public finance management and enhances public procurement systems.\"\npropSum: \"\"\n\nBut I need to check if the user's example includes propSum even if it's part of the position. The example's propSum is part of the position. So maybe in this case, the propSum is \"Supporting budget support as a method to address public finance management and strengthen procurement systems.\" But the user's example's propSum is a specific action, not just a position. So maybe the answer here is that there's no specific proposal, only a position. Therefore, propSum is an empty string.\n\nSo the final JSON would be:\n\n{\n  \"issueSum\": \"The issue of budget support versus project-based aid in development assistance.\",\n  \"positionSum\": \"Supports direct budget support as a means to address weak public finance management and strengthen public procurement systems.\",\n  \"argSum\": \"Argues that budget support directly targets weaknesses in public finance management and enhances public procurement systems.\",\n  \"propSum\": \"\"\n}\n\nBut I need to make sure that the JSON is correctly formatted, with quotes escaped if necessary. However, the user's example uses double quotes, so I need to ensure that the JSON is valid. Also, the user's example has the propSum as a string, even if it's empty. So the final answer should have the above structure.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The issue of budget support versus project-based aid in development assistance.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"Supports direct budget support as a means to address weak public finance management and strengthen public procurement systems.\",\n\"argSum\": \"Argues that budget support directly targets weaknesses in public finance management and enhances public procurement systems.\",\n\"propSum\": \"\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Nirj Deva,", "english": "Nirj Deva, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . \u2013 Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating my colleague Mr van den Berg on an excellent and valuable report.

The EU, and its Member States, contributes over half of public aid to development, overall. Following the decisions taken by the 2005 Spring European Council and the Gleneagles G8 Summit, international aid is set to increase substantially over the next ten years.\nIn this context, if we are to properly accomplish the Millennium Goals, appropriate transparency mechanisms must be brought in to ensure that development aid actually reaches the people on the ground it is designed to help. As the van den Berg report says, the appropriate management of development aid is essential to the good governance of the recipient countries. I should like to turn to the example of Ethiopia, where despite the fact that it is the largest recipient of external aid, which accounts for almost 25% of the country's public budget, there have nevertheless been serious breakdowns in the rule of law, democracy and human rights.\nPursuant to Articles 96 and 97 of the revised Cotonou Agreement, serious cases of corruption can lead to political consultations. The EU should not hold back from using this tool. Naturally, in the medium and long term, it is crucial to foster a dynamic civil society with a free, balanced press. This is the only way in which the citizens of developing countries will be able to expose corrupt governments and to free themselves from them. On a more practical level, the EU must bring pressure to bear on the parliaments and governments of developing countries to step up control over military spending.\nShadow and parallel budgets are in themselves a form of corruption, directly affecting internal, regional and even global security. The lack of transparency in this area is a clear example of the link between corruption, bankrupt countries and security. In other words, when we speak of corruption, we also speak of war and peace, and as such the problem is not confined to developing countries, given that our own EU and western governments more often than not have a part to play in this. The G8 countries, for example, are responsible for more than 80% of world arms exports.\nI welcome the efforts made by EU Member States towards ensuring the compatibility of arms exports from the Union with the technical and economic capacity of importing countries under the EU\u2019s Code of Conduct on Arms Exports. It is vital to guarantee that money for development is not diverted towards arms. Unfortunately, we are still awaiting detailed reports from the Member States on the implementation of the rules of this code.\nIn this murky area of arms, corruption and violence, Europe has a responsibility to guarantee that the arms sold by European companies and by European governments reach their legal recipients, and only them, and do not fall into the hands of criminals, militias and repressive governments. The partial implementation by Member States, including my country, of the 2003 European Council common position on arms brokering means that there remain legal loopholes in this area in Europe. Unless we start being tougher on arms control within our own borders, it will be difficult to combat corruption in this area in developing countries.", "lang": "PT", "original": "Ana Maria Gomes, em nome do Grupo PSE . \u2013 Senhor Presidente, antes de mais, queria saudar o meu colega Max van den Berg pelo excelente, oportuno e importante relat\u00f3rio que elaborou. A Uni\u00e3o Europeia e os seus membros contribuem com mais de metade da ajuda p\u00fablica ao desenvolvimento, globalmente. Na sequ\u00eancia das decis\u00f5es tomadas no Conselho Europeu da Primavera de 2005 e na Cimeira do G8 de Gleneagles, a ajuda internacional deve aumentar substancialmente nos pr\u00f3ximos dez anos.\nNeste contexto, e para atingirmos realmente os objectivos do Mil\u00e9nio, \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio introduzir mecanismos apropriados de transpar\u00eancia para assegurar que a ajuda ao desenvolvimento chegue efectivamente aos destinat\u00e1rios no terreno.

Lembro o exemplo da Eti\u00f3pia, um pa\u00eds ACP, o maior destinat\u00e1rio da ajuda externa, onde ela representa quase 25% do or\u00e7amento p\u00fablico e onde, no entanto, se verificam s\u00e9rias pervers\u00f5es do Estado de direito, da democracia e dos direitos humanos.\nDe acordo com o Acordo de Cotonu revisto, casos s\u00e9rios de corrup\u00e7\u00e3o podem resultar em consultas pol\u00edticas nos termos dos artigos 96\u00b0 e 97\u00b0. A Uni\u00e3o Europeia n\u00e3o devia inibir-se de usar esta ferramenta. Claro que, a m\u00e9dio e longo prazo, o est\u00edmulo de uma sociedade civil, din\u00e2mica, com uma imprensa livre e equilibrada \u00e9 fundamental. S\u00f3 assim os cidad\u00e3os e as cidad\u00e3s dos pa\u00edses em desenvolvimento ter\u00e3o a possibilidade de expor e de se libertar de governos corruptos. Mais concretamente, a Uni\u00e3o Europeia deve exercer press\u00e3o sobre os parlamentos e governos dos pa\u00edses em desenvolvimento para que aumentem o controlo parlamentar dos gastos militares.\nOr\u00e7amentos-sombra e paralelos representam uma forma de corrup\u00e7\u00e3o que afecta directamente a seguran\u00e7a interna, regional e at\u00e9 global.

Por outras palavras, quando falamos de corrup\u00e7\u00e3o, tamb\u00e9m falamos de guerra e paz e, neste quadro, o problema n\u00e3o est\u00e1 s\u00f3 nos pa\u00edses em desenvolvimento, j\u00e1 que os nossos governos na Uni\u00e3o Europeia e no Ocidente em geral t\u00eam a sua quota-parte de responsabilidade. Os pa\u00edses do G8, por exemplo, s\u00e3o respons\u00e1veis por mais de 80% das exporta\u00e7\u00f5es mundiais de armas.\nS\u00e3o positivos os esfor\u00e7os envidados pelos Estados-Membros da Uni\u00e3o Europeia para garantir a compatibilidade das exporta\u00e7\u00f5es de armas da Uni\u00e3o com a capacidade t\u00e9cnica e econ\u00f3mica dos pa\u00edses importadores no contexto do c\u00f3digo de conduta para a exporta\u00e7\u00e3o de armas da Uni\u00e3o Europeia.

The user provided a detailed parliamentary debate summary about aid effectiveness and corruption, and they want me to extract the main points from Ana Gomes' speech.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the debate summary and find any mentions of Ana Gomes. Scanning through the sections, under the \"Key Issues Identified\" and \"Positions and Arguments\" parts, there's a mention of Ana Gomes. The summary says she connected arms exports to corruption, noting that G8 countries account for over 80% of global arms exports. \n\nNow, I need to structure this into the required JSON format. The user specified that only the points attributed to Ana Gomes should be included. The issue she raised is about arms exports being linked to corruption. Her position is that G8 countries are responsible because of their high share of arms exports. The argument here is that arms exports contribute to corruption, and the proposal would be addressing this by holding G8 countries accountable. \n\nWait, the original summary doesn't mention any specific proposals from Ana Gomes beyond the arms export point. The \"propSum\" should be about her proposals. But in the provided debate summary, under \"Major Proposals,\" there's a mention of her connecting arms exports to corruption, but no direct proposal from her. However, the user's example includes a proposal even if it's implied. But according to the instructions, I should only include what's attributed to her. Since the summary states she \"connected arms exports to corruption,\" that's her argument. There's no explicit proposal mentioned for her, so maybe propSum is empty. But the example given in the user's prompt includes a propSum even if it's a suggestion. Hmm.\n\nWait, the user's example has \"He advocates for strict limitations...\" which is a proposal. In the case of Ana Gomes, the summary says she \"noted that G8 countries bear responsibility as they account for over 80% of global arms exports.\" That's more of a statement of responsibility rather than a proposal. So maybe there's no specific proposal from her. Therefore, propSum would be an empty string. \n\nSo, putting it all together: issueSum is about arms exports and corruption, positionSum is her assertion of G8's responsibility, argSum is the basis of her argument (their share of arms exports), and propSum is nothing. But I need to check if there's any other mention. Let me double-check the debate summary.\n\nLooking again, under \"Positions and Arguments,\" it says \"Ana Gomes connected arms exports to corruption, noting that 'G8 countries bear responsibility as they account for over 80% of global arms exports.'\" So that's her argument. There's no mention of a proposal from her. Therefore, propSum would be empty. \n\nSo the JSON should have:\n\nissueSum: \"The issue raised by Ana Gomes relates to the role of arms exports in enabling corruption, particularly highlighting the responsibility of G8 countries.\"\npositionSum: \"Ana Gomes asserted that G8 countries bear responsibility for corruption due to their dominance in global arms exports.\"\nargSum: \"Her argument is based on the fact that G8 countries account for over 80% of global arms exports, suggesting a link between arms exports and corrupt practices.\"\npropSum: \"\"\n\nBut the user's example has propSum even if it's a suggestion. However, since the debate summary doesn't mention any specific proposal from Ana Gomes beyond her statement, I should leave propSum as an empty string. The user's instructions say if there are no points, respond with empty string. So that's correct.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The issue raised by Ana Gomes relates to the role of arms exports in enabling corruption, particularly highlighting the responsibility of G8 countries.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"Ana Gomes asserted that G8 countries bear responsibility for corruption due to their dominance in global arms exports.\",\n\"argSum\": \"Her argument is based on the fact that G8 countries account for over 80% of global arms exports, suggesting a link between arms exports and corrupt practices.\",\n\"propSum\": \"\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Marios Matsakis,", "english": "Marios Matsakis, on behalf of the ALDE Group . \u2013 Mr President, many congratulations to Mr\u00a0van den Berg for his excellent report.

He is going to be showered with praise as a result, which is something at least. It is clear that the fight against corruption is absolutely crucial, in terms not only of the effectiveness of European aid, but also of its credibility. How can we really convince our fellow citizens or the Member States to give more if corruption remains endemic? This is also the condition of the viability of a constitutional State and of an economy. This is therefore a crucial battle that we must fight to the end, one that has become somewhat more complex with the advent of economic globalisation, due to the ease with which capital can be moved and also due to the new budgetary aid process at EU level.\nThe rapporteur does a good job of highlighting all of the questions posed by this new budgetary aid system with regard to the fight against corruption, as well as the heightened problem, in the present context, resulting from the increased pressure put on raw materials and, in particular, on scarce oil supplies. There is therefore also reason to fear both a resurgence of attempts at corruption for the purposes of gaining access to the last remaining fossil fuel reserves and an increase in conflicts linked to the trade and traffic in weapons. Weapons and oil are in fact the two large sectors, in the macroeconomy, in which a high level of corruption is developing.\nThe rapporteur therefore rightly emphasises two issues: transparency and responsibility. Transparency, in actual fact, is a crucial element if one is to have a precise and clear idea of the budgets that are used. In this field, we must be far more enthusiastic in our support of a number of initiatives, such as \u2018Publish What You Pay\u2019 or the initiative of the extractive industries, which nevertheless have the disadvantage of being based solely on voluntary participation. We need to make progress in this area of legislation rather than merely to rely on the good will of economic or political actors to publish, if they so wish, the funds or loans that they give to the governments concerned.\nThe budgetisation of the revenue from oil and mining is also a crucial aspect of budgetary transparency but, as far as the European Union is concerned, this must be a requirement so that budgetary aid cannot be granted to a government that does not clearly publish the profits that it makes from the oil, mining or forestry industries. Public opinion cannot understand why the European Union continues helping countries that should, by rights, have a sizeable budget and one that is able to finance the smooth running of a State.\nFinally, the report points out that a government\u2019s military expenditure must also be published. The role of national parliaments and of civil society simply must be strengthened, in financial terms too, by means of increased support enabling both parliaments and civil society to play their role in this area.\nMy final point concerns transparency with regard to the various donors. The governments of these countries are also helped by towns, regions or States, at all levels, and we lack a database that would indicate what is really paid by a given country to a given State, region or town. We do not have access to that information today, and that also fuels corruption.\nTo conclude, I therefore believe that we need to put matters in order, as has been said, and that corruption cases, too, form part of the current issues facing the European Union. The issue of exercising power and of funding political life is as relevant in the North as it is in the South.", "lang": "FR", "original": "Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Aubert, au nom du groupe Verts/ALE . - Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, je voudrais \u00e0 mon tour remercier Margrietus van den Berg pour son excellent rapport. Il va \u00eatre ainsi couvert de lauriers, c\u2019est d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e7a. Il est clair que la lutte contre la corruption est absolument essentielle, non seulement pour l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 de l\u2019aide europ\u00e9enne mais aussi pour sa cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9. En effet, comment convaincre nos concitoyens ou les \u00c9tats membres de donner plus si, par ailleurs, la corruption reste end\u00e9mique? C\u2019est aussi la condition de la viabilit\u00e9 d\u2019un \u00c9tat de droit et d\u2019une \u00e9conomie. C\u2019est donc un combat essentiel que nous devons mener en permanence, lequel s\u2019est quelque peu complexifi\u00e9 avec la mondialisation \u00e9conomique, en raison de la circulation facile des capitaux, et aussi en raison du nouveau processus de l\u2019aide budg\u00e9taire au niveau de l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne.\nLe rapporteur souligne bien toutes les questions que pose ce nouveau syst\u00e8me d\u2019aide budg\u00e9taire en mati\u00e8re de lutte contre la corruption, ainsi que la difficult\u00e9 accrue, dans le contexte actuel, \u00e0 cause de la pression croissante exerc\u00e9e sur les mati\u00e8res premi\u00e8res et, en particulier, sur l\u2019\u00e9nergie p\u00e9troli\u00e8re qui se rar\u00e9fie. On peut donc \u00e9galement craindre une r\u00e9surgence des tentatives de corruption en vue d\u2019acc\u00e9der aux derniers gisements d\u2019\u00e9nergie fossile, ainsi qu\u2019une mont\u00e9e des conflits li\u00e9s au commerce et au trafic des armes. Les armes et le p\u00e9trole sont tout de m\u00eame les deux grands secteurs, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelle macro\u00e9conomique, dans lesquels se d\u00e9veloppe une corruption consid\u00e9rable.\nAlors le rapporteur insiste \u00e0 juste titre sur deux questions: la transparence et la responsabilit\u00e9. La transparence, en effet, est un \u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel si l\u2019on veut se faire une id\u00e9e pr\u00e9cise et claire des budgets qui sont utilis\u00e9s. Dans ce domaine, effectivement, nous devons soutenir beaucoup plus ardemment un certain nombre d\u2019initiatives comme Publish what you pay ou l\u2019initiative des industries extractives, qui pr\u00e9sentent cependant l\u2019inconv\u00e9nient d\u2019\u00eatre bas\u00e9es uniquement sur le volontariat. Or, nous avons besoin de faire des progr\u00e8s dans le domaine du droit, de la loi plut\u00f4t que de nous contenter de compter sur la bonne volont\u00e9 des acteurs \u00e9conomiques ou politiques pour publier, s\u2019ils le souhaitent, les comptes ou les rentes qu\u2019ils versent aux gouvernements concern\u00e9s.\nLa budg\u00e9tisation des rentes p\u00e9troli\u00e8res et des rentes mini\u00e8res est aussi un aspect essentiel de la transparence budg\u00e9taire, mais de la part de l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne, cela doit \u00eatre une condition pour qu\u2019on ne puisse pas verser une aide budg\u00e9taire \u00e0 un gouvernement qui ne publie pas clairement les profits qu\u2019il d\u00e9gage des industries p\u00e9troli\u00e8res, mini\u00e8res ou foresti\u00e8res.

There is no doubt that rooting out corruption is a key objective if we want to ensure the effectiveness of aid, and Mr van den Berg has outlined the instruments needed to make that possible: transparency, participation and responsibility.\nThe role of parliaments and civil society is crucial, and more transparent procedures and the circulation of information are vital. Furthermore, it is requested that all of the social actors become more involved in the process of defining anti-poverty strategies, which still attract little participation, even at national level. Finally, specific funding is necessary in order to monitor the cooperation measures.\nI believe that it is impossible to talk about corruption in developing countries without looking at the other side of the coin: to what extent are we, as developed countries, responsible for their corruption and what benefit do we derive from it? Mr\u00a0Matsakis gave some very precise examples; this in no way means easing the pressure on the actual corruption of many leaders and governments of developing countries and, at times, of NGOs too.\nThe fight against corruption in recipient countries must also be extended to corrupting companies belonging to industrialised countries, and the fight against \u2018corrupt corruptors\u2019 should be conducted as part of an effective and transparent partnership. The institutions of donor countries located in recipient countries must commit themselves to fighting the phenomenon on the ground, by singling out corrupting companies and banishing them to whichever country they belong, as Mr\u00a0van den Berg also said, and they must have the courage to act even when corruption is lurking in our own institutions on the ground. In addition to being a moral matter, the cost of corruption is a cost that everyone must bear, including European taxpayers.\nUntying aid is another crucial aspect of the relationship between corruption and aid effectiveness. Untied aid \u2013 which is necessary for ethical reasons \u2013 guarantees greater transparency in relation to procedures and to the awarding and management of tenders, and would also increase the value of aid. The figures are quite clear: tied aid causes an average increase in the cost of goods and services of between 15% and 30%, rising to as much as 40% for food aid.\nIt would be helpful if we could also come up with an appropriate definition of ODA. I believe that official development aid, which is often swollen by massive sums for debt cancellation, for peace keeping, peace enforcing and conflict prevention efforts, for repatriating immigrants and for controlling borders, must not be changed.\nIn this kind of scenario, budget aid can become an important support channel to the poorest, most heavily indebted countries, for the purposes of eradicating poverty and of attaining the Millennium Development Goals. Nevertheless, I believe that it is crucial \u2013 as, moreover, it is claimed in the tripartite document on the European consensus on development policy \u2013 that the governments of the Member States and the European institutions try to coordinate themselves and harmonise their own policies, including within international financial institutions, with a view to becoming not only the leading donors in the world, but also the most responsible of donors and the most incisive when it comes to drafting policies that put an end to the spiralling external debt in the South of the world, thus helping to eradicate poverty and, if I may be so bold, to eliminate a little injustice, too, and perhaps even wars.", "lang": "IT", "original": "Luisa Morgantini, a nome del gruppo GUE/NGL . \u2013 Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, reputo ottimo l\u2019intervento dell\u2019onorevole van den Berg. Non c\u2019\u00e8 dubbio: sconfiggere la corruzione \u00e8 un obiettivo centrale se si vuole garantire l\u2019efficacia degli aiuti e van den Berg ha esplicitato gli strumenti necessari affinch\u00e9 ci\u00f2 sia possibile: trasparenza, partecipazione e responsabilit\u00e0.\nE\u2019 fondamentale il ruolo di parlamenti e societ\u00e0 civile e sono indispensabili delle procedure pi\u00f9 trasparenti e la diffusione delle informazioni. Inoltre \u00e8 richiesta una maggiore presenza di tutti gli attori sociali nel processo di definizione di strategie per la lotta contro la povert\u00e0, ancora poco partecipate, anche a livello nazionale. In ultimo, sono necessari dei fondi specifici per monitorare le azioni di cooperazione.\nCredo che non si possa parlare della corruzione dei PVS senza vedere l\u2019altra faccia della medaglia: quanto siamo responsabili noi, paesi sviluppati, della loro corruzione, qual \u00e8 il vantaggio che noi ne ricaviamo? L\u2019onorevole Matsakis ha dato esempi molto precisi, questo non significa assolutamente alleggerire la pressione sull\u2019effettiva corruzione di molti dirigenti e governi dei PVS e, a volte, anche delle ONG.\nLa lotta alla corruzione nei paesi beneficiari deve essere estesa anche alle imprese corruttrici appartenenti ai paesi industrializzati, e la lotta contro i \u201ccorrotti corruttori\u201d dovrebbe essere condotta nel quadro di una partnership efficace e trasparente. Le istituzioni dei paesi donatori presenti nei paesi beneficiari devono impegnarsi a combattere il fenomeno in loco, con l\u2019individuazione e la messa al bando \u2013 e lo dice anche l\u2019onorevole van den Berg \u2013 delle imprese corruttrici, a qualsiasi paese esse appartengano, avendo il coraggio di agire anche quando la corruzione si annida nelle nostre istituzioni in loco. Oltre che ad essere un fatto morale, il costo della corruzione \u00e8 un costo per tutti, anche per i tax payer europei.\nSlegare gli aiuti \u00e8 un altro aspetto cruciale della relazione tra corruzione ed efficacia dell\u2019aiuto. L\u2019aiuto slegato \u2013 doveroso per motivi etici \u2013 garantisce una maggiore trasparenza di procedure, di assegnazione e condotta delle gare, e aumenterebbe anche l\u2019entit\u00e0 degli aiuti. Le cifre parlano chiaro: l\u2019aiuto legato determina un aumento medio dei costi di beni e servizi dal 15 al 30 per cento, arrivando fino al 40 per cento per l\u2019aiuto alimentare.\nSarebbe auspicabile anche arrivare a una corretta definizione dell\u2019APS. Credo che l\u2019aiuto pubblico allo sviluppo \u2013 spesso gonfiato con massicce somme per la cancellazione del debito, per azioni di peace keeping , peace enforcing e conflict prevention , rimpatrio di emigrati e controlli alle frontiere \u2013 non debba essere modificato.\nIn uno scenario di questo tipo, gli aiuti al bilancio possono divenire un canale di sostegno importante ai paesi pi\u00f9 poveri e fortemente indebitati, ai fini della lotta alla povert\u00e0 e per il raggiungimento degli Obiettivi di sviluppo del Millennio. Tuttavia, credo che sia cruciale \u2013 come del resto asserito nel documento tripartito sul consenso europeo per le politiche di sviluppo \u2013 che i governi degli Stati membri e le Istituzioni europee cerchino di coordinarsi ed armonizzare le proprie politiche anche all\u2019interno delle istituzioni finanziarie internazionali, per arrivare ad essere non solo i maggiori donatori al mondo, ma anche i pi\u00f9 responsabili tra i donatori e i pi\u00f9 incisivi nella determinazione di politiche che mettano fine alla spirale di crescita del debito estero nel sud del mondo, contribuendo alla sconfitta delle povert\u00e0 e, perch\u00e9 no, anche alla sconfitta di un po\u2019 di ingiustizie e forse anche delle guerre.", "agenda_item": "Aid effectiveness and corruption in developing countries (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060406-ITEM-005", "intervention_id": "4-033", "summary_english": "{\n\"headline\": \"Fight Against Corruption Must Include Donor Countries and Companies, Not Just Recipients\",\n\"issueSum\": \"The speaker addresses corruption in developing countries as a barrier to aid effectiveness, emphasizing the need for transparency, participation and responsibility.

I believe that aid is an important tool in this fight for a better world. The EU\u2019s aid policy is in itself very poor. However, it is undermined by other policy areas too. Firstly, the EU conducts an agricultural policy in which absurd subsidies are given to relatively rich farmers. This, together with the duties that the EU imposes on agricultural products from poor countries, leads to a situation in which agricultural policy actively militates against aid.\nSecondly, the EU\u2019s trade policy leads to poor countries being deprived of the ability to enter our market with their competitive products. A topical and instructive example of this type of damaging protectionism is the EU\u2019s recent imposition of duties on shoes from, for example, Vietnam. Thirdly and lastly, I believe that development cooperation should take place at Member State level. If aid is to be as effective as possible, it is, of course, always crucially important that efforts be coordinated.\nThis coordination should, however, take place at UN level where donors from all over the world, and not only from the EU, work together in order to bring about effective aid which, as a matter of actual fact, leads to a reduction in poverty.

So propSum would be empty. \n\nWait, the example response has propSum even if there's nothing, but the user said if there are no points, respond with an empty string. So I need to check if Dillen made any proposals. The summary only mentions his warning about blank checks, no proposals.

Ana Gomes connected arms exports to corruption, noting that 'G8 countries bear responsibility as they account for over 80% of global arms exports.'\"\n\nWait, but the user is asking about Michael Gahler.

Also, in the \"Major Proposals\" section, there's a mention: \"Gahler suggested 'changing tax laws to prevent companies from deducting bribes as business expenses,' while Zimmer called for 'making bribery payments criminal offenses in all EU member states.'\"\n\nSo Michael Gahler's contributions are two-fold: one about banks holding funds from dictators and another about changing tax laws to prevent bribe deductions. \n\nNow, structuring this into the required JSON format.

Just how necessary it is that action be taken to deal with this is spelled out by the African Union\u2019s estimates according to which corruption robs the African national economies of some USD 150 billion per annum, amounting to one-quarter of their gross domestic product.\nI would like to start with the very same aspect to which Mr Gahler referred \u2013 the highlighting of the need for action on our part even when it hurts us the most. Bribes to the tune of a billion are paid every year \u2013 by whom? Who is it that regards the payment of this sort of money as an investment and remits it to closely-guarded accounts in the expectation of even greater profits? Important though it is to urge our partners to combat corruption and support them in doing so, our primary task should be to take off the field those in our own countries who are capable of paying such massive sums in bribes in the first place and using them to ruin Africa and other parts of the world.\nI want to explicitly highlight Article 15 of the UN Convention against Corruption, according to which the Member States of the European Union must make bribery a criminal offence. In my own country, Germany, it was until recently the case that bribes could be set off against tax, and people can still not be punished for paying them.\nWe in this House should sweep away this foul-smelling filth from in front of our own front doors first. Like you, like everyone on the Development Committee, I support the \u2018publish what you pay\u2019 campaign and would go as far as to demand that multinational companies be compelled to make public information on the payments they make to governments.\nAmong the others who profit from bribery and to whose activities we must put a stop are those banks that offer their services in completing such transactions and can rejoice in accounts full to overflowing with bribes. This cannot be permitted within the EU, and so we should call on the EU and its Member States to cut off the channels for slush money outside its borders as well. When we have criminalised bribery here at home, when our own standard of living is no longer financed even in part by the profits of corruption, when we no longer sing the praises of our banking houses for making profits from the management of corruption and when we equip our investigating agencies with the wherewithal to chase after those who pay bribes \u2013 then will we be able to stand tall before our partners and bid them make the same contribution towards combating corruption.", "lang": "DE", "original": "Gabriele Zimmer (GUE/NGL). \u2013 Herr Pr\u00e4sident! Herr van den Berg, auch von meiner Seite herzlichen Gl\u00fcckwunsch zu Ihrem Bericht, mit dem Sie eines der hei\u00dfesten Eisen der Entwicklungszusammenarbeit angepackt haben. Die Sch\u00e4tzungen der Afrikanischen Union, wonach die afrikanischen Volkswirtschaften durch Korruption j\u00e4hrlich etwa 150 Milliarden Dollar verlieren, also ein Viertel ihres Bruttoinlandproduktes, machen den Handlungszwang deutlich.\nIch m\u00f6chte genau an demselben Aspekt ansetzen, den auch schon Herr Gahler genannt hat, n\u00e4mlich den Handlungszwang von unserer Seite auch dort zu benennen, wo er uns selbst am meisten wehtut. Eine Milliarde Bestechungsgelder werden j\u00e4hrlich gezahlt. Von wem? Wer betrachtet die Zahlung dieser Gelder als Investitionen, die in der berechtigten Erwartung noch gr\u00f6\u00dferer Gewinne auf gesch\u00fctzte Konten \u00fcberwiesen werden? So wichtig es ist, unsere Partner zur Bek\u00e4mpfung der Korruption aufzufordern und sie dabei zu unterst\u00fctzen, unsere prim\u00e4re Aufgabe sollte doch sein, diejenigen aus dem Verkehr zu ziehen, die in unseren L\u00e4ndern diese gewaltigen Bestechungssummen \u00fcberhaupt erst aufbringen k\u00f6nnen und sie nutzen, um den afrikanischen Kontinent und andere Teile der Welt auszunehmen.\nIch verweise hier bewusst auf Artikel 15 der UN-Konvention gegen Korruption. Danach m\u00fcssen die Mitgliedstaaten der Europ\u00e4ischen Union Bestechung strafbar machen. In meinem Land, in Deutschland, war es vor kurzem noch so, dass man die Bestechungsgelder von der Steuer absetzen konnte, und strafbar sind sie bis heute nicht.\nAls Parlament sollten wir genau diesen \u00fcbel riechenden Mist zuerst vor unserer eigenen Haust\u00fcr wegkehren. Ich unterst\u00fctze mit Ihnen und dem gesamten Entwicklungsausschuss ausdr\u00fccklich die Kampagne \u201e Publish what you pay\u201c und fordere sogar zwingende Regelungen f\u00fcr multinationale Unternehmen, Informationen \u00fcber Zahlungen an Regierungen offen zu legen.\nWeitere Profiteure von Bestechung, denen wir in unserem direkten Einflussbereich das Handwerk legen m\u00fcssen, sind Banken, die sich f\u00fcr die Abwicklung solcher Gesch\u00e4fte hergeben und sich auch \u00fcber prall gef\u00fcllte Bestechungskonten freuen k\u00f6nnen. Dies kann innerhalb der Union nicht zugelassen werden. Wir sollten also die Union und ihre Mitgliedstaaten auffordern, die Schlupfl\u00f6cher des Bestechungsgeldes auch au\u00dferhalb der Union zu schlie\u00dfen. Wenn wir bei uns selbst das Bestechen strafbar gemacht haben, wenn wir unseren Lebensstandard nicht l\u00e4nger auch durch Korruptionsgewinne teilfinanzieren, wenn wir unsere korruptionsverwaltenden Bankh\u00e4user nicht l\u00e4nger f\u00fcr ihre so gewonnene Bonit\u00e4t loben und wenn wir unseren Ermittlern die Mittel in die Hand geben, die Bestecher zu jagen, dann k\u00f6nnen wir auch aufrecht vor unsere Partner treten und den gleichen Beitrag zur Bek\u00e4mpfung der Korruption fordern.", "agenda_item": "Aid effectiveness and corruption in developing countries (debate)", "debate_id": "CRE-20060406-ITEM-005", "intervention_id": "4-039", "summary_english": "{\n\"headline\": \"EU Must Address Corruption by Criminalizing Bribery and Stopping European Companies from Paying Bribes to Developing Countries\",\n\"issueSum\": \"The speaker addresses corruption in developing countries, highlighting that the African Union estimates corruption costs African economies $150 billion annually (one-quarter of their GDP).

The user provided a detailed parliamentary debate summary about aid effectiveness and corruption, and they want me to focus on Gabriele Zimmer's contributions. \n\nFirst, I need to go through the debate summary and find all mentions of Gabriele Zimmer. The user specified that I should only include points attributed to her, so I need to be careful not to include others.\n\nLooking at the \"Positions and Arguments\" section, there's a mention of Gabriele Zimmer saying, \"Als Parlament sollten wir genau diesen \u00fcbel riechenden Mist zuerst vor unserer eigenen Haust\u00fcr wegkehren\" which translates to \"As Parliament, we should first sweep away this foul-smelling mess from our own doorstep.\" That's her position on addressing corruption within the EU first.\n\nIn the \"Major Proposals\" section, under transparency requirements, Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Aubert is mentioned, but then there's a part where Zimmer is noted in the context of corporate accountability. Wait, no, the user's example response includes \"corporate accountability\" but in the debate summary, the specific proposals for corporate accountability are mentioned under Michael Gahler and others. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, in the \"Positions and Arguments\" section, the user's example response includes \"corporate accountability\" but in the provided debate summary, the specific mention of Zimmer is in the \"Positions and Arguments\" part. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the \"Positions and Arguments\" section: \"Gabriele Zimmer stressed that 'Als Parlament sollten wir genau diesen \u00fcbel riechenden Mist zuerst vor unserer eigenen Haust\u00fcr wegkehren' (As Parliament, we should first sweep away this foul-smelling mess from our own doorstep).\" So her main point is about the EU's own corruption before focusing on others.\n\nIn the \"Major Proposals\" section, under \"Corporate Accountability,\" the speakers mentioned are Gahler and Zimmer. Wait, the text says: \"Gahler suggested 'changing tax laws to prevent companies from deducting bribes as business expenses,' while Zimmer called for 'making bribery payments criminal offenses in all EU member states.'\" So Zimmer's proposal here is to criminalize bribery payments in EU member states.\n\nSo, for Gabriele Zimmer, the key points are:\n\n- Position: Emphasized that the EU must address its own corruption before expecting others to do so.\n- Argument: The EU has taught corrupt practices to others, so they need to clean their own house first.\n- Proposal: Making bribery payments criminal offenses in all EU member states.\n\nAdditionally, in the \"Implementation Mechanisms\" section, there's a mention of Zimmer in the context of the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention, but the user's example response doesn't include that. Wait, the user's example response includes \"propSum\" as a proposal. So I need to check if Zimmer proposed anything else.\n\nLooking back, the debate summary under \"Major Proposals\" mentions Zimmer's call for making bribery payments criminal offenses. So that's a proposal. Also, in the \"Positions and Arguments,\" her statement about the EU's own corruption.\n\nSo structuring the JSON:\n\nissueSum: The issue is the need for the EU to address its own corruption before focusing on others.\n\npositionSum: She argued that the EU should tackle its own corruption first, as it has contributed to corruption in other countries.\n\nargSum: Her argument is based on the EU's role in teaching corrupt practices to developing countries, hence the need to clean up their own house first.\n\npropSum: She proposed making bribery payments criminal offenses in all EU member states.\n\nI need to make sure that these points are all attributed to her and not others. The user's example response has four fields, so I'll structure accordingly. Also, check if there are any other points. The debate summary also mentions her in the \"Positions and Arguments\" section, but no other proposals.

The speakers listed in the summary include people like Margrietus van den Berg, Mairead McGuinness, Gabriele Zimmer, Mariann Fischer Boel, Koenraad Dillen, Michael Gahler, Ana Gomes, Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Aubert, etc. But the user is asking about Bastiaan Belder, who isn't mentioned in the provided materials.\n\nSo, the user's instruction says that if there are no points attributed to the speaker, I should respond with an empty string.

But the user also says \"You will structure your response as json with the following structure...\". So perhaps the user expects a JSON object, but with empty strings. But the user's example shows that when there are points, the JSON is filled. So maybe in this case, since there's no info, the answer is an empty JSON object.

So perhaps the user made a mistake, but according to the instructions, if there's no info, return an empty string. Therefore, the answer is an empty string. But how to represent that as JSON.

This is conflicting. However, given the user's instruction, I'll proceed to return an empty string. But in JSON, an empty string is \"\" but the structure requires a JSON object. This is a bit of a problem. However, given the ambiguity, perhaps the correct approach is to return an empty JSON object, as that's the structure specified. But the user's instruction says to return an empty string. To comply with the user's explicit instruction, even if it's conflicting, I'll return an empty string. But in JSON, that would be \"}\". Wait, no. An empty string is \"\", but the user's example shows a JSON object. So perhaps the user expects the JSON object with empty strings. But the user's instruction says to return an empty string. This is confusing. However, given the user's exact wording, I'll return an empty string.

The user provided a parliamentary debate summary about aid effectiveness and corruption, and they want me to extract the main points from Marek Aleksander Czarnecki's speech. First, I need to check if there's any mention of him in the debate summary.\n\nLooking through the provided debate summary, under the \"Major Proposals\" section, there's a mention of \"Van den Berg proposed creating 'a black list of corrupt regimes...' and excluding corrupt companies from European procurement. This approach was supported by several speakers including Marek Czarnecki.\" So, Czarnecki is mentioned as supporting the blacklisting mechanism.\n\nNow, the user's instruction is to outline the main points or arguments made by the specific speaker. Since the summary only mentions that he supported the blacklisting proposal, I need to structure that into the JSON fields. \n\nThe \"issueSum\" should mention the issue of corruption and the need for blacklisting. The \"positionSum\" would state his support for the blacklisting approach. The \"argSum\" might not have specific arguments mentioned, but since the summary doesn't detail his reasoning, maybe it's empty. The \"propSum\" would be the proposal itself. \n\nWait, the user said if there are no points, return an empty string. But here, there is one point: supporting the blacklisting. So I need to structure that. The example given in the user's prompt has four fields. Let me check the example again. \n\nIn the example, the response includes issueSum, positionSum, argSum, propSum. For Czarnecki, the only info is that he supported the blacklisting. So:\n\nissueSum: The issue of corruption and the need for mechanisms to exclude corrupt regimes and companies.\npositionSum: Supported the blacklisting of corrupt regimes and companies.\nargSum: Not specified in the summary, so maybe empty.\npropSum: The proposal to create a black list and exclude corrupt entities.\n\nBut the user's example has \"argSum\" as a summary of arguments. Since the debate summary doesn't mention Czarnecki's reasoning, maybe argSum is empty. However, the user's instruction says to only include points attributed to the speaker. Since the summary only mentions his support, but not his arguments, argSum would be empty. \n\nSo the JSON would be:\n\n{\n  \"issueSum\": \"The key issue relates to corruption in developing countries and the need for mechanisms to exclude corrupt regimes and companies from European procurement.\",\n  \"positionSum\": \"Supported the proposal to create a black list of corrupt regimes and exclude corrupt companies from European procurement.\",\n  \"argSum\": \"\",\n  \"propSum\": \"Proposed creating a black list of corrupt regimes that banks and financial institutions cannot lend to, and excluding corrupt companies from European procurement.\"\n}\n\nBut I need to make sure that the \"argSum\" is only included if there are arguments. Since the summary doesn't mention any arguments from Czarnecki, it's empty. The user's example shows that if there's no info, the fields are left as empty strings. So this should be correct.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"issueSum\": \"The key issue relates to corruption in developing countries and the need for mechanisms to exclude corrupt regimes and companies from European procurement.\",\n\"positionSum\": \"Supported the proposal to create a black list of corrupt regimes and exclude corrupt companies from European procurement.\",\n\"argSum\": \"\",\n\"propSum\": \"Proposed creating a black list of corrupt regimes that banks and financial institutions cannot lend to, and excluding corrupt companies from European procurement.\"\n}", "generator_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "generator_model_type": "claude", "generator_grouped": false, "generator_shuffle": false, "generator_prompt": false, "generator_incremental": false, "generator_hierarchical": false, "generator_src_model": "claude"}, {"speaker": "Mairead McGuinness (PPE-DE). \u2013", "english": "Mairead McGuinness (PPE-DE). \u2013 Mr President, last night the word \u2018corruption\u2019 was mentioned several times in our debate on World Health Day 2006.

It is therefore of great practical importance that a society should possess an ethical framework and good practices in order to solve this problem.\nWeak moral principles promote both self-serving transactions and the concealment of those transactions. Those who provide aid are tempted to believe that their money is used for the correct purpose. Those who receive aid often succeed in making us believe that is the case. The corruption that accompanies the granting of aid is especially drastic because the actual people who are in distress suffer doubly. They not only lose the material assistance they should have received, but they are also robbed of the hope to improve their lives and of the hope for solidarity.\nTherefore it is our obligation to consistently expose and, even more importantly, prevent corruption and the gullibility that accompanies it. It is the opinion of the Court of Auditors that the European Commission\u2019s aid programmes do not sufficiently take into consideration the risks of corruption.\nI would like to offer two examples. Firstly, European Union aid to the Palestinian Self-Government. Today we must admit that one of the main reasons the extremist Hamas movement came to power was the previous administration\u2019s deeply rooted corruption. Secondly, the Commission sends humanitarian aid to Chechnya. What has been done to determine whether those funds actually reach the local inhabitants who suffer from official corruption?\nFinally, I would like to emphasise a couple of important points in this very good report. Member States must ratify the UN anti-corruption convention. Secondly, budget support should only be provided to governments which are clearly striving to raise standards for the administration of public finances. I am glad the representative supports that course. A certain percentage of the aid granted should be allocated to supporting organisations that monitor civil society.\nAnd last of all, the main problem, which is to put pressure on countries housing financial centres to freeze and repatriate illegal funds deposited there by corrupt rulers.

She defended budget support, saying it directly addresses weak public finance management and strengthens public procurement systems. \n\nNow, the user wants only the points attributed to her. The key issue here is budget support versus project-based aid. Her position is in favor of budget support. The argument she makes is that it helps with public finance management and procurement. There's no mention of proposals from her, just her defense of budget support. \n\nI need to structure this into the JSON format. The issueSum should mention budget support as a key issue. PositionSum states her support for budget support. ArgSum explains her reasoning about public finance and procurement. PropSum would be her proposal, but the summary only mentions her defense, not a specific proposal. Wait, the example response includes propSum even if it's just a proposal. But in the debate summary, she's defending budget support, which is a position, not a new proposal. So maybe propSum is empty here. Let me check the original instructions again.\n\nThe user said if there are no points, return an empty string. So in this case, she didn't make a proposal, just argued for budget support. So propSum would be empty. Let me confirm. The example response had \"He advocates for strict limitations...\" but in this case, she's not proposing a new policy but defending an existing approach. So propSum might not have anything. \n\nTherefore, the JSON should have issueSum about budget support, positionSum her support, argSum her reasons, and propSum as empty.
